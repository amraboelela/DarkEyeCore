                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>“The latest mass</u> murder in America didn’t involve guns,” Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said in a recorded campaign radio ad slated to appear on July 6. But when the Highland Park, Illinois, shooting took place on July 4, killing seven and injuring 46 others, the campaign scrambled to keep the ad from hitting the airwaves, according to emails obtained by The Intercept.</p>
<p>The campaign ad, approved by Johnson and paid for by his Senate campaign committee as he seeks reelection, laid blame for the “latest mass murder” on President Joe Biden’s immigration policies. “Fifty-three people, including five children, were murdered by human traffickers because Joe Biden’s open border policy is facilitating the multibillion-dollar business model of some of the most evil people on the planet,” the ad continued, referencing an <a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/texas/death-toll-rises-to-53-migrants-dead-after-truck-found-in-san-antonio-3-arrested/">abandoned truck trailer</a> recently discovered in San Antonio, Texas. “Human, sex, and drug trafficking are out of control because of Democrat governance.”</p>
<p>The day after the shooting, an executive from one of the companies contracted to produce the campaign radio ad, Katz Radio Group, frantically notified colleagues to suspend it. The following emails were provided to The Intercept by a source close to the Katz Radio Group on condition of anonymity to avoid reprisal.</p>

<p>In an email bearing the subject line “URGENT: Ron Johnson orders,” a vice president of sales at Katz Radio Group wrote, “they need the creative pulled ASAP. … If you listened to the spot it talks about mass shootings which obviously is not good creative after this past weekend (especially in Chicago).”</p>

<p>A day later, on July 6, a sales assistant at Cumulus Radio Station Group told colleagues in an email, “The rep for the Ron Johnson orders we entered yesterday is asking we pull the creative ASAP because of the nature of the message and how it’s a little too close to the mass shooting events over the weekend.”</p>
<p>Johnson has been a stalwart opponent of gun control throughout his career, <a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/politics/politifact/2022/06/29/fact-check-has-sen-ron-johnson-received-1-2-million-gun-lobby/7759752001/">having received</a> about $1.2 million in both direct and indirect contributions from pro-gun groups since his first campaign in 2010.

<p>Johnson is locked in what <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/06/22/marquette-poll-shows-tony-evers-ron-johnson-tight-races/7695043001/">polls suggest</a> will be a tight election in Wisconsin. Despite a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/09/ron-johnson-reelection/">previous pledge</a> not to seek a third term, Johnson announced that he would seek reelection in January.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>“No more drilling</u> on federal lands,” said former vice president, Delaware senator, and presidential candidate Joe Biden in March 2020. Debating his then-competitor Bernie Sanders on CNN, Biden <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M_kMDSdISQ">urged</a>: “No more drilling, including offshore, no ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period.”</p>
<p>On July 1, President Joe Biden’s administration put out a <a href="https://grist.org/climate-energy/biden-proposes-more-offshore-drilling-in-the-gulf-of-mexico-and-alaska/">new draft plan</a> to open up oil and gas drilling leases in the federal waters off the coast of Alaska and in the Gulf of Mexico. Released on the Friday before the Fourth of July holiday weekend, the plan represents a direct reversal not just from Biden’s campaign promises, but also from his earliest policies as president. On his first day in office, Biden issued a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/biden-administration-pauses-federal-drilling-program-climate-push-2021-01-21/">moratorium</a> on such leases, barring the Department of Interior from issuing new permits on federal lands. (The moratorium did nothing to stop drilling under existing permits — which many major fossil companies had <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN29Q1S5">preemptively stockpiled</a>.) In April, the administration <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-announces-significantly-reformed-onshore-oil-and-gas-lease-sales">announced</a> that it would resume selling new permits, and under the draft plan released Friday, the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska coast would be among the approved sites.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>The April <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-announces-significantly-reformed-onshore-oil-and-gas-lease-sales">announcement</a> pointed to “a first-ever increase” in the royalty rate for new competitive leases on public lands — from 12.5 percent to 18.75 percent — meant to soften the blow of the resumption of drilling by packaging it with additional revenue for the federal government and, theoretically, forcing the fossil fuel companies to pay more. In a <a href="https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/royalripoff-final.pdf">study</a> released in June, the progressive nonprofit advocacy group Public Citizen recommended that all drilling on federal lands be subject to the higher rate after decades without a royalty increase. The previous June, the group released another <a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/bidens-oil-letdown/">report</a> showing that Biden had, by then, already surpassed the monthly average number of drilling permits on public lands issued under former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The rate hike the Biden administration has implemented isn’t permanent, and it does not apply to the areas affected under the draft plan. As the recent Public Citizen study notes, federal waters beyond a depth of 200 meters were already subject to an 18.75 percent royalty rate. The rate increase only applies to onshore drilling, Interior Department spokesperson Melissa Schwartz told The Intercept, allowing offshore drilling that does not reach the 200-meter threshold to remain exempt. According to Schwartz, the new leases in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Alaska would be subject to royalties between zero and 11 percent.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[1] -->
<p>Beyond not being permanent, the royalty increase isn’t retroactive either. Like the lifted moratorium, it would not affect permits issued before the policy’s implementation. Public Citizen’s study showed that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/29/business/exxon-mobil-chevron-earnings.html">high gas prices</a> this year have driven<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/devon-energy-posts-higher-quarterly-profit-surging-oil-prices-2022-05-02/"> record profits</a> for the oil and gas industry — which have only been inflated by decades of low royalty rates. Twenty major onshore drilling companies — including Devon Energy, ConocoPhillips, and ExxonMobil — would have paid more than $1 billion in royalties last year, the study showed, had they not been subject to outdated and artificially low rates.</p>
<p>“In a year of record oil profits and inflation, the oil and gas industry is taking advantage of unparalleled tax breaks, subsidies, and exemptions,” Alan Zibel, research director at Public Citizen, said in a statement to The Intercept. “At the very least, these companies should pay a fair price for the resources they extract from public lands and be forced to cover the cost of environmental cleanup without additional costs to taxpayers.”</p>
<p>Cleanups and royalty increases, however, provide only a partial fix. The current rate increase could be undone just as easily as it was implemented, and even if it’s made permanent, any drilling on federal lands runs contrary to efforts to curb climate change and reduce fossil fuel dependency. Nothing would be as effective at stopping fossil fuel production — and its emissions — as a full ban.</p>
<p>Instead, Biden has proposed a gas tax holiday to make prices at the pump cheaper for consumers. In the<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-calls-for-a-three-month-federal-gas-tax-holiday/"> words</a> of the White House, Congress could suspend the federal gas tax for three months “to give Americans a little extra breathing room.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[2](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22left%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-left" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="left"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[2] -->Below-market rates for drilling on federal land have funneled close to $6 billion away from U.S. taxpayers to oil and gas companies over the last decade.<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[2] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[2] -->
<p>To be sure, high gas prices are hitting poor and working-class people the hardest. But there is no guarantee that suspending the federal gas tax would ease the cost of gas for consumers, particularly if oil and gas companies have any say. A recent<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/24/gas-tax-holidays-how-much-savings-drivers-saw-in-3-state-breaks.html"> study</a> of state-level gas tax holidays<a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2022/6/15/effects-of-a-state-gasoline-tax-holiday"> found</a> that savings were “mostly” passed onto consumers in the form of lower gas prices, but that those reductions in price often did not last the full term of the tax suspension. And the current tax structure for federal drilling gives oil and gas companies little incentive to pass on those savings. Below-market rates for drilling on federal land have funneled close to $6 billion away from U.S. taxpayers to oil and gas companies over the last decade.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, by contrast, Prime Minister Boris Johnson&#8217;s government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/26/business/uk-oil-company-profits-tax.html">announced in May</a> that it would impose a 25 percent tax on oil and gas companies&#8217; profits to alleviate pressure from the country’s rising cost of living. “The oil and gas sector is making extraordinary profits,”said Rishi Sunak, the recently departed chancellor of the exchequer, announcing the new measures. “I am sympathetic to the argument to tax those profits fairly.” (The tax, he promised, would not last beyond 2025.)</p>
<p>“While gas prices spike at the pump, these oil and gas drillers are not only squeezing drivers, they are fleecing taxpayers as well,” Zibel, of Public Citizen, said. “With the industry expected to report the highest profits on record this year, now is an ideal time for Congress and the Biden administration to get rid of longstanding giveaways to the oil and gas industry.”</p>
<p>From hurricanes to heat waves, the impacts of the climate crisis have grown more severe by the season. As a response, a fossil fuel royalty increase is not radical. Even Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., introduced a <a href="https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/grassley-rosen-introduce-bipartisan-fair-returns-for-public-lands-act-to-ensure-taxpayers-get-fair-share-for-oil-and-gas-leasing-on-public-lands">bill</a> last year to adjust rates in line with the economy. (It was referred to committee but never came to a vote; Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., was the bill’s only other co-sponsor.)</p>
<p>Asked if the Interior Department would, if nothing else, at least make the rate increase for drilling on federal lands permanent, Schwartz pointed The Intercept to the department’s existing public statements and a November <a href="https://doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/report-on-the-federal-oil-and-gas-leasing-program-doi-eo-14008.pdf">report</a> outlining the department’s reform and regulatory focus. The White House did not provide a comment.</p>

<p><u>It should come</u> as little surprise that the Biden administration and Democratic leadership in Congress are doing hardly anything to protect reproductive rights following the fall of Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p>Speaking on &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221; this Sunday, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra <a href="https://twitter.com/MeetThePress/status/1543587138129780736">made clear</a> that his agency had little interest in exploring ways to use federal powers to ensure abortions remain available in states that have banned the procedure.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[1] -->This unbound deference to the moribund institution of the Supreme Court is typical of the mainstream liberal response to the end of Roe.<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[1] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[1] -->
<p>“Unless we’re all going to say the word of the Supreme Court will no longer have value, we have to heed the word of the Supreme Court,” Becerra said, before dismissing the suggestion — supported by a number of left-wing Democrats and rejected by the White House — of using federal lands to provide abortion services in states with bans.</p>
<p>This unbound deference to the moribund institution of the Supreme Court — paired with a cowardly refusal to take any sort of risk in the service of women’s and other pregnant people’s lives — is typical of the mainstream liberal response to the end of Roe. On the Sunday talk show, Becerra rejected the centrist host’s suggestion to place temporary clinics on federal lands and force the courts to decide. Instead, the administration is throwing up its hands without even trying.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to overstate how badly Democrats dropped the ball on preventing Roe from being endangered and then preparing for it to be overturned. The world after Roe, though, is showing the liberal establishment’s cowardice and complicity when it comes to getting access to abortions for people who need them. From House Speaker Nancy Pelosi <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2022/06/nancy-pelosi-poem-roe-v-wade-overturn.html">reading an Israeli poem</a> to the repeated entreaties to vote harder, the utter failure is staggering.</p>
<p><u>Democrats in government</u> are not the only ones whose scant resistance will ensure that the Christo-fascists can enforce their post-Roe reality. Numerous health care providers and nonprofit organizations — most notably Planned Parenthood — are acting with preemptive zeal to remove reproductive and other health care services, even while legal gray areas abound.</p>
<p>Planned Parenthood, a group that does much good work but also exists firmly within the reluctant liberal establishment, has shown a lack of fortitude since the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#8217;s Health Organization decision took down Roe last month. Planned Parenthood of Montana will <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/montana-planned-parenthood-demands-proof-of-residency-for-medication-abortions-email-shows">no longer</a> provide medication abortions for patients from South Dakota, Arkansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma and will now require proof of residency for the treatment.</p>

<p>“The risks around cross-state provision of services are currently less than clear, with the potential for both civil and criminal action for providing abortions in states with bans,” wrote Montana Planned Parenthood CEO and President Martha Fuller in an internal email to her staff, which was <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/montana-planned-parenthood-demands-proof-of-residency-for-medication-abortions-email-shows">obtained</a> by the Daily Beast. “As we move forward, and learn more about risks, we will be offering guidance and implementing any necessary changes in policies and procedures for abortion care.”</p>

<p>Fuller is correct that the end of Roe brings about a new battleground of interstate juridical <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4032931">conflict</a>: Republican-led statehouses are trying to find ways to prosecute out-of-state abortion providers. Numerous blue states are, thankfully, passing laws to combat this in turn. None of it is settled, and it remains legal for Planned Parenthood of Montana, where abortion is legal, to provide abortion pills to patients from out of state. Fuller even noted that surgical abortions would remain available for patients from any state.</p>
<p>Continuing to provide medical abortions for all should be the very least a well-funded institution could do. Instead, in the name of litigiousness, Planned Parenthood handed yet another victory to the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/05/17/abortion-trans-health-care-pro-natalism-authoritarianism/">pro-natalist far right</a>.</p>
<p>In Missouri, meanwhile, St. Luke&#8217;s Health System, which operates 17 hospitals, pharmacies, and urgent care clinics in Kansas City, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/06/29/1108682251/kansas-city-plan-b?t=1657016763030">responded</a> to the fall of Roe by immediately ending the provision of Plan B emergency contraception pills.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[5](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A1%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="1"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[5] -->
<p>Within a day, however, the major health system reversed its decision. Missouri Gov. Mike Parson had clarified that the state’s new abortion ban did not affect Plan B or similar products.</p>
<p>The health care provider’s hair-trigger willingness to briefly stop providing Plan B remains chilling: a clear signal that as the GOP continues its fight to decimate all reproductive rights, including access to contraception, major hospital groups will follow in goose-step. In examples like St. Luke’s, the hospitals and their lawyers have been at the vanguard of care removal — even before a law was on the books to coerce action.</p>

<p><u>In the days</u> since the Supreme Court’s vile and long-predicted ruling, stories spread across social media of women who have been denied care, even care unrelated to ending a pregnancy.</p>
<p>A Virginia woman with the autoimmune disease lupus <a href="https://twitter.com/BeccaLizz/status/1542684777693814784">tweeted</a> that her doctor had stopped prescribing her medication, methotrexate, because it is considered an abortifacient: “in less than one week i lost access to healthcare that i need because the drug could be used to induce abortions,” she wrote. “I live in Virginia and abortion is legal here. but it is not protected by law and individual providers and pharmacies can decide what they will and won’t do re: abortifacients.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other stories are circulating of OB-GYNs in red states <a href="https://twitter.com/janevandis/status/1541916121741377538">waiting</a> to operate to end potentially deadly and always unviable ectopic pregnancies until the patient’s life is in clear danger, so as to be in compliance with abortion bans’ “medical emergency” exemptions.</p>
<p>When Republicans designed abortion ban legislation to evade federal court challenges by relying instead on vigilante enforcement — like Texas’s <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/06/24/roe-anti-abortion-enforcement-criminalize/">pernicious</a> Senate Bill 8 — it was in the knowledge that health care providers would respond with litigious compliance. Under a privatized model of medical care, the bottom line will always trump a broader commitment to human health and flourishing.</p>

<p>That so many have given up on reproductive rights so swiftly, even those purportedly dedicated to reproductive health care, is a grim reminder that neither the medical nor the political establishment can be relied upon as allies in the struggle for a robust reproductive justice. It&#8217;s hardly news: The U.S. medical system has long treated poor Black and brown women — who disproportionately suffer under abortion bans — as disposable.</p>
<p>Thankfully, while establishment Democrats, major nonprofits, and private health care groups act in timid compliance to fascist rule, sites of genuine resistance continue to grow. Collectives and individuals have long been committed to sharing information, support, <a href="https://abortionfunds.org/about/">resources</a>, <a href="https://www.plancpills.org/">abortion pills</a>, and services. They understand the need to navigate legal gray areas and work within, outside, and against violent laws.</p>
<p>Those who continue to take risks to fight for reproductive justice make clear that real resistance is possible. They clarify, too, that those caving so readily to a fascist status quo are making a choice to stand on the wrong side of history.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Less than an hour</u> after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional protection for abortion, Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry crowed on Twitter that abortion was now illegal in the state. “Because of #SCOTUS ruling in #Dobbs, Louisiana’s trigger law banning #abortion is now in effect,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/AGJeffLandry/status/1540343439086190592">wrote</a>.</p>
<p>But exactly which trigger law Landry was referencing wasn’t clear. Louisiana has passed several such laws over the years, all of which remain on the books, variously overlap, prohibit different conduct, offer different exceptions, and impose different punishments. In its zeal to ban abortion, Louisiana has created a mess of contradictions.</p>
<p>That prompted the Center for Reproductive Rights to <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/LA-Trigger-Ban-Claim.pdf">file suit in state court</a> on behalf of several plaintiffs, including Shreveport’s <a href="https://www.hopemedical.com/">Hope Medical Group for Women</a>, arguing that the bans outlawing abortion in Louisiana violated the state’s constitution. “Louisiana’s rushed and poorly conceived trigger laws are unconstitutionally vague and violate due process,” said Joanna Wright, an attorney with Boies Schiller Flexner LLP and lead counsel on the case. “The Louisiana Constitution does not tolerate such a state of affairs and this lawsuit requires Louisiana to comport with the rule of law as required by its own constitution.”</p>
<p>On June 27, a state judge in New Orleans issued a <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/CIVIL-DISTRICT-COURT-FOR-THE-PARISH-OF-ORLEANS.pdf">temporary restraining order</a> that blocked the laws from taking effect pending a hearing slated for July 8, thereby restoring abortion services. “We are committed to this monumental legal challenge,” Kathaleen Pitmann, administrator for the Hope clinic, said in a statement, “to ensure our patients’ wellbeing and so that they may draw strength from our dedication to this fight.”</p>

<p>Louisiana is among 13 states with <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2022/06/13-states-have-abortion-trigger-bans-heres-what-happens-when-roe-overturned">trigger laws</a> on the books; another nine have ostensibly retained pre-Roe laws banning abortion. Together, they constitute a group of zombie laws that have lain dormant waiting for a Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, which the court did on June 24 in the Mississippi case <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf">Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</a>. In all, 22 states are poised to ban all or most abortions, while four more will likely try to do so in the coming weeks or months. But <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2021/10/26-states-are-certain-or-likely-ban-abortion-without-roe-heres-which-ones-and-why">many of the states</a> with anti-abortion statutes on the books have multiple, often competing laws, leading to confusion over which of the laws is actually controlling.</p>

<p>Anti-abortion actors have long claimed that overturning Roe — and sending the question of whether individuals should enjoy reproductive freedom back to state politicians — would simplify the legal landscape. But legal scholars say the opposite is true, as The Intercept has <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/06/18/abortion-roe-state-laws-missouri-illinois/">previously reported</a>. The lack of a single standard regarding the legality of abortion is unleashing a flood of litigation as restrictions are challenged against individual state constitutions, and competing visions about reproductive freedom give rise to <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/06/18/abortion-roe-state-laws-missouri-illinois/">new interstate battles</a>.</p>
<p>By striking down Roe, the Supreme Court gave “a green light to anti-abortion legislators to be as invasive as they possibly can,” said David Cohen, a professor at Drexel University’s Kline School of Law and co-author of “<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4032931">The New Abortion Battleground</a>,” a forthcoming article in the Columbia Law Review. The looming legal fights, he said, will include an increased focus on state constitutional challenges. “People are going to be looking to the state court cases as the places where there can possibly be a win.”</p>

<p>Since the Dobbs ruling, 10 states have announced enforcement of their abortion bans: Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio (which has a six-week ban), <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/05/20/oklahoma-abortion-ban-surveillance-criminalization/">Oklahoma</a>, South Dakota, Tennessee (also a six-week ban), Texas, and Utah. But just as swiftly came the lawsuits challenging those restrictions. To date, legal challenges in <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/emw-womens-surgical-center-v-cameron-restraining-order">Kentucky</a>, Louisiana, and <a href="https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/chicagostarmedia.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/b6/fb6f09af-d829-5b9a-bfc7-c5d1e5f26027/62bb96062257b.file.pdf">Utah</a> have been successful — at least for now.</p>
<p>As in Louisiana, Texas’s various laws banning abortion have created a legal quagmire. Abortion access in Texas was already obstructed by the notorious sue-they-neighbor law, <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/07/15/texas-abortion-lawsuit-sb8/">Senate Bill 8</a>, which allows private citizens to sue anyone they imagine has violated the state’s six-week ban. Last year lawmakers also passed a trigger ban slated to take effect 30 days after the Supreme Court issues its official judgment in the Dobbs case — a final order that follows the roughly <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/supct/rule_44#:~:text=1.,shortens%20or%20extends%20the%20time.">monthlong window</a> during which a litigant can ask the court to reconsider.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced that the state could enforce a pre-Roe ban codified in 1925. In a <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/executive-management/Post-Roe%20Advisory.pdf">legal advisory</a> released just after the Dobbs opinion, Paxton encouraged state prosecutors to “immediately pursue” criminal charges against providers based on the old law. “Although these statutes were unenforceable while Roe was on the books, they are still Texas law,” he wrote. “Under these pre-Roe statutes, abortion providers could be criminally liable for providing abortions starting today.”</p>
<p>On June 27, the Center for Reproductive Rights <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022-06-27-Petition-3.pdf">filed suit</a> on behalf of a handful of Texas abortion providers, arguing that the pre-Roe ban had been scrubbed from statute after 1973 and that its provisions conflicted with the newer trigger ban. The pre-Roe ban “cannot be harmonized with the trigger ban,” which establishes “an entirely different and irreconcilable range of penalties for the same offense” and “cannot be enforced consistent with due process,” the lawsuit reads. The following morning, a state judge in Houston issued a <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/22072284/tx-pre-roe-ban-tro.pdf">temporary restraining order</a> and set a hearing on the matter. Paxton, however, rushed to the all-Republican Texas Supreme Court, which lifted the order on Friday <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/TX-SUPREME-COURT_STAY-ORDER-ISSUED__MAND_FILECOPY-002.pdf">without addressing any of the problems</a> raised in the lower court.</p>
<p>“These laws are confusing, unnecessary, and cruel,” said Marc Hearron, senior counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights. “Texas’s trigger ban is not scheduled to take effect for another two months, if not longer. This law from nearly 100 years ago is banning essential health care prematurely, despite clearly being long repealed.”</p>

<p>According to the Guttmacher Institute, only <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/abortion-policy-absence-roe">four states</a> have constitutions that explicitly do not protect abortion rights. A majority of the first wave of lawsuits seeking to block bans are based on state constitutional protections that lawyers argue are more expansive than those provided in the U.S. Constitution. Lawsuits pending in <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/uploads/filer_public/b3/5c/b35c779c-14b4-480b-9ff9-6174b28b2bfa/verified_petition_for_writ_3.pdf">Idaho</a>, <a href="https://www.acluohio.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/verified_complaint.pdf">Ohio</a>, and <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/uploads/filer_public/57/ca/57ca44fc-624b-4f2a-9eba-3d2824563df5/complaint_for_declaratory_and_injunctive_relief.pdf">Utah</a>, for example, cite broad privacy rights and liberty interests, arguing that abortion bans discriminate against women and violate equal protection guarantees. A suit in <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/OK-Pre-Roe-and-612-Complaint.pdf">Oklahoma</a> contends that the state&#8217;s competing abortion bans violate due process as well as a constitutional &#8220;right to personal autonomy and bodily integrity.&#8221; The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/emw-womens-surgical-center-v-cameron-complaint">Kentucky</a> lawsuit argues that the state’s two abortion bans (a trigger ban and a six-week ban) violate state constitutional rights of privacy and self-determination.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2022-06-27-MS-State-Court-Complaint_Stamped.pdf">suit in Mississippi</a>, meanwhile, filed on behalf of the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/01/18/abortion-roe-v-wade-reproductive-rights/">Jackson Women’s Health Organization</a>, argues that the state’s Supreme Court already <a href="https://casetext.com/case/pro-choice-mississippi-v-fordice">concluded</a> in 1998 that the constitution explicitly protected abortion. “As confirmed by the Mississippi Supreme Court … the decision about whether and when to have children belongs to individuals and families, not to the state’s politicians,” said Rob McDuff, a lawyer with the <a href="https://mscenterforjustice.org/">Mississippi Center for Justice</a>, which is among the groups representing the state’s lone abortion provider.</p>
<p>And in Florida, a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/florida-15-week-abortion-ban-complaint">suit</a> challenging a new 15-week ban notes that in 1980, voters amended the state constitution to provide robust individual privacy rights, which were <a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2022/06/08/can-florida-privacy-law-protect-abortion-rights-roe-v-wade/7536003001/">designed to include</a> the right to abortion; in 2012, voters <a href="https://rewirenewsgroup.com/article/2012/11/06/florida-voters-reject-amendment-6-no-taxpayer-funding-abortion-amendment-0/">rejected</a> an attempt to repeal that right. Protecting the right to abortion in Florida is considered <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/maps/what-if-roe-fell/">crucial</a> to maintaining access in the South.</p>
<p>On Thursday, a state district judge said he would block the law from taking effect. “Florida passed into its constitution an explicit right of privacy that is not contained in the U.S. Constitution,” state judge John Cooper <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/06/30/abortion-florida-ban-judge-blocks">said</a>. “The Florida Supreme Court has determined, in its words, ‘Florida’s privacy provision is clearly implicated in a woman’s decision on whether or not to continue her pregnancy.’” The state is expected to appeal, which could imperil the injunction, said Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, deputy director for reproductive freedom at the American Civil Liberties Union. &#8220;But we intend to continue to fight for that injunction to remain in effect at every level of the court system in Florida.&#8221;</p>
<p>During a joint press call with the ACLU and Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/">Center for Reproductive Rights</a>, which <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/12/02/abortion-supreme-court-mississippi/">argued the Dobbs case</a>, called the Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling a &#8220;crushing blow&#8221; that &#8220;upended the idea that a constitutional right is one that can be relied on.&#8221; But she noted that the three groups were longtime partners in the fight for reproductive freedom and would continue to press for equal rights. &#8220;We were, and are, ready,&#8221; she said. And the lawsuits that have been filed so far are just the beginning. &#8220;You can expect more cases to be coming,&#8221; she promised. &#8220;Every additional day and every additional hour that we can block a ban is making a huge difference for the patients in the waiting rooms.&#8221;</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>The illness was</u> mysterious. A 25-year-old graduate student had been hospitalized with a high fever, muscle and joint pain, a stiff neck, fatigue, sores in her throat, and a metallic taste in her mouth. She soon developed an angry rash. To make the diagnosis, her doctors had an important data point to consider: Days earlier, the woman had returned to the United States from a field expedition in South Sudan and Uganda, where she had been capturing and collecting the blood and tissue of bats and rodents. That information proved critical — and is newly relevant given concerns that the pandemic may have come from a research accident. Three days after she was admitted to the hospital in 2012, tests determined that the student was infected with a novel virus that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25919464/">infects</a> a type of fruit bat that lives in the rural areas of Uganda.</p>
<p>The graduate student recovered and left the hospital two weeks later. But the incident, which was <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3901491/">written</a> up in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases in 2014, proved scientifically important. Not only did it allow for the identification of the Sosuga virus — a paramyxovirus named for Southern Sudan and Uganda — and the knowledge that the bat virus can infect and sicken people, the woman’s infection also pointed to the dangers posed by the kind of research she was doing: trapping, manipulating, and dissecting animals suspected of being infected with novel disease-causing viruses.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>Biosafety experts have long worried over the possibility that scientists seeking dangerous viruses in the wild could inadvertently become infected in the course of either capturing or coming into contact with the saliva, urine, or feces of the animals. The case of the Sosuga virus shows that those concerns are well founded.</p>
<p>Virus hunter Michael Callahan, an infectious disease doctor who has worked for federal agencies on global disease outbreak and the tracking of wildlife pathogens, has vividly described the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/09/15/covid-origin-investigation-china-cooperation-511898">high risks faced by field researchers</a>. “Squirming, clawed and toothy animals bite and scratch during collection of body fluids. Teeth and talons easily penetrate the thin gloves required to maintain dexterity when handling fragile wildlife,” he wrote in Politico in 2021. “The fact that researchers are not infected every time they do a field collection is a question that continues to stump us.”</p>
<p>With more than 6 million people now dead from Covid-19, the catastrophic potential of a researcher becoming infected with a wildlife pathogen has become inescapable. While the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/collections/origins-of-covid/">origins of the current pandemic are still unclear</a>, it remains possible that virus hunting could have been the cause. Rocco Casagrande, a biochemist who was hired by the National Institutes of Health’s Office of Science Policy to <a href="https://www.gryphonscientific.com/our-work/gain-of-function/#1545916149863-1000f696-4d32">assess the risks of gain-of-function research</a>, thinks a natural spillover of the virus from animals to people, a lab accident, or what he calls a &#8220;prospecting based accident&#8221; are equally likely potential causes of the initial outbreak. He imagined the prospecting scenario as &#8220;the researchers in Wuhan looking for bat viruses found one and got infected outside of the lab.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even as the very real chance remains that the search for new viruses led to this cataclysmic event, scientists hoping to prevent viral outbreaks continue to seek out new bat coronaviruses and other potential pandemic pathogens around the world.</p>
<h2>Ask the Bats</h2>
<p>The search for pathogens that infect animals is driven by the desire to prevent and prepare for their possible transmission to people. But that work, which spans the globe and is <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/12/28/covid-pandemic-virus-hunters-ecohealth-alliance-peter-daszak-wuhan/">funded in large part by the U.S. government</a>, can sometimes result in human infection — exactly the outcome it is meant to prevent.</p>
<p class="p1"><!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A2%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="2"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[1] --></p>
<p>Virus hunting — or wildlife disease ecology, as DeeAnn Reeder prefers to call it — is a field that has come under increasing scrutiny during the Covid pandemic. For Reeder, a professor of biology at Bucknell College who led the 2012 expedition on which the graduate student was infected, one of the central purposes of her research in Africa on bats’ immune responses to viruses is to understand how humans might react to the same infectious agents, knowledge she says can protect us if the pathogens jump from animals to humans. “If you want to understand how to survive a coronavirus, or if you want to understand how to survive a filovirus — Ebola fits within that context — you need to ask the bats because they know how to do it,” said Reeder.</p>
<p>Reeder, who put up her first bat net in South Sudan in 2008, continues to do <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/UBO5KpZq7ke5sqoRskHZ8Q/project-details/10360547">wildlife research in Uganda</a>. No one has previously reported her connection to the work. “I&#8217;ve never been contacted by a reporter on that particular story,” Reeder said, after being asked whether the Sosuga virus infection occurred during research on one of her projects. “I&#8217;ve always been surprised about that.” Reeder would not confirm the identity of the researcher on her project who was sickened, citing privacy concerns.</p>
<p>The Sosuga case shows that concerns about viral transmission from wild animals to researchers are not just theoretical. It is still unclear exactly how the infection occurred. While the graduate student only occasionally used protective gear when working with animal specimens, when she visited the bat caves she wore a paper Tyvek suit that’s become the hallmark of virus hunters, gum boots, bite-resistant gloves, and even an air-powered respirator known as a PAPR that looks like an astronaut’s helmet. The researcher did not report being bitten or scratched by any of the animals she encountered.</p>
<p>“Maybe outside the cave before they put the respirators on, she leaned against a rock that had been peed on, because we know that it could be in the kidneys of this particular bat species,” said Reeder. “But that&#8217;s just conjecture, which is the scary part.”<br />

<h2>Cowboys and Cowgirls</h2>
<p>Reeder carries a card in her wallet she hopes medical professionals will read should she herself wind up in the emergency room with a mysterious infectious disease someday. “It says, ‘Attention medical personnel: I study wildlife disease. Here&#8217;s all the things you should test me for should I present to you in the emergency room,’” she explained.</p>
<p>Reeder describes herself and other researchers in her field as “a little bit like cowboys and cowgirls — we go to a foreign place and we catch exotic things.” Yet she’s grown increasingly cautious during her years in the field. “When I first started this work, nobody was wearing PPE. It just wasn&#8217;t a thing,” she said. “I thought we were good if I didn&#8217;t have my coffee cup on the same table when I was doing dissections.”</p>
<p>Despite her growing concern about biosafety, Reeder has still had a few worrisome interactions with bats herself. “I had one bite me. That big canine tooth went right into my knuckle, and for like two years, whenever it was cold, my knuckle would hurt,” she recently recalled. And in 2017, Reeder was stuck with a needle that had just come out of a bat that she knew could have carried the deadly Ebola virus.</p>
<p>“I was like, wow, OK. So I make notes in my notebook, started counting 21 days, which is the incubation period for Ebola,” said Reeder. “I&#8217;m mostly kind of flippant about that. But I can tell you I knew when that 21 days was up.”</p>
<p>Yet even after these experiences, Reeder said there are rare times when she still eschews personal protective equipment: “If I’ve got a live bat, I can&#8217;t go into a village and show up in my space suit.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[3] -->
<p>Most interactions with bats don’t cause disease. But the risk of viral infections remains — and many professional scientists and hobbyists don’t even take the basic precautions to protect themselves from it, according to a <a href="https://bdj.pensoft.net/articles.php?id=68052&amp;journal_name=bdj">study</a> published in 2021 in Biodiversity Data. The authors, who include Reeder, analyzed 759 of the more than 43,000 photos of people holding bats taken that were uploaded since the 1980s to <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a>, a popular biodiversity tracking app. While the percentage of the app’s users who wore gloves when they held bats has increased over time, even in 2021, less than half of the people holding bats, both dead and live, were wearing gloves.</p>
<p>“This lack of adherence to even minimal biosafety practices may jeopardize both the safety of the bat and the handler,” the authors concluded.</p>
<p>Reeder said those who continue to openly flout the recommendations to wear protective gear are increasingly met with disapproval within her scientific community. “If somebody is at a conference and they show pictures of themselves in the field not wearing a face mask, and not wearing gloves, even latex gloves, there’s a little bit of criticism,” she said. “A sort of public shaming.”</p>
<h2>Ongoing Risk</h2>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/scientific-advisory-group-on-the-origins-of-novel-pathogens-report">recent report</a> from the World Health Organization makes clear, there is still no definitive proof of how Covid-19 originated. And an infection that occurred during the collection of dangerous new coronaviruses from bats is among the possible explanations for the initial coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan in 2019. There is no question that the National Institutes of Health, which indirectly funded bat coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, is <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/01/20/coronavirus-research-china-ecohealth-fbi/">still struggling</a> to fully understand the biosafety precautions taken around that research. Yet the U.S. government continues to support similar research around the world, with grants to numerous organizations including EcoHealth Alliance, the NIH grantee that worked with the Wuhan institute.</p>
<p>EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit research group based in New York, received a <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/document/2021/09/08/understanding-the-risk-of-bat-coronavirus-emergence/">$3.1 million grant</a> in 2014 from the NIH, some of which was spent on the collection of novel bat coronaviruses in rural China. Specifically, the organization awarded a subgrant of some $750,00 to researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. In April 2020, at the request of President Donald Trump, the NIH suspended that grant. But four months later, the NIH awarded EcoHealth Alliance another, larger grant.

<p>Like the first grant, the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/document/2021/09/08/understanding-risk-of-zoonotic-virus-emergence-in-emerging-infectious-disease-hotspots-of-southeast-asia/">second grant</a> — titled “Understanding the Risk of Zoonotic Virus Emergence in Emerging Infectious Disease Hotspots of Southeast Asia” — pays for the collection of what it calls “high zoonotic potential viruses” from remote locations in Southeast Asia. It also funds experiments involving the infection of humanized mice with hybrid viruses created from the new viruses, which are designed to gauge the threat those viruses pose to humans. The grant is funded through 2025.</p>
<p>Other branches of the U.S. government also continue to fund the collection and study of novel viruses that could infect humans, including <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/oct-5-2021-usaid-announces-new-125-million-project-detect-unknown-viruses">DEEP VZN</a>, a $125 million project funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the <a href="https://www.fic.nih.gov/Programs/Pages/ecology-infectious-diseases.aspx">Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases Program</a>, which is jointly funded by NIH, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the National Science Foundation.</p>

<p>Despite concerns about biosafety lapses in U.S.-funded research in Wuhan and a lack of oversight from both NIH and EcoHealth Alliance, there are no agreed-upon standards for ensuring the safety of ongoing research.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is currently very little biosafety guidance specifically for this kind of biological fieldwork,&#8221; Filippa Lentzos, a biosecurity expert who works at King’s College London, wrote in an email to The Intercept. &#8220;This is a major gap in biorisk management that urgently needs to be addressed both nationally and internationally, not least because this kind of fieldwork is on the rise.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the pandemic, David Gillum, assistant vice president for environmental health and safety at Arizona State University, began meeting with a small group of experts over Zoom to discuss biosafety practices for researchers working with bats in the wild. &#8220;It&#8217;s guidance on what to wear as personal protective equipment, what vaccinations should you have before you go to a certain area, what medications should you bring,&#8221; said Gillum. The group&#8217;s recommendations are expected to be published soon in the journal Applied Biosafety. Up until now, he said, &#8220;Everybody has been just kind of winging it.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Gillum and other biosafety experts say they hope national and international field work guidelines will ultimately be put in place, they expect the process to take years.</p>
<p>In the absence of such clear recommendations — and with institutions coming up with their own varied approaches to biosafety — a range of researchers face the risk of infection from pathogens in wildlife, according to Casagrande, the biochemist. &#8220;And that includes people specifically trying to find viruses but also people who aren&#8217;t,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Plenty of biologists who work with wildlife also don&#8217;t take precautions. And many times they get infected by things.&#8221;<br />

<h2>A Fine Balance</h2>
<p>While the pandemic has sparked a debate about the safety of studying dangerous viruses, most scientists agree on the need for at least some viral surveillance. To Reeder, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has made the value of her work only clearer. “Our understanding of the extraordinary diversity of SARS-related coronaviruses in bats in Southeast Asia is really critical for our pandemic preparedness, for our ability to predict what’s going to bind to human receptors,” she said. “We need to understand what&#8217;s there.”</p>
<p>As she sees it, that benefit is worth whatever risk it entails. And, in the case of the graduate student infected with the Sosuga virus, the cost wasn’t great. The virus didn’t kill her — and, critically, it didn’t spread from her to other people. Looking ahead, Reeder said, improved adherence to protective gear should protect against future viral jumps from animals to researchers.</p>
<p>“I think you just do your best, right?” said Reeder. “You try to look for those gaps. You put your gloves on, then you put your Tyvek suit on over those, and then you take Gorilla tape, and you wrap your wrist with Gorilla tape to make sure that you don&#8217;t have a gap as you move your arms,” she said, noting that colleagues in the field tend to help one another. “You can call each other out on stuff. You know, ‘Hey, it looks like your mask has slipped.’ But it&#8217;s never perfect, and this case just sort of illustrates that for us.”</p>
<p>The case of the woman who was infected working with bats in Uganda also taught Reeder how, at least that time, luck was on her side: “This could have been really, really ugly.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Small teams of</u> U.S. Special Operations forces are involved in a low-profile proxy war program on a far greater scale than previously known, according to exclusive documents and interviews with more than a dozen current and former government officials.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/03/20/joe-biden-special-operations-forces/">The Intercept</a> and other outlets have previously reported on the Pentagon’s use of the secretive 127e authority in multiple <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/revealed-the-us-militarys-36-codenamed-operations-in-africa-090000841.html">African countries</a>, a new document obtained through the Freedom of Information Act offers the first official confirmation that at least 14 127e programs were also active in the greater Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region as recently as 2020. In total, between 2017 and 2020, U.S. commandos conducted at least 23 separate 127e programs across the world.</p>
<p>Separately, Joseph Votel, a retired four-star Army general who headed both Special Operations Command and Central Command, which oversees U.S. military efforts in the Middle East, confirmed the existence of previously unrevealed 127e <strong>“</strong>counterterrorism<strong>”</strong> efforts in Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>Another former senior defense official, who requested anonymity to discuss a classified program, confirmed that an earlier version of the 127e program had also been in place in Iraq. A <a href="https://twitter.com/wesleysmorgan/status/1042243862943748097">127e program in Tunisia</a>, code-named Obsidian Tower, which has never been acknowledged by the Pentagon or previously identified as a use of the 127e authority, resulted in combat by U.S. forces alongside local surrogates in 2017, according to another set of documents obtained by The Intercept. A third document, a secret memo that was redacted and declassified for release to The Intercept, sheds light on hallmarks of the program, including use of the authority to provide access to areas of the world otherwise inaccessible even to the most elite U.S. troops.</p>
<p>The documents and interviews provide the most detailed picture yet of an obscure funding authority that allows American commandos to conduct counterterrorism operations “<a href="https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Maier%20APQ%20responses.pdf">by, with, and through</a>” foreign and irregular partner forces around the world. Basic information about these missions — <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/TE/TE10044">where</a> they are conducted, their frequency and targets, and the foreign forces the U.S. relies on to carry them out — are unknown even to most members of relevant congressional committees and key State Department personnel.</p>

<p>Through 127e, the U.S. arms, trains, and provides intelligence to foreign forces. But unlike traditional foreign assistance programs, which are primarily intended to build local capacity, 127e partners are then dispatched on U.S.-directed missions, targeting U.S. enemies to achieve U.S. aims. “The foreign participants in a 127-echo program are filling gaps that we don&#8217;t have enough Americans to fill,” a former senior defense official involved with the program told The Intercept. “If someone were to call a 127-echo program a proxy operation, it would be hard to argue with them.”</p>
<p>Retired generals with intimate knowledge of the 127e program — known in military parlance as “127-echo” — say that it is extremely effective in targeting militant groups while reducing risk to U.S. forces. But experts told The Intercept that use of the little-known authority raises grave accountability and oversight concerns and potentially violates the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>One of the documents obtained by The Intercept puts the cost of 127e operations between 2017 and 2020 at $310 million, a fraction of U.S. military spending over that time period but a significant increase from the $25 million budget allocated to the program when it was first authorized, under a different name, <a href="https://tjaglcspublic.army.mil/documents/27431/13299844/2020-Issue-1-Funding+Surrogate+Forces+in+the+Fight+Against+Terrorism.pdf/1017528c-ed0d-4bbe-ac38-95186e3d63d9">in 2005</a>.</p>

<p>While critics contend that, due to a lack of oversight, 127e programs risk involving the United States in human rights abuses and entangling the U.S. in foreign conflicts unbeknownst to Congress and the American people, former commanders say the 127e authority is crucial to combating terrorism.</p>
<p>“I think this is an invaluable authority,” Votel told The Intercept. “It provides the ability to pursue U.S. counterterrorism objectives with local forces that can be tailored to the unique circumstances of the specific area of operations.”</p>
<p>The 127e authority first faced significant scrutiny after four U.S. soldiers were killed by Islamic State militants during a 2017 ambush in Niger and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/senators-us-troops-africa-pentagon-2017-10">several high-ranking senators</a> claimed to know little about U.S. operations there. <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/02/secret-war-africa-pentagon-664005">Previous reporting</a>, by <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/03/20/joe-biden-special-operations-forces/">The Intercept</a> and others, has documented 127e efforts in <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/revealed-the-us-militarys-36-codenamed-operations-in-africa-090000841.html">multiple African countries</a>, including a <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/03/09/cameroon-military-abuses-bir-127e/">partnership with a notoriously abusive unit</a> of the Cameroonian military that continued long after its members were connected to mass atrocities.</p>

<p>For more than a year, the White House has failed to provide The Intercept with substantive comment about operations by U.S. commandos outside conventional war zones and specifically failed to address the use of 127e programs. Asked for a general comment about the utility of the 127e authority and its role in the administration&#8217;s counterterrorism strategy, Patrick Evans, a National Security Council spokesperson, replied: “These all fall under the Department of Defense.” The Pentagon and Special Operations Command refuse to comment on the 127e authority. “We do not provide information about 127e programs because they are classified,” SOCOM spokesperson Ken McGraw told The Intercept.</p>
<p>Critics of 127e warn that in addition to the risk of unanticipated military escalation and the potential costs of engaging in up to a dozen conflicts around the world, some operations may amount to an unlawful use of force. Because most members of Congress — including those directly responsible for overseeing foreign affairs — have no input and little visibility into where and how the programs are run, 127e-related hostilities can lack the congressional authorization required by the U.S. Constitution, argued Katherine Ebright, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice.</p>
<p>“There’s reason to suspect the Department of Defense has used 127e partners to engage in combat beyond the scope of any authorization for use of military force or permissible self-defense,” Ebright told The Intercept, noting substantial confusion at the Pentagon and in Congress over a stipulation that 127e programs support only authorized ongoing military operations. “That kind of unauthorized use of force, even through partners rather than U.S. soldiers themselves, would contravene constitutional principles.”</p>

<h2>Global Proxy War</h2>
<p>The origins of the 127e program can be traced back to the earliest days of the U.S. war in Afghanistan, as commandos and CIA personnel sought to support the Afghan Northern Alliance in its fight against the Taliban. Army Special Operations Command soon realized that it lacked the authority to provide direct payments to its new proxies and was forced to rely on CIA funding. This prompted a <a href="https://civiliansinconflict.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CIVIC_US_Report_Drones_Final.pdf">broader push by SOCOM</a> to secure the ability to support foreign forces in so-called missions, a military corollary to the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/12/18/afghanistan-cia-militia-01-strike-force/">CIA’s use of militia surrogates</a>. First known as Section 1208, the authority was also deployed in the early years of the Iraq invasion, according to a former senior defense official. It was ultimately enshrined in U.S. law under U.S.C. Title 10 § 127e.</p>
<p>127e is one of several virtually unknown authorities granted to the Defense Department by Congress over the last two decades that allow U.S. commandos to conduct operations on the fringes of war and with minimal outside oversight. While 127e focuses on “counterterrorism,” other authorities allow elite forces — Navy SEALs, Army Green Berets, and Marine Raiders among them — to conduct clandestine <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/127f">intelligence and counterintelligence operations</a> or assist foreign forces in <a href="https://irp.fas.org/doddir/dod/dtm-18-005.pdf">irregular warfare</a>, primarily in the context of so-called great power competition. In April, top Special Operations officials unveiled a new “<a href="https://www.socom.mil/Pages/SOF-Vision-and-Strategy.aspx">Vision and Strategy</a>” framework that appears to endorse continued reliance on the 127e concept by leveraging “burden sharing partnerships to achieve objectives within an acceptable level of risk.”</p>

<p>Gen. Richard D. Clarke, the current Special Operations commander, <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/AP/AP02/20190409/109281/HHRG-116-AP02-Wstate-ClarkeR-20190409.pdf">testified before Congress</a> in 2019 that 127e programs “directly resulted in the capture or killing of thousands of terrorists, disrupted terrorist networks and activities, and denied terrorists operating space across a wide range of operating environments, at a fraction of the cost of other programs.”</p>
<p>Clarke’s claims cannot be verified. A SOCOM spokesperson told The Intercept that the command does not have figures on those captured or killed during 127e missions. It is also not known how many foreign forces and civilians have been killed in these operations, but a former defense official confirmed to The Intercept that there have been U.S. casualties, even as U.S. troops are traditionally expected to stay behind “<a href="https://www.stimson.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CIVIC_US_Report_ETR-FINAL1.pdf">last cover and concealment</a>” during a foreign partner’s operations.</p>
<p>The documents obtained by The Intercept tout the importance of the authority, particularly in providing U.S. special operators a way into difficult-to-access areas. According to a memo, one 127e program provided “the only human physical access to areas,” with local partners “focused on finding, fixing, and finishing” enemy forces. Another 127e program targeting Al Qaeda and its affiliates similarly allowed commandos to project “combat power into previously-inaccessible VEO [violent extremist organization] safe havens.”</p>

<p>Some documents obtained via FOIA are so heavily redacted that it is difficult to identify the countries where the programs took place and the forces with which the U.S. partnered. The Intercept previously identified the BIR, or Rapid Intervention Battalion, as the notorious Cameroonian military unit with which the U.S. ran a 127e program. The Intercept has now identified another previously unknown partnership with the G2 Strike Force, or G2SF, an elite special unit of the Lebanese military with which the U.S. partnered to target ISIS and Al Qaeda affiliates in Lebanon.</p>
<p>Votel confirmed that the 127e in Lebanon was code-named Lion Hunter. He also acknowledged previously unknown 127e programs in Syria; Yemen, known as Yukon Hunter; and Egypt, code-named Enigma Hunter, where U.S. Special Operations forces partnered with the Egyptian military to target ISIS militants in the Sinai Peninsula. He said that the chief of the Egyptian military intelligence service provided “strong support” for Enigma Hunter and that American troops did not accompany their local partners into combat there, as is common in other African countries.</p>

<p>The U.S. has a long history of assistance to both the Egyptian and Lebanese militaries, but the use of Egyptian and Lebanese forces as proxies for U.S. counterterrorism missions marked a significant development in those relationships, several experts noted.</p>
<p>Two experts on Lebanese security noted that the G2SF is an elite, secretive unit mostly tasked with intelligence work and that it was not surprising that it was the unit chosen for the 127e program by U.S. Special Operations, with which it already enjoyed a <a href="https://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/NEWS-ARTICLES/News-Article-View/Article/923748/centcom-commander-general-votel-visits-lebanon/">strong relationship</a>. One noted that unlike other elements of the country’s security forces, the unit was “far less politicized.”</p>

<p>The situation is more complex in Egypt, where the military has for decades relied on billions of dollars in U.S. security assistance but resisted U.S. efforts to track how that assistance is used.</p>
<p>While Sinai is subject to a near-total media blackout, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/04/egypt-video-of-extrajudicial-executions-offers-glimpse-of-hidden-abuses-by-the-military-in-north-sinai/">human rights groups</a> have documented <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/05/28/egypt-serious-abuses-war-crimes-north-sinai">widespread abuses</a> by the Egyptian military there, including “arbitrary arrests, forced disappearances, torture, extrajudicial killings, and possibly unlawful air and ground attacks against civilians.”</p>
<p>“There are legitimate issues with the U.S. partnering with some units of the Egyptian military,” said Seth Binder, director of advocacy at the Project on Middle East Democracy. “There has been great documentation, by Amnesty and Human Rights Watch, of numerous human rights abuses in the Sinai by the Egyptian military. Are these the same units we&#8217;re partnering with to carry out operations? That&#8217;s a real concern.”</p>
<p>The Egyptian Embassy in the United States did not respond to a request for comment, but in a <a href="https://www.state.gov/joint-statement-on-the-u-s-egypt-strategic-dialogue/">joint statement</a> last fall, U.S. and Egyptian officials committed to “discussing best practices in reducing civilian harm in military operations” — a tacit admission that civilian harm remained an issue. Requests for interviews with the embassies of Iraq, Tunisia, and Yemen, as well as Lebanon’s Ministry of Defense, went unanswered.</p>

<h2>No Vetting, No Oversight</h2>
<p>While the documents obtained by The Intercept offer clues about the scope and contours of the 127e program, much remains unknown to both the public and members of Congress. Relevant reports required by law are classified at a level that prevents most congressional staffers from accessing them. A government official familiar with the program, who<strong> </strong>requested anonymity to discuss it, estimated that only a handful of people on Congress’s armed services and intelligence committees read such reports. Congressional foreign affairs and relations committees — even though they have primary responsibility for deciding where the U.S. is at war<b> </b>and can use force — do not receive them. And most congressional representatives and staff with clearance to access the reports do not know to ask for them. “It’s true that any member of Congress could read any of these reports, but I mean, they don&#8217;t even know they exist,” the government official added. “It was designed to prevent oversight.”</p>
<p>But it is not just Congress that’s largely kept in the dark about the program: Officials at the State Department with the relevant expertise are also often unaware. While 127e requires signoff by the chief of mission in the country where the program is carried out, detailed information is rarely shared by those diplomats with officials in Washington.</p>

<p>The lack of oversight across levels of the U.S. government is in part the result of the extreme secrecy with which defense officials have shielded their authority over the program — and of the scant pushback they have faced. “It’s State not knowing what they don’t know, so they don’t even know to ask. It’s the ambassadors being sort of wowed by these four-star generals who come in and say, ‘If you don’t let us do this, everyone’s going to die,’” the government official said. “DOD views this as a small, tiny program that doesn’t have foreign policy implications, so, ‘Let’s just do it. The less people get in our way, the easier.’”</p>
<p>Sarah Harrison, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group and formerly associate general counsel at the Defense Department’s Office of General Counsel, International Affairs, echoed that assessment. “HASC and SASC appear opposed to increasing oversight of 127-echo. They are not inclined to change the statute to strengthen State’s oversight, nor are they adequately sharing documents related to the program with personal [congressional] staff,” she said, using the acronyms of the House Armed Services Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee. “This may seem like an arcane, bureaucratic issue, but it really matters for oversight of the 127-echo program and all other programs that are run in secret.”</p>
<p>Those programs include an authority, known as <a href="https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dtm/DTM-18-005.pdf?ver=2020-08-11-152602-477">Section </a><a href="https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dtm/DTM-18-005.pdf?ver=2020-08-11-152602-477">1202</a>, that first appeared in the <a href="https://civiliansinconflict.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CIVIC_US_Report_Drones_Final.pdf">2018 National Defense Authorization Act</a> and provides “support to foreign forces, <a href="https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dtm/DTM-18-005.pdf?ver=2020-08-11-152602-477">irregular forces</a>, groups, or individuals” that are taking part in irregular warfare and are explicitly focused on so-called near-peer competitors. Congress has also authorized the secretary of defense to “expend up to $15,000,000 in any fiscal year for clandestine activities for any purpose the Secretary determines to be proper for preparation of the environment for operations of a confidential nature” under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/127f">10 USC § 127f</a>, or “127 foxtrot.” <a href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/Downloads/IE/NDAA%2020%20PLAW-116publ92.pdf">Section 1057 authority</a> similarly allows for intelligence and counterintelligence activities in response to threats of a “confidential, extraordinary, or emergency nature.”</p>
<p>“This has been sort of the story for a lot of these DOD-run programs,” said Stephen Semler, co-founder of the Security Policy Reform Institute, a grassroots-funded U.S. foreign policy think tank. “The Special Operations community likes autonomy a lot. They don&#8217;t like going through bureaucracy, so they always invent authorities, trying to find ways around having their operations delayed for any reason.”</p>
<p>“The problem is this stuff is so normalized,” he added. “There should be more attention paid to these train-and-equip authorities, whether it&#8217;s special forces or DOD regular, because it&#8217;s really kind of a PR-friendly way to sell endless war.”</p>

<p><u>In Robert Kuttner’s</u> new book, “Going Big: FDR’s Legacy, Biden’s New Deal, and the Struggle to Save Democracy,” he explains how we got to our present political inflection point, <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/06/13/franklin-roosevelt-new-deal-robert-kuttner-book/">how high the stakes are</a>, and what comes next. Kuttner — who co-founded the Economic Policy Institute as well as The American Prospect — joins Jon Schwarz to discuss.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Deconstructed theme song.]</span></p>
<p><b>Jon Schwarz: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m Jon Schwarz, a writer at The Intercept, filling in for Ryan Grim on this week’s episode of Deconstructed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For anyone with a progressive political perspective, this is a terrible moment. The big Democratic initiatives on increasing the minimum wage, making it easier to join a union, starting to deal with global warming, and more, are stalled and seemingly dead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Roe v. Wade has just been struck down by the ultra-conservative Supreme Court. And most of the Democratic Party’s leadership, including President Biden, seem to have few plans to seriously fight back on any of this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But when you need to figure where to go next, you always have to start by understanding how you got to where you are. That’s especially true in America, where we’re discouraged from remembering anything that happened before the last ad for Domino’s. And that’s why Robert Kuttner’s new book “Going Big: FDR’s Legacy, Biden’s New Deal, and the Struggle to Save Democracy” is genuinely important right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kuttner is an prolific journalist, he’s the co-founder and co-editor of the American Prospect, one of the zestiest liberal publications in the U.S., he co-founded the Economic Policy Institute, one of the vanishingly small number of think tanks in Washington, D.C. that cares about regular people, and he’s just been generally agitating for a better country for over 50 years, going back to his first job working for I.F. Stone, the muckraking reporter — and we like to think — spiritual father of The Intercept.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right now, Kuttner is worried in a way he has not been before about what could happen next in American politics. But he also believes this time could be a huge opportunity, if the Democratic Party wants to seize it — and, in fact, that’s probably the only way to prevent the worst from happening. It’s a gigantic crisis and a gigantic opportunity — or, as Homer Simpson would say:</span></p>
<p><b>Dan Castellaneta [as Homer Simpson]: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, crisitunity!</span></p>
<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Bob, thanks for coming on Deconstructed. And thank you for writing your new book, “Going Big.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I could, I would make everyone in America read it, especially right now. “Going Big” is essentially the story of American political history from the New Deal and Franklin D. Roosevelt, starting in the 1930s until today, and what that means for this political moment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And what makes the story, as you tell it, so compelling is: First you excavate a ton of stuff that’s largely been forgotten — forgotten sometimes accidentally, and sometimes on purpose. And second: You live this history close up as an observer and also a participant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so to start with, I want to quote a part of your book, so people understand where you’re coming from, which is that you write:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am a child of the New Deal. My parents bought their first home with a government-insured mortgage. When my father was stricken with cancer, the VA paid for excellent medical care. After he died, my mother was able to keep our house thanks to my dad’s veteran’s benefits and her widow’s pension from Social Security … My generation grew up thinking of the system wrought by the Roosevelt revolution as normal. … But this seemingly permanent social contract was exceptional. … Above all, it was fragile, built on circumstances and luck as much as enduring structural change.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So that’s from your book. And before we get to the history dealt with in your book, I wanted to set the stage with my own understanding of sort of pre-New Deal history very, very, very quickly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I see it, from what I know, capitalism didn’t truly get going in the U.S. until the 1800s, particularly after the Civil War. And what became clear pretty quickly is that human beings just cannot coexist with capitalism, unless it was strongly regulated and constrained. And otherwise, you were going to get some extreme political reactions to try to deal with it so that people could just simply live. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that’s what happened in Europe during this period, there was the rise of communism as an answer to what to do with capitalism. And obviously, the rich people of Europe did not like that answer, but they also didn’t want some middle ground where capitalism was constrained, and so they aided and abetted the rise of fascism. And that brings us to the 1930s: The world economy had collapsed. People around the planet were completely desperate and looking for a solution. And in lots of Europe, that solution was fascism, but it was not in America. And why?</span></p>
<p><b>RK: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">We got very, very lucky. There was an assassination attempt on Roosevelt’s life in Florida in January or February 1933 before he takes the oath of office, and the assassin gets within 6 or 7 feet of the president-elect and hits the mayor of Chicago by mistake who dies. Roosevelt is not struck. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And had the assassin’s bullet been true, the President of the United States in March 1933 would have been John Nance Garner, Cactus Jack, and we would not have had a New Deal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We also got lucky in that Roosevelt was gradually getting more and more radicalized. He had been a liberal progressive governor of New York but he starts out campaigning against Hoover from the right for deficit spending. And it’s only during that period between the time of his election and the time of his inauguration that he really appreciates how bad things are, and how radical the remedies need to be. And then you have the first 100 days, of course, and a lot more. And you also have people pushing on Roosevelt from his left. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And, miraculously, it all comes together. We have a huge amount of regulation of finance. We have the invention of the modern housing mortgage system; four different New Deal agencies. We have public capital through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. We have social security. We have the Wagner Act, and within the space of a decade, complemented by World War II, when the state is even more powerful, we have the government in league with organized workers acting as a counterweight to capitalism. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And it works. It works. The New Deal gets the economy about halfway out of the Great Depression; World War II does the rest. It’s the very rare circumstance where we don’t have a depression after a war. It’s the very rare circumstance where the war pushes politics to the left rather than to the right. And Jeff Cowie, who’s a historian, calls the New Deal, “the great exception.” He’s absolutely right. And yet, as I write in this book, “Going Big,” even the New Deal was not radical enough, because it was vulnerable to being overturned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And we see this as soon as the Republicans take back Congress in 1946. One of the first things they pass is the Taft-Hartley Act, making the Wagner Act much less effective. And the whole history from 1946 on, really is the slow evisceration of the New Deal, which really gathers force in the 1970s and, tragically, it is a Democratic president who is as responsible for this — Jimmy Carter — as Richard Nixon is, and the rest of the book really talks about how Democratic presidents buy into neoliberalism, weaken the New Deal model, and set the stage for Donald Trump.</span></p>
<p><b>JS:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Yes, that is one of the most valuable parts of the book, I think, is the history as it deals with Democratic presidents. And it’s quite a disappointment [laughs] for anyone who hears the standard story from the Democratic Party. But it is undeniable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And can you talk a little bit more about the history after World War II, and the significance of the end of union organizing that to the degree that it was happening during the ’30s?</span></p>
<p><b>RK: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Well it’s a long half life. So by 1946 — 1947 is when Taft-Hartley is passed, weakening the Wagner Act — there has been so much organizing in the late ’30s and then in the war. Roosevelt was terrific. Roosevelt basically said to war production contractors: If you want to work a contract, you have to recognize your union. And World War II was even better for unions than the last years of the 1930s were. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So by the time the Taft-Hartley Act was enacted in 1947, labor has organized about a third of the workforce. And because even with Taft-Hartley, the big corporations did not actively fight unions, so as GM, and Ford, and GE, and the big industrial behemoths take on new workers, they take on new workers into union shops. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so the labor movement really does just fine, right through the 1960s. So it’s a slow decline. And Eisenhower doesn’t really try to reverse the New Deal. You know, the Democrats had tried to nominate Eisenhower before the Republicans did. He’s a general, he’s a war hero, he’s a president above party. So the New Deal era really persists for another 30 years before business takes off the gloves and before Democratic presidents get corrupted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the other interesting thing about this period is that if you look at the Bretton Woods system, the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944, where Keynes is the chairman of the conference — Keynes having been a scathing critic of the Treaty of Versailles, in 1919 — is the rare historical figure who gets a duel over 25 years later. And so Keynes, and Roosevelt’s people, Harry Dexter White, decide that in order to protect the New Deal at home, we need to take the New Deal global. And so instead of allowing laissez-faire capitalism to set the terms of the post war reconstruction, you have the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, there was supposed to be an International Labor Organization to have high labor standards enforced globally, and so you did not have speculation in currencies the way you had after World War I, you had fixed exchange rates, and you had a system — very deliberately created — that allowed countries to pursue full-employment welfare states domestically without being undercut by the demands of private capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And if you want to contrast with how that works, after this was all eviscerated when Greece gets into trouble — through no fault of the socialist government, by the way, that was in power in 2009 — because of the sins of other countries, the remedy is austerity inflicted on the Greeks. But no such punishment was enacted on Britain after World War II, because the terms of the global economy were different. So the creation of a global economic order that was friendly to New Deal-style managed capitalism was another great accomplishment. And the unwinding of that, Clinton being the prime villain, is part of the evisceration of the New Deal order. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And what happens is the inertial power of the New Deal pretty much continues until the stagflation of the 1970s, which gives the economic right another turn at proffering its economic theories that the Great Depression was just an accidental mistake. And the varieties of free market economics work perfectly well, after all, and then Jimmy Carter, as just a totally hapless figure, who’s the most conservative Democrat since Grover Cleveland, not a New Dealer at all, is floundering around trying to figure out what to do, decides that one way to get inflation under control is by deregulating all of the industries that had been regulated in the New Deal, and maybe that’ll lead to competition and competition will restrain prices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So it’s under Carter that we deregulate airlines, we deregulate railroads, we deregulate trucking, and even though Carter had a very strong working majority in Congress, he doesn’t lift a finger to put any teeth back in the Wagner Act, because he views trade unions as instruments of inflation. And he had the votes to pass labor-law reform, to repeal some of Taft-Hartley, and restore the original power of the Wagner Act; he chose not to use that power. And then he turns Paul Volcker loose, to put interest rates up to 21 percent. So just a complete failure [laughs] as a Democrat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And, of course, this ushers in Ronald Reagan, and then Reagan, knowing full well what he was doing, takes it to the next level. And then, with Clinton, Clinton buys into the whole neoliberal story, aided and abetted by Bob Rubin, former co-CEO of Goldman Sachs, who has a self interest, as well as an ideological predisposition, to wanting to deregulate financial markets. And the other thing Clinton did was he makes budget-balance a kind of Holy Grail. And, unfortunately, that becomes entrenched in the Democratic Party so that Obama, after the financial collapse, after Obama kind of does a half-baked job of trying to re-regulate finance; in January of 2010, when the economy is still in recession, Obama listens to his conservative, Rubinite economic advisors, and decides to pivot to deficit reduction long before the recession is over. And the result of this is the blowout midterm election of 2010. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So the script that Carter, and Clinton, and Obama followed is just fatal to the Democratic Party whose core ideology is that affirmative government can help working people. And when affirmative government stops helping working people, social issues, racism, cultural issues, crowd out economic issues, and Hillary Clinton becomes the fatal instrument of this thinking that if you just go left on cultural issues, and defend transgender bathrooms, that will make up for going right on economic issues. And of course, this was like, waving a red flag at the Trumpies. And it was sort of the final coup de grâce of this series of one fatal neoliberal Democratic president after another squandering the Roosevelt legacy and the Roosevelt formula.</span></p>
<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, it is remarkable, looking at all of these Democratic presidents who seem to see the problems that the Democratic Party faces, and that they face in their term in office, and decide that, you know, the solution is for the Democratic Party to commit suicide. </span></p>
<p><b>RK:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Yeah, or to become more like the Republican Party. </span></p>
<p><b>JS:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Yeah.</span></p>
<p><b>RK: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">And I think a lot of this is the influence of finance, Wall Street, in the counsels of the Democratic Party. I mean, with the exception of Bob Reich, and Joe Stiglitz, and Laura Tyson, who later goes on a number of boards of financial companies, the power players inside the Clinton White House are all Wall Street people. And Reich and Stiglitz are kind of the loyal opposition, and they lose a lot more battles than they win. And of course, they turn out to be prophetic — especially Stiglitz. I mean, if you go back and read Stiglitz’s book on the ’90s, every bit of it was prophetic, and yet, Summers, Larry Summers, who screwed up everything he touched, he becomes treated as the Prophet and Stiglitz is still the voice in the wilderness.</span></p>
<p><b>JS:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Yes. Now, I think we should stop here for a moment, and talk a little bit about Larry Summers, because we both have a strong personal distaste, I think it’s fair to say, [laughs] for him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Who is Larry Summers? Where did he come from? And what did he do?</span></p>
<p><b>RK: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, OK, so Larry Summers is a wonder kid. He’s a very smart, young economist, one of the youngest economists ever tenured, maybe the youngest economist ever tenured, Harvard. He’s sort of middle-of-the-road economically; ideologically, he attaches himself to some moderate Keynesians; he also attaches himself to Martin Feldstein. And ultimately gets a job at the World Bank, I believe, or maybe it was the IMF. </span></p>
<p><b>JS:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Oh, it was definitely the World Bank. </span></p>
<p><b>RK: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">The World Bank. </span></p>
<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s where he wrote the famous memo about dumping toxic waste in the third world. </span></p>
<p><b>RK:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Yeah, that’s right. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then he gets plucked by Rubin to a real power position, which is the deputy secretary of the Treasury for international economic affairs. So when I did my long investigative piece about, part of which found its way into this book, one of the things I discovered is that in addition to all of Summers’ other screw ups, he as much as any other public official in the Clinton era, was responsible for Russia ending up with Vladimir Putin. Because Summers, knowing nothing about Russia, passionately believes that the way to bring Russia into the capitalist family is a kind of extreme version of the cold bath cure, where you marketize as rapidly as possible, you privatize as rapidly as possible, and this leads to kleptocrats buying state assets at bargain basement prices, it leads to a depression in Russia, which discredits the small-d democrats, and the inheritors of this are the Communist Party on one side, and the Putin party on the other side. So in addition to anything else that you might have against Larry Summers, he is as responsible as any other American for Vladimir Putin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So he becomes a protégé of Rubin, and Rubin likes Summers’ brilliance. Summers likes Rubin as a tutor on how you make money on Wall Street. After he leaves he gets connected with an investment bank, makes a lot of money. And Rubin then sponsors him for his disastrous reign as president of Harvard. And then Summers is very eager to go back into government, which he does, when Rubin persuades Barack Obama that Summers walks on water, and Obama makes Summers his top economic guy, where he is loath to be too tough on Wall Street, where he’s loath to see the government have a big deficit, and continues to believe in kind of ultra-globalization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, after this, as president of Harvard, of course, he has another fiasco and Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown and a couple of other Democratic senators — Jeff Merkley — get credit for keeping Summers out of the job that he wanted his his career capper, namely chair of the Fed. And it was the Democrats in the Senate who really prevented Obama from appointing Summers to chair the Fed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it isn’t just Summers as a person. It’s Summers as a kind of emblematic figure of the kind of Wall Street-afflicted economists who lead the Democrats down the road to hell.</span></p>
<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, and I think to put some dollar terms on what this meant for Larry Summers personally, the extraordinary fact is that I believe this was during the interregnum of the Bush administration. So he leaves as Treasury secretary. And then, even as he was a tenured professor at Harvard, he worked one day a week at a hedge fund and was paid $5 million a year for this eight hours per week job he had. </span></p>
<p><b>RK:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Yeah. He’s working for D.E. Shaw. And it’s interesting, those figures were briefly disclosed. They have not been disclosed lately. But, yeah, it’s an astonishing story. But it’s interesting not because Larry Summers is a bad guy, but because it’s emblematic of a whole era and a whole trajectory. </span></p>
<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, I mean, I think to normal people, the amount of money you make as a tenured professor at Harvard would probably be enough. </span></p>
<p><b>RK: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, and Summers makes more money than your average tenured professor, I mean a senior, tenured professor might make $250,000 or $300,000. Larry’s easily making double or triple that.</span></p>
<p><b>JS:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> That’s right. But that was not enough. That and total job security was not enough. And he needed more. That’s incredible to me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s also incredible to me that schools like Harvard have no rules, as far as I know, about what professors can do outside of their job. That was my understanding of tenure, it was supposed to be, in return for giving you tenure, you’re supposed to serve as a somewhat disinterested expert to help normal people learn about the world. But apparently, that’s not how it works. </span></p>
<p><b>RK: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, we could spend this whole conversation talking about the corruption of higher education and the corruption of the Democratic Party. I’d like to save at least a few minutes to talk about Joe Biden, and where this Republic is now.</span></p>
<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes. That’s how we got here. And where are we now?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So Biden is very interesting. I mean, Joe Biden was kind of a standard issue, liberal Democrat, not any kind of a left progressive. But he had this working class Joe side. And he was the accidental nominee, of course, because he was doing terribly in the primaries. And if Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders had not run against each other, one of them would have been the nominee, and one of them probably would have been President. So that’s thing one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then thing two, after he went to the South Carolina primary, and there’s this bandwagon effect, Warren folds her campaign, realizing that Biden is going to be the nominee, and I might as well throw in with him. And in exchange for that, Warren has a tremendous amount of influence, both over policy ideas, and over personnel. Warren loves to say personnel is policy. And of course it is. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So a lot of people who were well to the left of who Joe Biden was in his prior life end up with powerful positions in the Biden administration, and Biden himself moves left, under pressure of circumstances. Neoliberalism is finally demonstrated to be a practical failure. And so the center of the Democratic Party has moved left. And so you have this bizarre situation where you have the soul of Elizabeth Warren in the body of Joe Biden. And that’s like one of these mythical beasts. I mean, it doesn’t quite compute. And Biden has done not a bad job of acting out Elizabeth Warren, and even acting out some of Franklin Roosevelt. But of course, the problem is, Franklin Roosevelt had an enormous working majority in Congress, if you leave out race. Now, obviously, he made terrible compromises with Southern racists, but as long as you leave out race, which comes back to haunt the Democratic Party, the fatal compromise the Roosevelt made, he had a working majority to get the New Deal — the fairly radical New Deal through Congress, as long as it did not change racial relations in the south. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Biden doesn’t have a working majority in Congress. And for the first six months, it kind of looks like: Well, maybe he does have a working majority. So he gets, you know, he gets his initial $1.9 trillion program through, he gets all of his nominees with one exception confirmed, and Manchin is not fighting him. And then, by September, Manchin decides that he really doesn’t like some of the Biden program. And Biden looks like a president who can govern and his popularity ratings go South, and then you have inflation and the supply-chain shock, and all of a sudden Biden starts looking like a failed president. So the question is: Where the hell are we now? [Laughs.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the ability of the Biden administration to keep Trump at bay, to hold at least one house of Congress — which I think is actually quite possible, I think Democrats have a good shot at holding the Senate, the only thing standing between us and fascism. And what’s interesting about what we learned from the January 6 Committee is that the result of this may be that Trump doesn’t get nominated, but Trumpism without Trump is probably even more dangerous than Trumpism with Trump. Because as we learn how completely crazy out of his mind Trump was, you realize that if somebody who weren’t so crazy, who were a little craftier, or a little more normal sounding, had been president, he probably would have been reelected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I would much rather, if I were the Democratic nominee in 2024, run against Trump than I would want to run against DeSantis or Hawley or some of the other Trumpers who are not as crazy as Trump. So that’s one thing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I think the other thing, and I cannot stress this too strongly, Joe Biden needs to be more of an economic radical. The pollster Stan Greenberg did some very interesting polling on this. When Biden says: Hey, look at all that I accomplished, the unemployment rate is down, and I did all these great things with the ARPA Act, and the bipartisan infrastructure act, you get a kind of cognitive dissonance where working class voters say: What do you mean, you get all these great things, my life has turned to shit? And my life has been going down the drain for 40 years. And if you’re telling me that you did all these great things for the country, I’m going to vote for somebody else. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So instead of bragging about all the good stuff he did for the country, Biden should be wailing away at the banks, and the corporations, and the platform monopolies, and the oil companies, and identifying himself with the with the aspirations of working families who haven’t really gotten a raise in 40 years, and worse than that, their life horizons and the life horizons of their children are much worse than the statistics suggest. You can’t afford to buy a house, you can’t afford to go to college, your health security is going down the drain, and Biden needs to validate those feelings and be the champion of doing something about it and not just pussyfoot around with: Maybe I’ll cancel some student debt and maybe I won’t, and maybe I’ll save you 19 cents a gallon on the gas tax, and maybe I won’t. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean, he could be a much more robust version of where he started. And he could be out in the Midwest crusading for making it in America: Let’s reshore production, let’s deal with inflation by bringing production home and taking good jobs. And I think, Jon, you or I could write that speech. And I think the reason Biden doesn’t do that is he’s whipsawed between his own doubts about whether his popularity ratings would sink the ticket, and the doubts of some congressional candidates who aren’t sure they want him in their districts, and I think Trump is so crazy, as revealed by the January 6 hearings, we all knew how crazy he was but it turns out he was even crazier. And the combination of the attempted coup, the fact that most people don’t agree with the right-wing Republican Supreme Court on abortion, they don’t agree with a right-wing Supreme Court on gun rights, they don’t agree with a coup d&#8217;état, and this gives Democrats something to run against. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the problem is, as I wrote in a column last week, is if the debate is between abortion rights and $5/gallon gasoline, $5/gallon gasoline just might win, meaning the Republicans might use that to deflect attention from these horrible court decisions. And so Biden has to be more of an economic progressive populist, à la FDR.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Musical interlude.]</span></p>
<p><b>JS:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Yes. And my question is: Why do Democrats seem to be incapable of this? Because as I have experienced politics in my life, the core thing that a political party needs, and individual politicians need, is a story that they’re telling. </span></p>
<p><b>RK:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Right.</span></p>
<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">About who we are, how we got here, what we’re going to do now, and any story, any good story, needs heroes and needs villains. </span></p>
<p><b>RK:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Right. </span></p>
<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">And the Republicans are great at telling a story. And their story is false, and pernicious, and dangerous, and frightening. </span></p>
<p><b>RK: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Yep. </span></p>
<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, you know, the core danger for Americans now is elementary school teachers. So it’s a terrible story. But any story always beats no story. And the Democrats will not tell a story even when they have this fantastic story to tell, which is the subject of your book. And so, based on your experience, participating and observing in American politics, why is this so difficult for them?</span></p>
<p><b>RK: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I think some Democrats still have the right story. So Elizabeth Warren certainly has a story. It’s a coherent story. It’s a brilliant story. It’s a well articulated story. Ditto Sherrod Brown, ditto Bernie Sanders. I am certainly rooting for John Fetterman’s pacemaker, because I think he’s the next Bernie Sanders. He’s my candidate for the 2024 nomination to the Democratic Party. So some Democrats have a story. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then you have Democrats who are corrupted. There’s no such thing as a centrist Democrat; there’s a corrupted Democrat. The so-called centrist Democrats, most of them are in bed with Wall Street. And that’s why they’re centrist. Then you have Democrats who are in swing districts who think that they have to be centrist on some issues to win elections. But, interestingly, most of the worst centrist Democrats are in safe Democratic seats, where their centrism doesn’t do a damn thing to help them get elected. So, you know, it’s a pickup team. It’s not an ideologically coherent party, the way the Republican Party is today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Republican Party, by the way, did not used to be an ideologically coherent party. When I worked in the Senate you had 20, not just moderate Republicans, you had liberal Republicans who voted with the Democrats, not just on civil rights issues, but on economic regulation issues, and they voted for trade unions. So it’s only in the last 40 years that Republicans have become an ideologically coherent party. The Democrats as far back as you go, certainly back 100 years, had been a kind of pickup team full of contradictions. In the ’30s, you have southern racists in the same party with northern socialists, and trade unionists and wonky academics — and somehow Roosevelt holds all of this together. But when you don’t have an extraordinary President holding it together, the centripetal force drives the party apart.</span></p>
<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes. What I see from the outside, is that it seems that it’s not just this kind of standard, straightforward corruption about where you’re getting your campaign contributions from and who you’re going to go to work for after you get out of office. But there does seem to be a truly deep intellectual and moral corruption, where a lot of these people do actually believe that this is as good as it gets, this is as far as we can possibly take things. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And they do fundamentally agree with a right-wing economic perspective. And it’s only very recently, as far as I can tell, that too many, or any fair number of Democratic politicians seem to have broken out of that. And that seems to have been the work of decades of people like you.</span></p>
<p><b>RK:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Well, let me let me take issue with that in one respect. So in the ’70s, I was a Senate investigator, I worked for William Proxmire, on the Banking Committee staff, and I tell the story in the book: In those years, you could take a drive from Washington State to Pennsylvania, and not pass through his state with a Republican senator, and even better, all of those Democratic senators were progressives, they were labor Democrats. So in that era, right up until 1980, when Democrats lose control of the Senate, most Democrats outside the Deep South were progressive Democrats; they were labor Democrats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then what happens is you get this whole new Democrat garbage. And you get the Gary Hart, Paul Tsongas kind of technocratic, post-ideological, let’s use technology to try and break out of these political polarities. And then you get the Democratic Leadership Council, which is sort of one part tactical and one part purely corrupt. Because if you move to the center on this stuff, you can raise all kinds of business money as Al From certainly did. And From was the head of the DLC, recruits Clinton, I tell this story in my book, to be the the DLC candidate for president and triples or quadruples his salary as governor of Arkansas to head the DLC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So it’s a combination of expediency and corruption and wanting to sample your own smoke.</span></p>
<p><b>JS:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Yes, I assume — I’ve never had this experience myself — but I assume if you go to a fundraiser with a lot of people from Wall Street, they make a very compelling case. It’si not just that they’re giving you money. It’s also like: Wow. I don’t know how Wall Street works. These people really seem to know what they’re talking about, and I better do what they say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So as I say, I think that shocking and appalling amount of it is honestly taking these awful, awful positions.</span></p>
<p><b>RK:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Yeah. But I do think that the congressional Democratic Party has always been to the left of the presidential Democratic Party. You go back to the Clinton era, it was Congress that fought Clinton on NAFTA; it was Congress that fought Clinton on replacing AFDC with his terrible welfare plan, TANF, which is inadequate and demeaning. And you have Ted Kennedy as sort of the lodestar in the Senate, and it’s the Presidential party that finds it easier to just buy into neoliberalism, get in bed with Wall Street; it’s the congressional party that’s very skeptical about so-called free trade, Dick Gephardt and company being very critical of what became the World Trade Organization. But there’s definitely a tug of war inside the Democratic Party. But at least there’s a tug of war, at least there are some progressives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the interesting thing about Biden is that he has made more common cause with the progressives in the party than he has with the conservatives. And that’s progress. I just wish he were 49, rather than 79. And I wish that he were more assertive. I wish he were getting out of the office more. And I certainly hope, even though he’s what we’ve got for now, certainly hope he’s not the nominee in 2024. </span></p>
<p><b>JS:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> One interesting thing that I looked up recently, that seems to have some explanatory power to me is that I believe every single Democratic presidential nominee since 1984 has been a lawyer. </span></p>
<p><b>RK:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Huh. </span></p>
<p><b>JS: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">And it’s just a fact that being a lawyer, you are trained to, first of all, think that power is all about words. And we just need to pass the right words into law and that will change things. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But secondly, lawyers are the bit players in life on earth. They are the counselors, they are the ones who have clients for whom they are acting, but they are not actors themselves. And I think that that is a real problem with the mindset at the top of the Democratic Party, like they seem to be scared to exercise power themselves and are intimidated by the idea that they might actually be able to change the world.</span></p>
<p><b>RK: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah. I think Obama’s temporizing will go down in history is one of the great tragedies of the American experience and of the Democratic Party. And that’s a whole other subject, but —</span></p>
<p><b>JS:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> But he’s definitely someone with a lawyer brain. No question about it. </span></p>
<p><b>RK:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Yeah, there’s a caution. And Biden, at least, at least until he got his glock cleaned by Manchin, and Sinema, and company, was capable of some bold strokes during his first year in office, which is when I wrote this book, which is why had some hope that, you know, he might succeed in standing between where we are now and full-on fascism.</span></p>
<p><b>JS:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Yeah. And I think that we should for sure, before wrapping this up, talk about how dangerous this moment truly is. The stakes are so high, that it’s a little bit difficult to express. This is, I would say, for me, certainly the most frightening political moment that I have experienced in my life. And what is your perspective on this?</span></p>
<p><b>RK: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">In order for us to be spared full-on fascism, just about everything has to break right. And let me define what I mean by that: Democrats have to hold one House. And I think they do stand a decent chance of holding the Senate. If you break this out state by state, Trump has helped by getting some real lunatic nominees in places like Georgia who are going to be rather hard to get elected in the general [election]. So it would help enormously if they hold one House because that means that Biden can still get nominees through Congress. So that’s thing one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Secondly, inflation has to begin subsiding; Biden has to have some success in reclaiming supply chains; we have to not be humiliated in the Ukraine. And that unfortunately, probably means a war of attrition is the best we can get because Putin is not going to make a deal with us, even a deal at the expense of the Zelensky and then the Republican crackup has to continue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And what is encouraging here is that I think the Republican Party is now splitting into not two but four factions. You’ve got the hardcore Trumpies; you’ve got the MAGA people who are Trumpies without Trump — and that’s a wonderful split. You’ve got the kind of softcore, traditional business Republicans who really don’t like MAGA but are willing to work with MAGA as long as MAGA did their bidding in terms of legislation that helped corporations; and then you’ve got a small handful of people like Liz Cheney, and that number is growing given what people are seeing in the hearings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would like to see Charlie Baker, my governor here in Massachusetts, run as an Independent, because I think that would peel off 10 or 15 percent of the Republican vote. So the Republican crackup could help. Then we have to have a strong nominee, who is much more effective than Biden in 2024, who is a true progressive, an economic progressive, and that’s probably a category of two or maybe three if we think Warren is still young enough. It’s Sherrod Brown; it’s John Fetterman. And I think either of them would do very well against a Republican. And I still worry that there are Republicans who would be much more effective candidates than Trump. So a lot of stuff has to break right. And probably the single most important thing is the Democrats have to hold the White House in 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, of course, you have the Supreme Court. And the Supreme Court is doing such incredible damage to what’s left of the Roosevelt administrative state that I think remedies that seem too radical for the mainstream I think now have to be taken seriously. And that means Congress can legislate in area, after area, after area to fence off certain legislation from judicial review. They can do that. Judicial review is not in the Constitution. And I wrote a column; I was very pleased to see Pelosi act on this the next day, although I don’t think I should claim credit for it, because it was an obvious idea. Thomas, in his concurring opinion, puts out this completely lunatic idea that: Hey, let’s go beyond repealing Roe. Let’s repeal Lawrence, and let’s repeal Griswold. Let’s ban gay marriage, let’s ban gay rights, and let’s even ban birth control. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so what Pelosi did — I wrote a column suggesting this — Pelosi is introducing legislation saying: Let’s make these statutory. We could make these guarantees statutory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other thing you can do is you can put a mandatory status change where after you’ve been a Supreme Court justice for 15 years, you have to take senior status, which is done in the rest of the federal judiciary, and then you don’t get to vote. Or you could expand the court. And I think until last week, most people felt that this was just going too far. But now I think if we don’t want every progressive legislation that’s been enacted since 1937 to be eviscerated, another thing Democrats have to do is reign in the court, and if we can elect a president in 2024, and we can elect a majority in Congress, we could actually do that.</span></p>
<p><b>JS:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Yeah. And I would also encourage people to think in these terms. I think this is kind of the stratosphere of American politics, like how things are functioning way up to the top and a lot of people look at the system, and they’re like: Well, I’m here standing on Earth, and what can I possibly do? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I would certainly say that people can do a lot, especially with the internet, there are opportunities for people to become leaders locally on a state level, even on a national level very, very quickly. So I would say Ocasio-Cortez is an example of that, Chris Smalls, like people can take a stand somewhere, and all of a sudden be known to a huge amount of people can be leaders in a really significant way, like leadership like this is what is going to eventually push to the purported leadership in Washington, D.C. and in state governments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So as I say, I’d really encourage people to say: If you think you could be a leader, you’re right! You could be! And now’s the time.</span></p>
<p><b>RK: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">You need leadership in two respects. So look what happened in January 2017: We had these massive women’s marches, which in turn led to massive organizing, which in turn led the Democrats to take back 41 net seats in the House in the 2018 midterms. So you need that kind of leadership and mobilization to keep Republicans from blowing away Democrats in the midterms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But you also need that leadership and mobilization to push the Democratic Party and to push Democratic candidates to be better economic progressives, because that’s what it’s going to take to win back disaffected working class voters. And you know, when you hear the word “working class,” you think of some guy working in a steel mill. I mean, today’s working class is the service economy. Its warehouse workers and its people working in fast food. And those people are just as oppressed as factory workers were when the CIO organized them with Roosevelt’s help in the 1930s. And Democrats need to stand up for the entire working class, which is most people, because most people are downwardly mobile. And they have to see the Democrats as their champion as they did during the heyday of the New Deal party.</span></p>
<p><b>JS:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Yes. And I would just like to, to end this if this is okay, by myself reading a passage from the end of your book, which I think speaks to all of this. You say: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To say that all of this is a long-term project is the mother of understatements. A good shorthand for what we’re trying to recover is the Enlightenment, the ancient arguments of reason versus blind faith. But we’ve learned from our brush with fascism, that history does not move in one direction. Dark areas of regression can last for decades and even centuries. We need to invoke what is best in America and be smarter and more strategic than those who invoke the worst.”</span></p>
<p><b>RK: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah. Hey, that’s pretty good stuff. I hope people buy the book.</span></p>
<p><b>JS:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> [Laughs.] Yes. As I said before, I would make everybody in America get this book and read it. So thank you again for being here.</span></p>
<p><b>RK:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Thanks so much. Appreciate it.</span></p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Hundreds of protesters</u> marched toward the Supreme Court in Washington on Thursday morning to send a message to President Joe Biden: He is not doing enough.</p>
<p>Demonstrators minced no words when it came to the five justices who had voted to overturn Roe v. Wade and issued sharp criticisms of a Republican Party that spent years securing a majority on the court extreme enough to reverse 50 years of precedent. Yet the anger that got many of the activists out on the street was aimed at the Democratic Party that many of the marchers hold partially responsible.</p>

<p>“The Democrats act as if the worst will never happen. And the worst keeps happening,” said Ana María Archila, a former candidate for lieutenant governor of New York, in an interview with The Intercept before the march. “They” — Republicans — “are rolling back decades of progress. They are taking away the most basic rights from people. Democrats have to have the courage to match the moment.”</p>

<p>Within a few hours, nearly 200 abortion activists had been arrested and forcibly removed from the crossing at First Street and Constitution Avenue in Washington, D.C. — a busy intersection near the court’s sprawling front steps. While sit-ins are a relatively common occurrence in Washington, organizers hope the size of the demonstration, and the broad coalition of organizations that supported the protest, inaugurates a renewed push for nonviolent civil disobedience in the wake of the Supreme Court’s gutting of abortion rights last week.</p>

<p>The demonstration, which was spearheaded by Center for Popular Democracy, saw a range of organizers, Democratic candidates, elected officials, and movement leaders from across the country assemble at the Lutheran Church of the Reformation on Capitol Street. The expected culmination of the day’s events — arrest at the hands of U.S. Capitol Police — was clear from the start.</p>
<p>The attendance of one organization in particular, Planned Parenthood Action, raised eyebrows. Unlike fellow supporting organizations like the Working Families Party, Planned Parenthood had never engaged in as urgent a form of direct action before Thursday.</p>

<p>The tactics represent a departure from what has defined many left-wing activist groups for most of Biden’s tenure. Despite the president’s sagging approval, many progressive leaders and legislators <a href="https://prospect.org/politics/how-joe-biden-defanged-the-left/">have chosen</a> to stand by his administration — or at least mute their criticisms — in exchange for increased access and a louder voice in the policy-making process. The administration’s failure to prepare a road map for a post-Roe America, however, appears to have soured that relationship.</p>
<p>Reports early Thursday morning that Biden had <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-unlikely-meet-bold-democrat-demands-after-abortion-ruling-sources-2022-06-29/">reversed course</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/30/filibuster-abortion-vote-exception-joe-biden">now supports</a> a filibuster carve out for abortion rights did little to convince attendees.</p>
<p>“They’ve had that draft opinion for how long?” said one protester, who asked that his name not be used, referring to a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/24/changes-alito-supreme-court-roe-draft-00031744">leaked draft</a> from the court made public in May. “And it still took them a week to say they support a filibuster carveout?”</p>

<p>A number of Democratic candidates who attended the event and faced arrest by Capitol Police shared that sentiment, including Melanie D’Arrigo, a candidate for Congress in New York’s 3rd Congressional District. A spokesperson for the D’Arrigo campaign, David Guirgis, told The Intercept that D’Arrigo’s arrest serves as proof that she was unafraid to push the party to take a firm stand on abortion rights. “We are here because Republicans have attacked Roe for 50 years and Democrats have done nothing,” he said. “[Melanie] is not afraid to stand up to Republicans or Democrats to ensure that basic human rights are protected.”</p>

<p>D’Arrigo was discharged from police custody within a few hours of being detained. Upon release, she issued <a href="https://twitter.com/darrigomelanie/status/1542586649598693378?s=21&amp;t=1rPIEIN_4zyb-loBhHoV5w">a statement</a> with a similarly defiant tone. “I was let go after a couple of hours—but for millions of people in states where abortion, a critical healthcare procedure, is now criminalized, their arrests will be far longer and far more severe,” she said. “What the Supreme Court did with their radical, partisan decision in Dobbs v. Jackson … underscores the need to elect better Democrats, not the status quo that got us here.”</p>
<p>One of the last activists to face arrest, legendary movement leader Rev. William J. Barber II of the Poor People’s Campaign put the message activists are hoping to send to elected Democrats in even starker terms. Arrested while addressing the crowd, Barber was being escorted away from the intersection by Capitol Police when he declared: “We will primary everybody.”</p>

<u>This is it.</u> The moment for President Joe Biden and Congress to challenge the underlying legitimacy of the U.S. Supreme Court and advance an aggressive climate action agenda. There will be no better moment to take this stand for a transformed court, nor a more fateful one. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/aoc/status/1542509947350446080">right</a>: “We need to reform or do away with the whole thing, for the sake of the planet.”</p>

<p>History contains crossroads when a single set of decisions can alter the trajectory of a people — or even a planet. The Biden administration’s response to the Supreme Court’s 6-3 EPA ruling, hot on the heels of the other outrageous power grabs, is a moment like that. No juncture offers greater opportunity for courageous, transformational leadership, should such a thing be on offer anywhere in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Biden came to office promising an “all of government” approach to the climate crisis. It was a defining issue in the Democratic Party primaries and a winning issue for Biden in the general election. Why? Because voters are now fully engaged with the climate crisis — and they reliably are most engaged in the summer, when our <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/07/23/stuck-in-the-smoke-as-billionaires-blast-off/">warming world speaks loudest</a>. But last fall, Biden let Sen. Joe Manchin push climate action <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/10/22/manchin-climate-fossil-fuel-subsidies-reconciliation/">way down his political agenda</a> — and suddenly we stopped hearing much about it at all. I suppose the smartest guys in the room thought it was starting to smell like defeat. Thanks to great advice like that, Biden managed to demoralize much of his base, and some of his best appointees <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/13012022/amid-delayed-action-and-white-house-staff-resignations-activists-wonder-whats-next-for-bidens-environmental-agenda/">resigned</a>.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[3] -->
<p>With the court’s EPA ruling, Biden now has a chance to put climate back at the top of the agenda. He should seize it. As Justice Elena Kagan wrote in the dissent, “The court appoints itself — instead of Congress or the expert agency — the decision maker on climate policy.” she wrote. “I cannot think of many things more frightening.” A great many voters, if the stakes are clearly explained and kept top of mind through consistent messaging, will agree.</p>
<p>In fact, no issue gives the Democrats a platform for a more powerful or more unifying message than this Supreme Court ruling — both to radically reform the court and to communicate the dire urgency of the climate crisis and the need for bold policy. Moreover, by using the court’s EPA ruling to finally do more than <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/roe-v-wade-overturn-democrats-anger-b2109987.html">send out</a> opportunistic fundraising emails — and instead to draw the line and move to transform an obviously out-of-control, extremist court — Biden and the Democrats would be doing precisely what they have never done and what young climate activists have been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0LtCRWkZXo">pleading</a> with them to do for years: Treat the climate emergency like an emergency.</p>
<p>The first rule of an emergency is that you do what it takes to end the emergency and get to safety. You don’t throw up your hands because the task is too hard. You certainly don’t let a gang of unelected, lifetime appointed political operatives — several of whom only have their seats because of trickery and lies — get in your way.</p>
<p class="p1"><!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[4](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[4] -->The first rule of an emergency is that you do what it takes to end the emergency and get to safety.<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[4] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[4] --></p>
<p>The Democrats&#8217; base would take tremendous heart from seeing this kind of emergency footing response, but it would be most meaningful for young people, many of whom can vote. And those voices should not be discounted. This extremist court has positioned itself as an advocate for youth, children, and the unborn — from abortion to school prayer. Its willingness to light the future on fire for all kids alive today and yet to come puts the lie to this absurd claim. If the Democrats turn the EPA decision into a pivot point, not just for speeches and poems and yoga poses but for decisive action in defense of the future, it would upend the debate.</p>
<p>They should, moreover, connect the dots between the individual rulings and their underlying logic. For several of these justices, their casualness about climate apocalypse is inextricable from their Christian fundamentalist takes on abortion and prayer (and soon, given the chance, gay marriage and trans rights). They aren’t worried about the world burning because they think we are in the End Times and that their faith will protect them (and failing that, that their wealth and their guns will, which is the way Republicans enact the Rapture without divine intervention). Biden should get biblical on these theocrats and call them on flouting the duty to care for all of creation.</p>
<p>The rolling judicial coup coming from this court is by no means over. Next term, the Supreme Court will hear a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/30/1107648753/supreme-court-north-carolina-redistricting-independent-state-legislature-theory">redistricting case</a> that could well make it far easier to concoct a legal pretense for overriding the popular vote in elections in favor of state-appointed electors — the very thing that Donald Trump attempted but failed to do, because enough people were afraid of ending up in jail. There is no reason to believe that a group of people whose very presence on the bench required grotesque abuses of democracy would somehow draw the line at thwarting it. The moment to stop them from getting the chance is right now.</p>
<p>Biden and the Democrats are currently careening toward a wave of defeats. But it’s not too late to get back on track. They have just been handed a winning platform: Use the Supreme Court’s attack on urgent carbon control as a catalyst to build a more meaningful democracy and take transformational climate action at the same time. If they decide to run with it, everybody on this planet wins. If they refuse, they deserve every loss coming their way.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Today’s 6-3 Supreme Court</u> <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-1530_n758.pdf">decision</a> restricting the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate carbon emissions will benefit power plants and fossil fuel companies throughout the U.S. and profoundly hobble the government’s ability to address the worsening climate catastrophe.</p>
<p>The decision, written by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and joined by conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh, finds that the EPA does not have the authority to impose caps on carbon emissions by mandating a shift to cleaner energy sources. The ruling means that Congress, rather than the EPA and its staff of scientific experts, will handle the critical task of curbing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, the Court strips the EPA of the power Congress gave it to respond to ‘the most pressing environmental challenge of our time,’” Justice Elena Kagan wrote in a dissenting opinion joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer. “Whatever else this Court may know about, it does not have a clue about how to address climate change. Yet the Court today prevents congressionally authorized agency action to curb power plants’ carbon dioxide emissions. The Court appoints itself—instead of Congress or the expert agency—the decisionmaker on climate policy. I cannot think of many things more frightening.”</p>
<p>A number of energy magnates and fossil fuel trade groups pushed for the case that could kneecap the agency and boost their profits. But perhaps no one did more to bring West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency to the Supreme Court — or ensure that ultraconservative justices would be on the bench to decide in the companies’ favor — than Charles Koch.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>The billionaire energy executive who reigns over Koch Industries is known for playing the long game. He bought up pipelines in advance of the fracking boom — and waited calmly until they delivered billions in profits. He invested in obscure, failing companies even though he knew that it would take years before they could add to his bottom line. And he has been cautious as he&#8217;s ventured into new markets — his empire now includes glass, pulp and paper, chemicals, agricultural products, and commodities trading — making small acquisitions to see if they’d be profitable before gradually taking over.</p>
<p>Such patience and strategic use of his enormous wealth have benefited Koch handsomely. His net worth has steadily climbed to more than <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/charles-koch/?sh=d1ea63d57d70">$60 billion</a>. Koch Industries, which makes more than half of its money from fossil fuels and owns refineries, petrochemical plants, and thousands of miles of oil and gas pipelines, is now the second-biggest privately held company in the country.<br />

<h2>The Kochtopus</h2>
<p>To ensure further growth of his riches even as science showed that the continued use of fossil fuels would accelerate <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/resources/spm-headline-statements">climate disaster</a>, Koch has funneled some of his vast fortune into an extraordinary network of political front groups, lobbying efforts, think tanks, and activist networks that aim to stifle climate action. For decades, the <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/11/history-of-koch-brothers-donation-network-money/">Kochtopus</a>, as some call his many-tentacled political influence machine, has sought to undermine not just the environmental regulation in Koch Industries’ path but also the science and philosophy of government on which it is based.</p>
<p>Koch’s lobbyists and political operatives helped kill a 2009 bill aimed at tackling climate change through a cap-and-trade system that could have cut into his companies’ profits. While the mounting findings of climate scientists led other titans of industry to begin adjusting their business plans to lower carbon emissions, Koch-funded groups were among the first <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/fighting-climate-chaos/climate-deniers/koch-industries/">climate denialists</a>, flatly lying about the well-documented planetary trend of <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature">global warming</a> and then schooling lawmakers on the alternate reality they had crafted. Koch also pioneered the attack on Republicans from the right, pushing the party into its current extremism.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[2](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A3%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="3"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[2] -->
<p>Today’s Supreme Court decision marks perhaps the biggest payoff yet for Koch’s decades of plotting against environmental regulations — and the most devastating loss for everyone else. Three of the extremist judges who joined the decision — Gorsuch, Barrett, and Kavanaugh — wound up on the Supreme Court in large part because of Koch’s activism and contributions.</p>
<p>Americans for Prosperity, an astroturf political group founded by Charles Koch and his brother David, conducted extraordinary campaigns to put all three judges on the highest bench. To support Kavanaugh’s nomination, the group reached out to more than <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22074549-afp_scotus_bythenumbers_830">1.2 million Americans</a> through mail, phone calls, and knocking on doors, according to a flyer released by the organization. The group also <a href="https://americansforprosperity.org/afp-mounts-full-scale-campaign-to-confirm-judge-amy-coney-barrett/">pushed hard</a> for Barrett, whose <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/amy-coney-barrett-oil-lobby-climate_n_5f905f09c5b62333b2413aa6">father worked</a> for Shell and the American Petroleum Institute, a powerful trade group for the oil and gas industry. And it campaigned for <a href="https://americansforprosperity.org/afp-key-vote-yes-on-the-nomination-of-judge-neil-gorsuch-for-associate-justice-of-the-u-s-supreme-court/">Gorsuch</a>, whose mother presided — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/02/01/neil-gorsuchs-mother-once-ran-the-epa-it-was-a-disaster/">disastrously</a> — over the EPA under President Ronald Reagan. Charles Koch is also closely connected to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/leonard-leo-federalists-society-courts/">Leonard Leo</a>, co-chair of the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/05/10/roe-v-wade-federalist-society-religious-right/">Federalist Society</a>, a conservative organization Koch has supported directly and through his family foundation.</p>
<p>The case itself can also be tied directly to Koch. The challengers are 27 Republican attorneys general, who were supported by the Koch-funded Republican Attorneys General Association. At least four Koch-funded entities have filed amicus briefs in the case: the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1530/205351/20211216122320892_WV%20v%20EPA%20merits.pdf">Cato Institute</a>, which was co-founded by Charles Koch; the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1530/205559/20211217145954348_West%20Virginia%20v.%20EPA%20final.pdf">Competitive Enterprise Institute</a>; the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1530/205814/20220105140643234_20-1530%20Amicus%20NCLA%20Supp.%20Petitioners%20REVISED.pdf">New Civil Liberties Alliance</a>; and <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1530/205710/20211220122257878_2021.12.20.AFPF%20Amicus%20Br.WV%20v.%20EPA%20et%20al.No.20%201530.Vide%2020%201531.20%201778.20%201780.pdf">Americans for Prosperity</a>.

<h2>Taking Aim at the EPA</h2>
<p>Koch’s antipathy for the EPA began with the founding of the agency in 1970. “It is the one regulatory agency that is on his ass every single day and has authority over all his operations,” said Christopher Leonard, author of “<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Kochland/Christopher-Leonard/9781476775395">Kochland</a>,” a history of Koch Industries and its political activities. “Every single day this agency is like a traffic cop clocking Koch’s speed on the highway. The EPA is sending agents to inspect Koch’s facilities. The EPA is monitoring the level of pollution coming out of spillways from Koch facilities. Koch has to employ almost buildings full of lawyers just to document their air emissions every year from their refineries, from their natural gas plants, from the Georgia-Pacific plant.”</p>
<p>The original case was about the Clean Power Plan, the Obama administration’s effort to limit carbon emissions from power plants, which are the second-largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. But that plan no longer exists, having been struck down by the Trump administration. Nor does its Trump-era replacement. In practical terms, the ruling will hamstring the Biden administration, which has pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions 50 percent economywide by 2030. The administration is in the process of crafting its own rule affecting power plant emissions, which is expected next year.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[4](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[4] -->
<p>“The decision takes off the table the approach that was used in the Clean Power Plan, the most efficient, effective way to address these emissions,” said Kirti Datla, director of strategic legal advocacy at Earthjustice. While the Biden administration will still be able to take less sweeping steps to limit carbon, such as requiring emissions controls on individual power plants, “this makes their job much harder,” Datla said.</p>
<p>Now Congress, rather than the EPA’s environmental experts, will be responsible for drafting the highly technical plan for limiting emissions from power plants. The regulatory process is expected to be far slower and less effective, which, according to Lisa Graves, executive director of True North Research, was exactly the point of the suit.</p>
<p>“These politicians in black robes know full well that, with Mitch McConnell in a leadership position doing the bidding of Koch and the oil and gas industry, this Congress will not pass any substantial climate change mitigation legislation,” said Graves, adding that the timing of the decision couldn’t be worse. “Now and in the coming years are the only window we have to really stem the tide of the truly devastating climate changes that are underway.”</p>
<h2>Broader Implications</h2>
<p>The motivations for the West Virginia case go beyond the individual and corporate pursuit of financial gain. “They&#8217;re doing it to make more money. But it&#8217;s also bigger in the sense they want to cripple the federal government,” said Leonard.</p>
<p>Indeed, the effects of the ruling will likely far surpass the EPA&#8217;s ability to limit carbon emissions from power plants. “It&#8217;s going to trim back the sets of regulations that they even consider,” said Leonard. “It&#8217;s a slow pushback of the EPA and a diminishment of its power over time.”</p>
<p>The West Virginia decision will also likely chasten other federal agencies, according to Datla. &#8220;It sends a signal to agencies that if they&#8217;re approaching big problems for the first time under their statutory authority, or if they&#8217;re tackling an existing problem, but using kind of a new approach, that either the court is going to be skeptical, or at the very least, somebody is going to bring a challenge based on all of the language that is in this opinion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ironically, the decision that weakens the federal government follows on the heels of <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/06/24/roe-wade-overturned-supreme-court-14th-amendment/">Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</a>, the ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade and vastly extended the reach of the state to control what people can do with their bodies. That decision, too, grew out of seeds that Charles Koch planted years ago. But the profound step backward for reproductive freedom seems to have been an incidental result of the billionaire’s effort to grow his fortune.</p>
<p>One of Koch’s most effective policy creations is the American Legislative Exchange Council, a right-wing activist network that drafts model state legislation, which is then introduced around the country. “Koch funded ALEC to do stuff like deregulate the utilities industry,” said Leonard. “But what animated ALEC was anti-abortion laws.” Indeed, the grassroots network Koch created <a href="https://alec.org/press-release/supreme-court-returns-abortion-decision-to-the-people/">took up the issue</a> even as he himself was indifferent about it.</p>
<p>“Koch doesn&#8217;t care at all about Roe v. Wade. Religious and cultural issues have zero relevance to him,” said Leonard, who added that Koch saw the abortion issue as a “sideshow.”</p>
<p>In contrast, Koch cares profoundly about West Virginia v. EPA. “This decision represents the culmination of years of attacks by Koch-funded groups on these rules,” Graves said. “It is a win for Charles Koch and the multibillion-dollar oil and gas industry and a huge loss for the American people.”</p>

Wilfried Bleriot, 32, was killed in action, according to Ukraine’s <a href="https://fightforua.org/">International Legion</a> in a Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ukr.international.legion/posts/pfbid0YVj1nYiKAB4kSNdJtw4eSK4a2NNLGMBmAeE5tELGQ7YJkwphE8bu7r7B3hkKFgZEl">post</a> on June 4, 2022.

<p>The Misanthropic Division’s violent, hate-filled Telegram channel was the first to announce Bleriot’s death, one day earlier, on June 3. The post said that he died on June 1 in Kharkiv and included a photo in which the thin and bearded Bleriot wears a T-shirt that says “Misanthropic Division” across the front.</p>

<p>In 2018, the Los Angeles Times <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-ukraine-neo-nazis-20180625-story.html">described</a> the Misanthropic Division as “one of many neo-Nazi groups that have mushroomed throughout Ukraine in recent years.” In 2020, the Daily Beast <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/far-right-terrorists-want-syria-crisis-to-bring-on-race-war">characterized</a> it as “the militant foreign volunteer wing of Ukraine’s neo-Nazi Azov Battalion.” The Guardian, in 2014, also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/02/neo-nazi-groups-recruit-britons-to-fight-in-ukraine">said</a> that the Misanthropic Division “is linked to the Azov battalion.” There are few other mentions of it in the news archive.</p>

<p>Bleriot was a “man who fought bolshevism and antifascism all his life,” according to the Telegram post, a “brother-in-arms,” who died defending Europe and Ukraine from “Asiatic hordes.” Among members of the group chat, Bleriot has become a martyr, a fallen comrade to be mourned and celebrated. One meme shows a Black Sun wheel — an icon of Nazi occultism — behind his smiling face.</p>
<p>Bleriot was from Bayeux, a town in the north of France. In an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/t5velr/im_ready_to_die_a_french_man_willing_to_fight_in/">interview</a> with an Argentinian reporter, uploaded to Reddit on March 3, he identifies himself as a Norman, says that he is “ready to kill Russians,” and “ready to die.” He adds that he left behind two children at home, and starts to cry. Bleriot’s family could not be reached for comment. Efforts to reach French authorities for comment on whether Bleriot was known to them were also unsuccessful.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Azov Battalion, which began around 2014 as a far-right street gang and has since evolved into a professional special operations regiment of the Ukrainian army, did not immediately respond to an inquiry about Bleriot and the Misanthropic Division. But back in April, I met with Andriy Biletsky, the founder of the Azov movement, at their base in Kyiv. I had not heard of the Misanthropic Division then, but I did ask Biletsky about foreign fighters. “We have volunteers from different countries,” he told me. “We’ve had Europeans, Japanese, people from the Middle East.” He also mentioned Belarusian, Georgian, Russian, Croat, and British volunteers. He pointed out that some of them had been Jews. However, “I can assure you that there are no Americans,” he said. “Not even western Europeans for that matter,” he added, slightly contradicting himself.</p>
<p>The Azov base, in the semi-industrial outskirts of Kyiv, was in an abandoned Soviet factory compound. Inside the main building, a yellow flag with Azov’s notorious Wolfsangel symbol in the center hung from the rafters. In two places, there were Black Sun clocks on the walls; such sun wheels, or <em>Sonnenrads</em>, also found on the floor of Heinrich Himmler’s castle in Germany, are widely used by contemporary adherents of Nazi ideology to signal their Aryan supremacist beliefs. Azov apologists say that they are merely indigenous Ukrainian symbols that must be understood in an Eastern European context. In any case, the sun wheels, backlit by blue neon, certainly lent the Azov base a neo-Nazi aesthetic. There were soldiers in full battle gear walking around, looking as squared-away and intimidating as any in Ukraine, and two women who worked as secretaries. The ground floor was full of new recruits, exclusively young white men, speaking Ukrainian and Russian.</p>

Two people were killed in another round of intense shelling between Western-backed Ukrainian government's forces and pro-Russian fighters in the separatist east, officials from both sides said. Ukraine's military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said one soldier was killed and six wounded in the past 24 hours of fighting across the mostly Russian-speaking war zone.

<p>Since Azov formed about eight years ago, it has attracted relentless controversy for its quasi-fascist ideology, unapologetically espoused by Biletsky, and alleged abuses against the few minority groups that exist in Ukraine, including the Roma. There is plenty of photographic evidence of Azov fighters displaying Nazi symbols on the battlefield (often with the intent to troll Russia). Azov has tried to clean up its image in recent years and present itself as depoliticized, and it is now an official component of the Ukrainian military, not an independent militia. But it has far more autonomy than any other regiment of the army. It presents itself as an elite corps and has attained an extraordinary degree of prestige and admiration in the eyes of ordinary Ukrainians for its stalwart defense of Mariupol, its home base, which finally fell to the Russians on May 20, following a dramatic, three-month-long siege. Although many hundreds of Azov soldiers were taken prisoner, many more young Ukrainian men have signed up to replace them.</p>
<p>“Azov is growing,” Maksym Zhorin, the commander of an Azov special operations unit in Kyiv, told me in April. “Our emphasis is on the future.” He added, “It might sound weird, but the actions of the Russian federation have been beneficial for us.”</p>
<p>As I noted in a recent piece for <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2022/07/searching-from-the-ukrainian-foreign-legion/">Harper’s</a>, when I left the base, I saw a small group of men hanging around outside the gate, and guessed from their appearance (paramilitary attire, neck tattoos, ball caps) that they were foreign volunteers. With several Azov soldiers standing next to my translator and me as we waited for a taxi, I didn’t think it wise to approach them, but I overheard them speaking English. The one phrase I caught distinctly, over the idling engine of an armored vehicle, was “foreign legion.” Also, who knows who was responsible for it, but “WHITE POWER” was spray-painted on the kiosk right in front of us, alongside the driveway — in English, no less.</p>

<p><u>Bleriot’s death,</u> the possible existence of more extremists like him among the ranks of Ukraine&#8217;s foreign fighters, and the rise of Azov as an internal military power should not be taken as representative of Ukraine’s society, government, and armed forces as a whole. Russian <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/02/25/putin-floods-airwaves-lies-zelensky-punctures-social-media/">propaganda</a> would have people <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/03/02/russian-tv-ukraine-war-conspiracy/">believe</a> that Ukraine and its military are full of neo-Nazis and completely under the sway of radical Russophobes. These falsehoods evaporate as soon as you set foot in the country. Ukraine does have a notably vigorous and aggressive ultranationalist sector, but even Azov, the most powerful and influential far-right force, remains a fringe movement. Ukraine is one of the biggest countries in Europe and contains multitudes. Its president is Jewish, a former TV comedian. Before Russia invaded, issues like corruption and economic stagnation were much bigger problems in the lives of ordinary people than the specter of roving gangs of fascist youths. If the Russians were really worried about neo-Nazi, ultranationalist, and white-supremacist militants, they would look in their own country, where such movements flourish as much as, if not more than, in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Likewise, Bleriot should not be taken as representative of the Ukrainian Army’s International Legion. Amid the chaos of the first two months of the war, most of the foreigners who flocked to Ukraine to fight were turned away and went home. The International Legion only accepted those with substantial military experience, mostly from the U.S. and U.K. Bleriot, who told an Argentinian interviewer that he had served one year in the French army, would have barely made the cut. There’s little doubt that he claimed the Misanthropic Division’s neo-Nazi ideology, as articulated in spaces like its Telegram channel, but such extremists, isolated and small in number, also <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/03/07/military-white-supremacy-extremism/">find their way</a> into the U.S. military on a regular basis.</p>
<p>As for the Misanthropic Division, it’s hard to tell how real it is, and how sizable. The extent of its actual association with the Azov Battalion is also unclear. Take Bleriot, for example. There’s no indication that he was with any Azov unit when he died in Kharkiv, in the northeast of Ukraine, far from Azov’s main areas of operation in the south. It may be that the Misanthropic Division is not a real-world unit with a leader and a chain of command so much as a twisted military clique that anyone online can claim.</p>
<p>Images readily available on the internet show young men from the U.K., France, Germany, Spain, Poland, Portugal, Brazil, and elsewhere displaying the group’s piratical-looking flag, often in conjunction with other hate symbols, and it’s possible to find photos and videos of Ukrainian soldiers, who appear to be engaged in actual combat, sporting its various badges, patches, and T-shirts. It could be a cohesive military unit made up of foreign volunteers, sheltered under the wing of the Azov Battalion, but I can find no convincing evidence, at the moment, that it is anything more than a toxic Telegram meme popularized by Azov’s most black-pilled fanboys, only a few of whom may really be serving in the unit.</p>

<p>The real question, when it comes to Ukraine’s foreign legion and some of the more distasteful characters that its international call-to-arms has attracted, is how much of a threat they pose to their countries of origin. The loosely organized International Legion, which may not have any central command, is limited in its ability to vet volunteers. Radical miscreants from all over the world who subscribe to the blood-and-soil ideology of neo-Nazi subcultures like the Misanthropic Division have a very real opportunity to travel to Ukraine, get military training, and participate in intense armed conflict against a technologically advanced enemy. If they survive, their combat experience could give them the confidence and ability to carry out acts of political violence in their home countries. This is clearly cause for concern at a time when incidents of hate crimes and domestic terrorism are on the rise.</p>

<p>In the same Facebook post of June 4 that announced Bleriot’s death, the International Legion also disclosed the death of Björn Benjamin Clavis, a German of unknown age. The photo of him shows a man who looks about 30 with buzzed hair in the uniform of Ukraine’s Territorial Defense Force. On the back of his right hand is an unmistakable tattoo of an Iron Cross, which the Anti-Defamation League describes as a “commonly-used hate symbol” favored by “neo-Nazis and other white supremacists.”</p>
<p>It’s possible that Clavis got the tattoo for innocuous reasons. It’s not that uncommon a symbol. The logo of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Truck_Company">Independent Truck</a> skateboard company, for example, looks a lot like an Iron Cross. So does the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marksmanship_badges_(United_States)#/media/File:United_States_Army_Marksmanship_Qualification_Badges.png">badge</a> given out for marksmanship in the U.S. Army. However, the ADL’s <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/hate-symbol/iron-cross">analysis</a> suggests that nonracist display of the Iron Cross mostly takes place in the United States. In Germany, where Clavis was from, it is very much associated with the Third Reich.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>For decades,</u> Sen. Joe Manchin has presided over West Virginia’s Democratic Party, crowning candidates and throwing cushy appointments to allies while the state’s jobs, wages, and environment have gradually been ground to dust. But earlier this month, a grassroots slate of over 50 Democrats took control of the West Virginia Democratic Party after winning a majority of seats on the executive committee and ousting party leadership, thus ending Manchin’s de facto control of the state party apparatus.</p>
<p>Now, after a six-year organizing push, every old guard party apparatchik — save for the treasurer — is out of office, replaced with activists from across the Democratic spectrum set on revitalizing the state and forcing renewed support from the national party. The June 18 victories mark the beginning of the end for an era defined by atrophy, nose-diving voter rolls, and just a single Democratic statewide representative: Manchin.</p>

<p>They did it by flipping the script on the Democratic Party. After Manchin and the Democratic National Committee used the bylaws governing unelected superdelegates to throw West Virginia’s 2016 presidential primary for Hillary Clinton — despite the fact that Sen. Bernie Sanders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/primaries/west-virginia">won every county</a> in the state — activists used the DNC’s own rules to unseat the base of one of its most powerful members. They sowed the seeds of power by demanding that the party make good on its rules governing gender and racial equity in its staffing as well as those governing free, fair, and timely leadership elections.</p>

<p>Republicans now hold the governor&#8217;s office, supermajorities in both houses of the West Virginia Legislature, and every statewide office save for Manchin’s. That&#8217;s thanks largely to the inaction of a state party that until recently was composed entirely of Manchin loyalists. There was outgoing state party Chair Belinda Biafore, who survived <a href="https://wchstv.com/news/local/efforts-to-oust-w-va-democratic-party-chairwoman-rejected">an attempted ousting</a> over her handling of state party diversity, and former Manchin chief of staff Larry Puccio, who notoriously switched <a href="https://wvmetronews.com/2020/11/15/w-va-super-lobbyist-puccio-crosses-political-streams-as-adviser-to-democrat-manchin-republican-justice/">political parties</a> after his departure. The recent upset offers hope that by populating the lower offices with Democrats who are committed to serving the public instead of favor-trading for personal gain, Manchin will no longer be the party&#8217;s only candidate who can run statewide and win.</p>
<p>The lack of Democratic support for one of the most impoverished and isolated regions of Appalachia culminated in a Republican takeover that started in the early 2000s and reached its peak with Donald Trump&#8217;s 2016 presidential victory. In the general election against Clinton, Trump emerged with nearly 70 percent of the Mountain State vote.</p>
<p>While Democrats treated West Virginia as a lost cause, the state and its party apparatus fell into disrepair at the hands of Manchin, who blamed his party’s statewide failures on progressive trends in the national party rather than his own lack of incentive to help anyone but himself and his allies.</p>
<p>The new slate of West Virginia Democrats is made up of a broad coalition of activists — including moderates — seeking to disrupt Manchin’s power. Unlike the Democratic Party <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/03/08/nevada-democratic-party-dsa/">upset in Nevada</a>, which saw the Democratic Socialists of America overthrow a calcified political machine with a vast progressive ground game, West Virginia’s insurgents pulled it off by outmaneuvering a decaying party leadership grown accustomed to uncontested elections — using the DNC’s own bylaws.</p>

<p>At the helm of the new executive committee is party Chair Mike Pushkin, a cab driver, musician, and member of the West Virginia House of Delegates. Pushkin is a cautious left-leaning liberal, one who tends to abstain from attacking Manchin head-on. Instead, he’s focused on rebuilding the party through the same bread-and-butter issues he pursued in the House of Delegates: job creation, addressing the opioid crisis, and allying with House libertarians to successfully pass a medical marijuana legalization bill.</p>
<p>In the vice chair position now sits Danielle Walker, a state delegate who appears to be the first person of color to sit on the executive committee in West Virginia history. Walker, an unabashed progressive, is the real triumph of the movement. After receiving Manchin’s endorsement for state delegate, she went on to blast the senator for his repeated attacks on Democratic priorities, like refusing to block the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and his <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/03/17/joe-manchin-viatris-mylan-union-heather-bresch/">failure to save the Mylan pharmaceutical plant</a> in her district.</p>
<p>“We won every officer seat we ran for,” said Shane Assadzandi, one of the organizers behind the new slate. “And after years of having to fight our own party to get a seat at the table, I look forward to fighting Republicans at the ballot box instead of useless Democrats at committee meetings.”</p>
<p>Some organizers first found each other amid the populist energy that emerged from Sanders&#8217;s clean sweep of the state during the 2016 primary, while other, more moderate members of the push joined up to remake a party that didn’t seem set on forwarding any candidates, moderate or otherwise. By enlisting, they realized that they could have an actual voice in the political process instead of serving as just one more set of pawns.</p>

<p><u>For years prior</u> to this month’s landslide victory, social worker-turned-organizer Selina Vickers battled the state party through the DNC’s adjudicative process, filing national challenges against the party’s violations of both state code and DNC bylaws. The dozen-odd members of party leadership are supposed to be elected by the 100-member executive committee, themselves elected by voters during midterm elections. But up until this year, that body served as a rubber stamp to approve the list of party leaders handed down by the incoming Democratic gubernatorial nominee.</p>
<p>“I started poring over all the rules that dictate this process and thinking about what was really going on here,” Vickers told The Intercept. “What I discovered was that they were electing the chair, the vice chair, and all their officers just months before the state convention in the presidential year without any real competition. … As soon as a new committee is elected during the midterms, it&#8217;s also supposed to elect its officers. Instead, they had developed a tactic of waiting to elect the slate dictated by the gubernatorial candidate to prevent grassroots groups from building power, and that&#8217;s what happened over and over and over again.”</p>
<p>Vickers began attending DNC meetings and taking notes on how power moved through the highest ranks of the Democratic Party. After years of going to meetings across multiple DNC committees, she submitted her research to the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee through what would eventually total nine challenges to the former regime&#8217;s operating procedures. These challenges included failure to hold timely elections, failure to announce committee meetings within the required time frame, failure to ensure committee diversity seats, and, critically, failure to make good on provisions stipulating requirements for gender parity in the overwhelmingly male state committee.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[4](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[4] -->“It’s about changing the party we have so that West Virginia has an actual chance. &#8230; It doesn’t matter if you&#8217;re a progressive or a moderate or an independent, there&#8217;s a seat at the table if we can unrig the system.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[4] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[4] -->
<p>In the summer of 2020, the DNC sent Vickers a memorandum acquiescing to a number of the challenges, laying the groundwork for this month’s upset. Between changes to committee elections catalyzing competitive races and newly enforced mandates on gender parity and diversity, organizers were equipped with procedural weapons to take on intransigent leadership.</p>
<p>Gender parity increased competition for executive committee seats, and making good on diversity and youth requirements helped clean out the overwhelmingly homogenous and aging old guard.</p>
<p>In a sardonic twist of fate, the new slate of West Virginia Democrats used the very bylaw code long scorned by progressives for entrenching the DNC’s power over free elections against its creator.</p>
<p>“I don’t love political parties, so I view what we did here as democratic with a small ‘D,’” Vickers said. “For me, it’s about changing the party we have so that West Virginia has an actual chance. You get pissed when you see people living in poverty in coal camps, people breathing in silica, all of this stuff directly related to policymakers in Charleston. It doesn’t matter if you&#8217;re a progressive or a moderate or an independent, there&#8217;s a seat at the table if we can unrig the system.”</p>
<p><u>During the upcoming</u> midterm elections, the new slate will focus on winning down-ballot races for offices like city council, county commission, state delegate, and eventually state Senate. Without a roster of candidates building trust, legitimacy, and fundraising networks at the local level, statewide offices remain out of reach. And while organizers will have to contend with Nick Casey, the singular Manchin holdover serving as party treasurer, he&#8217;ll be closely watched by the newly electeds dead set on change.</p>
<p>With the prospect of flipping West Virginia blue long off, the tactic of using DNC bylaws against old guard regimes may still prove replicable in other states like Massachusetts that are struggling under the weight of ineffective party leadership. As The Intercept <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/08/14/alex-morse-richie-neal-state-party/">reported</a> in 2020, Massachusetts’s party executives engineered a homophobic smear campaign to spike the candidacy of Alex Morse, a young mayor from Holyoke who attempted to overthrow one of the most conservative Democrats in the House.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges facing West Virginia, Walker is optimistic about Democrats&#8217; odds going forward. “I see Democrats around the state of West Virginia having hope for the first time,” she told The Intercept. “There’s a new beacon of light shining down on the government with people energized and ready to strategize with a return to the democratic process.”</p>
<p>“We are going to build livable jobs, safe jobs, sustainable jobs, sustainable housing, a public education system that will be respected, where educators, personnel, and students will all have a voice,” Walker said. “We don&#8217;t just want West Virginians to barely survive. We want them to thrive.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Coinbase, the largest</u> cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, is selling Immigrations and Customs Enforcement a suite of features used to track and identify cryptocurrency users, according to contract documents shared with The Intercept.</p>
<p>In August 2021, Coinbase sold a single analytics software license to ICE for $29,000, followed by a software purchase potentially <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akgmx4/coinbase-got-a-dollar136-million-contract-with-ice">worth $1.36 million the next month</a>, but details of exactly what capabilities would be offered to the agency&#8217;s <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2018/04/10/ice-raids-tennessee-meatpacking-plant/">controversial</a> Homeland Security Investigations division of were unclear. A <a href="https://techinquiry.org/FOIA/Coinbase-ICE-Analytics.pdf">new contract document obtained by Jack Poulson</a>, director of the watchdog group <a href="https://techinquiry.org/">Tech Inquiry</a>, and shared with The Intercept, shows ICE now has access to a variety of forensic features provided through Coinbase Tracer, the company’s intelligence-gathering tool (formerly known as Coinbase Analytics).</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[0] -->
<p>Coinbase Tracer allows clients, in both government and the private sector, to trace transactions through the blockchain, a distributed ledger of transactions integral to cryptocurrency use. While blockchain ledgers are typically public, the enormous volume of data stored therein can make following the money from spender to recipient beyond difficult, if not impossible, without the aid of software tools. Coinbase markets Tracer for use in both corporate compliance and law enforcement investigations, touting its ability to &#8220;investigate illicit activities including money laundering and terrorist financing&#8221; and &#8220;c<span class="cds-typographyResets-t1xhpuq2 cds-title4-ttr1998 cds-foreground-f1yzxzgu cds-transition-txjiwsi cds-start-s1muvu8a cds-3-_115h1mf">onnect [cryptocurrency] addresses to real world entities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>According to the document, released via a Freedom of Information Act request, ICE is now able to track transactions made through nearly a dozen different digital currencies, including Bitcoin, Ether, and Tether. Analytic features include “Multi-hop link Analysis for incoming and outgoing funds,” granting ICE insight into transfers of these currencies, as well as “Transaction demixing and shielded transaction analysis” aimed at thwarting methods some crypto users take to launder their funds or camouflage their transactions. The contract also provides, provocatively, “Historical geo tracking data,” though it’s unclear what exactly this data consists of or from where it’s sourced. An email released through the FOIA request shows that Coinbase didn’t require ICE to agree to an End User License Agreement, standard legalese that imposes limits on what a customer can do with software.</p>
<p>When asked about the ICE contract and the data involved, Coinbase spokesperson Natasha LaBranche directed The Intercept to a disclaimer on its <a href="http://Coinbase.com/compliance">website</a> stating &#8220;Coinbase Tracer sources its information from public sources and does not make use of Coinbase user data.&#8221; LaBranche did not answer questions about how ICE is using Coinbase Tracer, how it sources location data, or if the company imposed any limits on ICE&#8217;s use of the tool.</p>

<p>Coinbase has in recent years made a concerted effort to pitch its intelligence features to government agencies, including the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/16/irs-enlists-coinbase-in-latest-crypto-tracing-deal/">IRS</a>, <a href="https://decrypt.co/35312/coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-defends-contract-with-secret-service">Secret Service</a>, and <a href="https://decrypt.co/31461/coinbase-wants-to-identify-bitcoin-users-for-dea-irs">Drug Enforcement Administration</a>. Earlier this month, Coinbase vice president of global intelligence John Kothanek <a href="https://news.bloombergtax.com/e-discovery-and-legal-tech/criminals-using-crypto-are-easily-tracked-coinbase-tells-house">testified</a> before a congressional panel that his company was eager to aid the cause of Homeland Security. “If you are a cyber criminal and you’re using crypto, you’re going to have a bad day. … We are going to track you down and we’re going to find that finance and we are going to hopefully help the government seize that crypto.” Coinbase’s government work has proved highly controversial to many crypto fans, owing perhaps both to the long-running libertarian streak in that community and the fact that these currencies are so frequently used to facilitate various forms of fraud.</p>
<p>The Coinbase Tracer tool itself was birthed in controversy. In 2019, Motherboard reported that Neutrino, a blockchain-analysis firm the company acquired in order to create Coinbase Tracer, “was founded by three former employees of Hacking Team, a controversial Italian surveillance vendor that was caught several times selling spyware to governments with dubious human rights records, such as Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan.” Following public outcry, Coinbase <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvyndw/coinbase-says-ex-hacking-team-members-will-transition-out-after-users-protest">announced</a> these staffers would “transition out” of the company.</p>
<p>Homeland Security Investigations, the division of ICE that purchased the Coinbase tool, is tasked not only with immigration-related matters, aiding migrant raids and deportation operations, but broader transnational crimes as well, including various forms of financial offenses. &#8220;The contract provides a tool that supplements an HSI capability to investigative traffickers of deadly opioids on the dark web and cyber criminals who seek to attack critical infrastructure,&#8221; an ICE spokesperson wrote in a statement to The Intercept. &#8220;This tool does not reveal any sensitive personally identifiable information, is only referenced in criminal investigations, and it is not utilized in civil immigration enforcement.” The spokesperson did not respond to questions about how precisely it has used Tracer or might in the future, including the use of location data, noting &#8220;the agency does not provide specifics on investigative techniques, tools, and/or ongoing investigations or operations.&#8221;</p>

<p><u>When people shifted</u> to working from home in 2020, many renovated their homes to add offices. Influencers showed viewers how to easily install vinyl flooring from stores around the U.S., and sales of such flooring surged. But what these influencers didn’t know is that much of the vinyl flooring sold in the U.S. is made with PVC or plastic <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/06/14/china-uyghur-forced-labor-pvc-home-depot/">produced with forced Uyghur labor</a>. This week on Intercepted, Mara Hvistendahl, a senior reporter for The Intercept, breaks down the supply chain from the Chinese factories to U.S. stores. She is joined by researchers Laura Murphy and Nyrola Elimä, who recently wrote a report highlighting the working conditions in the factories, their grave environmental impact, and the human consequences for Uyghur people forced to work in the facilities.</p>
<p><b>MH:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> As the coronavirus pandemic spread through the world in 2020 and 2021, the shift to work-from-home ushered in a home renovation boom. Basement dens became offices, bathrooms got an overhaul, bedrooms were split in two. For their Covid home reboots, many Americans turned to a kind of cheap flooring that is commonly sold at DIY stores. And, as a Home Depot commercial explained, setting up vinyl flooring in your own home is very easy.</span></p>
<p><b>Home Depot commercial: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">[Upbeat music plays.] Vinyl flooring is a great option for just about every interior living space in your home. The flooring we’re installing today is Lifeproof Rigid Core vinyl plank flooring. Lifeproof is the latest innovation in vinyl flooring.</span></p>
<p><b>MH:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Vinyl flooring is seeing a surge of growth, boosted in part by pandemic-era renovations. The industry calls it luxury vinyl tile. But, in reality, it is layer upon layer of thin plastic, a heavily polluting concoction made with fossil fuels. And very often that plastic is produced using forced labor.</span></p>

<p><b>Jeremy Scahill:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> This is Intercepted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Upbeat music.]</span></p>
<p><b>MH:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> I’m Mara Hvistendahl, a senior reporter with The Intercept. I write about national security and technology. And, for the past few months, I’ve been investigating the connection between vinyl flooring in U.S. stores, these plastics’ devastating effect on the environment and the way these plastics are produced using forced labor practices in China. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It all starts in the Xinjiang region of Northwestern China. For years, the Chinese state has persecuted the predominantly Muslim Uyghur ethnic group there.</span></p>
<p><b>Becky Anderson (CNN): </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Not one, not some, but every single provision in the United Nations Genocide Convention violated by the Chinese government’s treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.</span></p>
<p><b>Reporter (The Economist):</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> These people are systematically oppressed by their own government.</span></p>
<p><b>Reporter:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> We’ve been waking up to horrific stories every day, heartbreaking images separating mothers from their children.</span></p>
<p><b>Reporter:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> They live in a police state where they’re monitored by one of the most advanced and intrusive surveillance systems in the world.</span></p>
<p><b>Samantha Simmonds (BBC):</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Documents seen by the BBC that are said to have been hacked from Chinese police computers show that Uyghur prisoners in the western region of Xinjiang are shot on site if they’re caught trying to escape.</span></p>
<p><b>MH:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Uyghurs have been systematically targeted by the Chinese state, made to labor in factories with harsh chemicals that not just pollute the environment, but place the workers’ own health at risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Xinjiang region is where the Zhongtai Chemical Company sits. That’s a Chinese government-owned petrochemical firm that is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of polyvinyl chloride, or PVC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">PVC is basically plastic. It’s a critical ingredient in the kind of vinyl flooring that is sold at Home Depot and other places you can buy home building products. A recent report from the nonprofit Center for Environmental Health found that in 2020 alone, the vinyl flooring that was shipped from China to the U.S. would cover over one million miles if laid out end to end. That’s long enough to stretch from Earth to the moon four times over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And a lot of the PVC for those floors comes from Zhongtai. The state-owned conglomerate’s four factories churn out more than two million tons of PVC resin per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And still more flooring made with Zhongtai PVC arrives in the United States via countries like Vietnam. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But here’s the problem: Zhongtai’s factories used forced Uyghur labor. By its account, Zhongtai has brought in thousands of Uyghur workers to toil in its facilities. And many of these workers were brought in during the pandemic when other factories in China were shut down. The workers toil in an environment saturated with coal, mercury, and PVC dust. They are exposed to respiratory hazards, neurological effects, and carcinogens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This sort of forced labor in Xinjiang is actually part of an overt government program. The Chinese government euphemistically calls this program “the labor transfer scheme” and claims it is aimed at lifting people out of poverty. But that claim is broadly disputed by human rights experts, scholars, and Uyghur survivors themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">None of this dark backstory is on display in the flooring section of a DIY store, of course. Instead, flooring products at a high risk of using Xinjiang PVC have whimsical names that make it sound as if they originated in a serene forest: Sundance Canyon Hickory, Maligne Valley Oak. Both of those styles are offerings in Home Depot’s LifeProof in-house flooring line. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I should note that Home Depot sent us a letter from one of the companies that supplies it with flooring. The letter says that the supplier’s supplier had informed it that no PVC from Xinjiang was used to produce flooring for the Home Depot. </span></p>
<p>The company also issued a statement that reads: “The Home Depot prohibits the use of forced or prison labor in its supply chain. This is an issue we take very seriously.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Low, droning music.]</span></p>
<p><b>MH: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">The toll taken by the flooring industry is detailed in a report recently released by researchers at Sheffield Hallam University’s Helena Kennedy Centre for International Justice in England and at the Maine-based, toxic chemical-investigative outfit Material Research. The report paints a devastating picture of oppression and pollution in the Uyghur region. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The report names Home Depot, among a number of other companies. Home Depot had this to say about it: “We will work to review the information in the report and to take any additional steps necessary to ensure that the product we sell is free from forced labor and fully compliant with all applicable regulations.”</span></p>
<p>I’m joined today by two of the report’s authors: Laura Murphy is a professor studying forced labor at Sheffield Hallam. And Nyrola Elimä is a researcher at Sheffield Hallam who is also herself Uyghur and grew up in the region.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And one side note for our listeners: We at The Intercept have covered the Chinese government’s repression of Uyghurs and other indigenous groups in a number of articles. </span><a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/04/22/oracle-digital-china-resellers-brokers-surveillance/"><span style="font-weight: 400">We have published stories about surveillance technologies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/01/29/china-uyghur-muslim-surveillance-police/"><span style="font-weight: 400">about a leaked police database</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, and </span><a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/07/20/video-surveillance-cameras-us-military-china-sanctions/"><span style="font-weight: 400">about the role played by American companies in the region</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/01/18/uyghurs-china-chamath-palihapitiya-warriors/"><span style="font-weight: 400">We have pushed back against corporate executives who downplayed oppression of Uyghurs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span><a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2018/08/13/china-muslims-uighur-detention/"><span style="font-weight: 400">And we have noted how China hitched its own campaign against Muslims onto to the War on Terror</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, and </span><a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/12/29/why-dont-we-care-about-chinas-uighur-muslims/"><span style="font-weight: 400">how there were Uyghurs who ended up detained at Guantanamo Bay.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> And we have discussed the topic </span><a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/podcasts/intercepted/"><span style="font-weight: 400">on this podcast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. But every time one of these articles or episodes comes out, we hear from people who ask why we’re covering this issue. They allege that the plight of Uyghurs is just a right-wing talking point. They say that it has become a tool of the American foreign policy elite amid rising tensions with China. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I began my conversation by asking Laura how she would respond to that critique:</span></p>
<p><b>Laura Murphy: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">I think that there are many different reasons that politicians and regular people come to this issue, not all of which are reasons I share with them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are people who are anti-China, there are people who are xenophobic, and those are not the reasons that we come to this. But I do think that this is not just a concern for the right. This is a concern for everyone. And in particular, for progressive people and other people on the left, we have to realize that this is the most significant human rights violation that we’ve seen in our time. We’re talking about upwards of a million people who are in internment camps, a massive surveillance state that is spreading across China and across the world, questions about privacy and rights that are up for debate because of what China has been able to do to the Uyghur people that has expanded the rights of governments to control their everyday of behaviors of people, especially minority people, and so concerns about minority rights, Indigenous rights, right to land right to work — these things that we care about are at stake right now because China’s getting away with doing it in the Uyghur region. </span></p>
<p>We care about it for the Uyghurs. And we care about it for the way it appears that China is looking to spread this across China and across the world. And I think that it’s right for us to think about genocide and other forms of exploitation, and abuse, and human rights violations that happen in the United States, or in Canada, or Australia to Indigenous people and the long legacy of slavery and its reach across generations in the United States, for instance, to think about how important it is that we don’t allow these things to happen in the world — in other places, or to encroach on other governments.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so I think that it’s completely fair to think: Well, let’s look internally and let’s look at what we’re doing in the United States to immigrants or to immigrant children, for instance. Let’s look at how we’re policing black lives. Those things are critical discussions. And I think that we are allies in these fights across the world to ensure the rights of Indigenous people, and people of color, and workers. And that these things need to be allied struggles rather than ones that we pit against each other.</span></p>
<p><b>MH:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Thanks. That was very well put.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And also there are often U.S. companies involved, right? Your team at Sheffield Hallam University has probably done more than any other group of researchers in the world to draw attention to this issue of forced labor in the Uyghur region. You’ve published reports on solar panels, on cotton, on the role of the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation. And often U.S. companies or U.S. investors are named in or are complicit in what’s happening in Xinjiang.</span></p>
<p><b>LM:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Absolutely, some of the biggest name investment firms, and the biggest multinational corporations, are sourcing from the Uyghur region, either directly or indirectly — and with impunity, until now. There has been nothing stopping most of these companies from using Uyghur-forced labor to make prices cheap. And there’s just such an enormous drive to make prices cheaper and to buy things at the lowest possible price that we actually, we feed into a system that allows — that, in fact encourages — a government like China’s to exploit the Uyghur people and to move industry out to the Uyghur region where they can use free labor, practically, and also cheap coal to produce goods that we are buying in the United States and companies know that this is going on. And they have, for years, looked away.</span></p>
<p><b>MH: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Right. Right. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, if I were an executive at a company that sources from China, and an email from one of you, or from someone on your team, showed up in my inbox, I would be very worried. </span></p>
<p><b>LM:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> [Laughs.]</span></p>
<p><b>MH: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">So you both have a personal connection to this issue. Can you talk a bit about how each of you got into this line of work?</span></p>
<p><b>LM: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Nyrola, why don’t you start?</span></p>
<p><b>Nyrola Elimä:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> My cousin was in a concentration camp. And now she’s in a prison. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before they put her in a prison, I think it was around 2019. At that time, I [didn’t know what forced labor was]. But I do know, transferring people to another place or to a factory against their will is wrong. And I know, grabbing land from Uyghur people or Indigenous people is wrong. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I started to look at something online then I found something. So I sent it to Rian Thum. And I guess that’s how Laura Murphy knows that I have the knowledge of this and I started to look at this. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So one day she approached me and she wants to see what we can do together. So that’s how we eventually ended up publishing three reports.</span></p>
<p><b>MH:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> And Rian Thum is Laura’s partner and a scholar of the region. </span></p>
<p><b>NE: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s correct. </span></p>
<p><b>MH: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">And I probably should have prefaced this by asking: I mean, you grew up in the Uyghur region and you are yourself Uyghur, and then left in what year? </span></p>
<p><b>NE:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> 2011. </span></p>
<p><b>MH:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> And then, since then, have had this horrible experience of seeing your parents put under house arrest, your cousin sent to prison for basically spurious charges, right? And then the growing repression around them in the region.</span></p>
<p><b>NE:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Yes, I left the region in 2011. And then, in 2017, after I obtained Swedish citizen[ship], I plan to go back to visit my parents with my, at-the-time, boyfriend. And then my mom wrote something on the paper that said: “Do not come back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, yeah, I never had a chance to go back to Xinjiang since 2011. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And since 2018, they detained my cousin, and then put my parents under house arrest in 2019. So basically, since 2017, or let’s say, basically since 2018, I’m living in hell.</span></p>
<p><b>MH:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Yeah. I’m so sorry. </span></p>
<p>Laura, could you talk about how you got into this issue, what your background is a bit?</p>
<p><b>LM:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Sure. I lived in Xinjiang for a short time, about a year in the early 2000s, and I’ve been back several times since then. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when the crisis in the Uyghur region first started to become apparent to us, at least, in 2017, and we started to hear about people disappearing, we became very concerned. People we knew were disappearing, and were not being able to communicate with their families. And we started to hear from more and more people in the Uyghur region that they were losing touch with their families or being told not to come home, just like the kind of story that Nyrola was just saying. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, for some time, I was concerned about this issue, and I was working however I could, putting things up on Twitter, helping to raise awareness. But then when it turned out that there was a massive system of forced labor, that’s where I kicked in. My research is on forced labor. And so I very quickly began to try to learn how to do the research methods that I have been employing for these, that my whole team has been employing for these projects, because my work has always been about worker voice and about survivor narratives and thinking about how people who are forced to work explain those situations themselves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And in this situation, we don’t have access to the workers, we have no capacity to get on the ground in Xinjiang and actually do worker voice interviews or talk to survivors of the camps or of the forced labor regime. And so we had to find other ways to understand what was going on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so what we do — and what Nyrola is a genius at — is just searching the internet for traces that companies and governments leave online, themselves, of the work that they’re doing. They write up explanations of their celebration of how they transformed people from being farmers to being workers — from not wanting to work in a factory to wanting to work in a factory — how they go door-to-door, day after day, to coerce people into leaving their homes, and families, and land, behind to go to work against their will. And so we use those methods, because we can’t talk directly to Uyghur who are working on the ground. And it’s terrible, but this is what we have. And so it’s what we’re using to better understand the situation.</span></p>
<p><b>MH:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Nyrola, could you talk a bit about the process of documenting those abuses? I mean, the Chinese government euphemistically calls this program the labor transfer scheme, when in fact, it is a mass forced labor effort. But where do workers in the scheme come from? And how are they transported to factories? And then what happens once they’re there?</span></p>
<p><b>NE: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">The Chinese government says — as you probably already see, or [have] heard — that all employment is voluntary, and how this poverty elevation program is doing good, how they lifted Uyghur people out of poverty, and the work transfer helps free rural families from poverty by giving them steady wages, skills, and how they train them in the Chinese language. But during my research, I have been seeing, like repeatedly, multiple times, that the Chinese media acknowledge that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Workers repeatedly claimed they don’t want to go. They have sick parents [they] need to take care [of], they have a newborn baby, they just married, or they have a family, or some of them already had a job or have a farm they need to plant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then when I document all of these government directives, companies, IPO documents or annual report or all of those state media, I saw that Uyghur workers usually they were standing at attention under the flag of China, and those new recruits/employees, they were undergo some training in management, sometimes Chinese culture or [that they are] antiquated — then train them how to love the party, love the country, and somehow, like weirdly, some loving the individual like Xi Jinping</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. And before this Uyghur worker [is] assigned to the work, they were giving some lectures on eradicating religious extremism, and trained them to become law-abiding workers, and who will embrace their Chinese nationhood. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I read this kind of news, or when I read the documents, you clearly see there is coercion behind this description. And you will see some of the really weird videos like Uyghur workers washing — let’s say their boss or their superiors — washing their feet. This is absolutely not an ordinary worker orientation. You do not ask someone else to wash your feet, right? And you do not force someone to love the country, love the party, then get a job. You do not force someone to leave their home, leave their wife, leave their husband, whatever, the kids — and coming here to work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So every time when I see these kinds of weird propaganda articles or government news or the annual report, I will just archive them and save them. And I know eventually I will use it.</span></p>
<p><b>MH: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah. I mean, you mentioned that many of these state media reports read as very weird. And I was also struck in the reports that you collected by the admission that workers often did not want to be at the factories, that they had left behind their ailing parents, their newborn baby, as you mentioned. And many listeners might find it odd that the state press would so carefully document what, to international observers, is clearly a gross violation of human rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So why did they carefully document these abuses? What’s going on with those state press reports?</span></p>
<p><b>NE: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">They believe what they’re doing is good. They don’t even realize they’re exploiting Uyghur people, and they believe this kind of program is indeed what will change Uyghur people’s mindsets. They believe Uyghur people have [a] radical mindset and they’re backward, and they believe this kind of poverty alleviation program, labor transfer program, indeed will change their mindset and change their thinking, turn them to become a better citizen. That’s why they’re carefully documenting these kinds of things. Not only for celebrating, but also [for companies] willing to show their loyalty to the Chinese government. You have this kind of program: Look how we did it!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And everyone is [competing with] each other. And, in fact, by participating in this kind of labor transfer program, they will actually get a reward from the Chinese government. So this is how they will document it, ever since. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I also see there&#8217;s [been] a big transfer since last year, after the Chinese government, Chinese companies realized Western [countries] were taking very seriously this kind of human rights abuse issue. They start to wipe up this kind of document in their annual report or IPO report. And sometimes they will delete everything they have published before.</span></p>
<p><b>LM: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">I just want to put a fine point on what Nyrola is saying here. And what we’re looking at is a massive, rampant racism that pervades discourse about Uyghurs across China. And companies have, for a long time, been resistant to operating in the Uyghur region because corporate executives hold extraordinarily racist ideas about Uyghur people, about what they’re capable of, about their work ethics, about their values, about their religion, and their practices, and their culture — and about women and what women believe and what women should have to believe, and how many children they should have. </span></p>
<p>I mean, it’s just extremely racist. And it has all of the contours of colonialism and colonial racism that we recognize from the rest of the world. It’s absolutely identifiable from everyday experience in the region. And it’s documented in academic studies, Chinese academic studies sponsored by the state that show that companies have resisted working in that region, or working with Uyghurs, or hiring Uyghurs. There are job descriptions that explicitly exclude ethnic minorities from anything that’s forward-facing, like customer-facing, like anything that’s administrative.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so companies moving out to the Uyghur region hold these beliefs to be true, and have taken up the responsibility of changing Uyghurs, transforming every aspect of their lives: in their homes, in the way they pray, in the way they eat, the way they talk, who they talk to, what language they speak, how their children are raised, how they plant their own fields, what crops they plant, what books they read — everything! Every tiny little aspect of life is being controlled by these companies at the behest of the central government. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And companies are sending their workers, their Han workers, into Uyghur homes to stay sometimes for weeks at a time even, to monitor, to surveil Uyghur people, and to ensure that they behave in a way that is deemed appropriate by the majority population that has colonized there. So these companies are part of a massive colonial enterprise that has infiltrated the entire life and culture of Uyghur life. Uyghurs are the dominant population of that region. But companies in collaboration with the government are doing the government’s work for the government, essentially — monitoring and controlling Uyghur people and Uyghur lives and Uyghur culture and Uyghur identities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And it’s all part of this bigger colonial project. And so when they celebrate, when they show that they’ve taken Muhammad away from his home, that they have put him into intensive labor, that they have made him a docile citizen who used to — in one story we saw, like say every single day that he wants to leave but now he’s working and is quiet and is no longer complaining. That’s a story that shows the government that they are playing their role in suppressing the Uyghur people. And that is what is happening in those documents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And Nyrola is right — you can see it in all these different little aspects of what they’re doing and what they’re claiming to be doing. But the overall mission is a colonial mission. And it’s a repressive mission. And it’s being enacted hand in hand between the government and companies. And, as you said before, U.S. companies, multinational corporations are complicit in this and they’re turning away.</span></p>
<p><b>MH:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Let’s talk about the report that you just came out with on forced labor in the vinyl flooring industry. That’s a product that many Americans have in their homes or in their offices, but that most people haven’t thought twice about. And yet, it’s literally underneath our feet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Can you talk about how you came to this particular topic? And why did you look at this specific company, in your report, Zhonghai Chemical Group?</span></p>
<p><b>LM: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Part of how we determine what we’re going to study is based on what the Chinese government has invested in the Uyghur region. They’ve invested in new energy development, they’ve invested in apparel manufacturing and cotton producing and processing in that region — in terms of cotton, that’s been for decades now. So we look at the things that the Chinese government has put the most emphasis on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But while we’re doing research, we are often just collecting other companies that we are not sure about, or that didn’t quite make it into the report, and we have profiles of tons of companies in our hard drives that we’re still trying to figure out what to do with. And so Nyrola, tell us about looking into Zhongtai before we even started thinking about PVC and then I’ll pick up how we ended up doing PVC.</span></p>
<p><b>NE: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">I know Zhongtai since 2019. But, at that time, I was not specifically looking at Zhongtai, I was looking at almost every company in Xinjiang. And then, at that time, I was looking at almost every industry, because I realized no matter which industry you look at in the Western world, somehow some Chinese company or Xinjiang company are involved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So Zhongthai was always on my radar, because every time I searched on the state-sponsored labor transfer program or poverty elevation program, I see Zhongthai’s name. And Zhongtai is there. This company [is] always there. So I always archive, save it; archive it, save it. </span></p>
<p>And then one day, after we finished this World Bank IFC report, and somehow Laura said: There’s a [indistinct word]. So she asked me to look at the PVC industry. Then I searched: Zhongtai. Yeah.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I said: Hey, we already have tons of documents of Zhongtai. So that’s how we started. </span></p>
<p><b>LM: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah. We had asked a group called Material Research to help us, just review our environmental analysis in the International Finance Corporation report that we did where we showed that International Finance Corporation, the development arm of the World Bank, had been investing in companies in the Uyghur region, and in fact, owned equity in one of them. And we were trying to understand their role there — not only in participating in forced labor, but also an environmental damage because we’re starting to see more and more that these companies are not just treating Uyghurs as a docile labor force; they’re treating Leaguers essentially as disposable in all aspects of their lives. So it doesn’t matter if they completely pollute the region or do horrible things to their farmland, or dispossess them of their land. The Uyghur people are essentially being treated as disposable. And so we wanted material research to review the environmental pieces because this was not our area of expertise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, when we did that, he said: Hey, OK, look, how about we trade? You help me understand Zhongtai, and I’ll help you understand this environmental stuff, because he’d been looking at PVC production and the environmental damage there, but he didn’t have access to information about forced labor. </span></p>
<p><b>MH:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> This is your co-author, Jim Vallete. </span></p>
<p><b>LM: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">So this is how Jim Valleet and Material Research teamed up with us, with me and Nyrola, to try to understand what’s going on in the flooring industry. And what we learned was that, in fact, Zhongthai and the seven total factories, four of which are owned by Zhongthai, that are creating PVC in the Uyghur region produced 10 percent of the world’s PVC. And so this was another industry that, in fact, the Chinese government had really invested in moving out to the Uyghur region, again to rely on all the labor there, and also to rely on the coal that’s so abundant in the Uyghur region. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So we were like: OK, let’s do this. Let’s make this report happen. And let’s collaborate.</span></p>
<p><b>MH: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">So yeah, let’s talk about the pollution. I mean, to me, one of the most tragic findings of the report, and there are many of them, but one of them is the intersection of racism with pollution and environmental damage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so I focused a bit on the consumer-facing end of the vinyl flooring industry. And the companies often promote it as environmentally friendly, which it is not, they even tout it as liberating for women. But in fact, it has this incredibly dirty production process. Can you talk about that process and how it intersects with the oppression of Uyghurs?</span></p>
<p><b>LM: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">So there are two primary ways that the production of PVC is harmful for the environment and harmful for workers. One is that it’s made using coal, which is extremely dirty, it has an enormous carbon footprint. And what material research and Jim Valett, our co-author, was able to do was to calculate the extraordinary carbon emissions that are produced in the production of PVC in the Uyghur region, because it’s one of the only places in the world where this one process is allowed to continue happening, a process that mixes coal and mercury to create PVC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so it has an enormously high carbon footprint. And it consumes more mercury than any other industry — and, in fact, it consumes some huge percentage of the mercury that’s produced in the world each year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And why this is important is that one, that mercury leeches into the places where it’s being produced; a ton of it is emitted into the air. In other places in the world where this process used to be used, including in my home state of Louisiana. Those places have been declared Superfund sites, and the factories have been closed. But the Chinese government allows this industry and many other extraordinarily polluting industries to move out to the Uyghur region, even as they’re shutting it down in other parts of China. Because, again, the Uyghur region is being treated as a dumping ground for whatever horrible things that the Chinese government has to do, or whatever projects for social control that they want to test out — they do these things in the Uyghur region. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so we saw stories where people were saying that all of their crops were dying as a result of one of these PVC plants moving in; that they were dying. This is really dangerous stuff. And where did they put it? They put it in the middle of farmland. And it is the desert, but there are farms within a kilometer or two of these plants.</span></p>
<p><b>MH: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah. And my understanding is while this process is highly polluting wherever it happens, it’s even more polluting the way it’s happening in Xinjiang because of the use of mercury and so forth.</span></p>
<p><b>LM: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s exactly right. And you’re right to say that this is a form of environmental racism. And, again, this goes back to why people on the left should care about this, because it really is a situation of environmental racism in a context of colonialism, where people are being treated as if their lives are not worth what everyone else’s lives are worth. And so I think it’s one of the most devastating things I’ve ever researched, honestly.</span></p>
<p><b>MH: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Zhongthai makes PVC at its factories, and then that PVC eventually ends up in the flooring that appears on the shelves of, for example, Home Depot and other big box stores in America. Can you talk about how it gets there and where it goes along the way? </span></p>
<p><b>LM: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">All of the PVC that Zhongthai manufacture, they manufacture in the Uyghur region. And then they ship it to two different places on the coast, at least — they probably ship it to many different places. But from our vantage point, we can only see what’s publicly documented. So we’re able to see them shipping it to their own subsidiaries in Hong Kong. They have an import-export business registered there. This is how a lot of companies are moving their goods from the Uyghur region out to the coast. </span></p>
<p>And then they also sell it to another company unrelated to them called Zhejiang Tianzhen. Zhongtai is the second biggest supplier of PVC to Zhejiang Tianzhen. And then, from the coast, from those two companies, the PVC gets sent to a Chinese-owned company, a company owned by Zhejiang Tianzhen itself, called Jufeng New Materials in Vietnam.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So this company that is ostensibly a Vietnamese company where they manufacture the PVC into flooring tiles, that company is actually Chinese-owned, and it’s actually receiving tons of its PVC from Xinjiang, though not directly. And this is what we’re seeing more and more. </span></p>
<p>It used to be that you could see a lot of shipments coming out of the Uyghur region. You could see it in shipping records. They would ship directly to the United States, in fact, from Xinjiang. In the last four years, that has declined precipitously as people have become more aware of the crisis in the Uyghur region.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so what’s happening now is that Xinjiang companies like Zhongtai ship to other companies or their own subsidiaries on the coast, and then to a second country, like Vietnam, or Cambodia, or India, where they manufacture the finished product, so that the packaging says “Made in Vietnam” or “Made in Cambodia.” And so, in this way, the China inputs and the Xinjiang inputs are obscured for the final consumer. They end up on the shelves of companies like Home Depot, and many, many, many of the other major flooring companies in the United States, through this intermediary, this Chinese company that is an intermediary in Vietnam. </span></p>
<p>This is happening more and more. We see companies setting up intermediary subsidiaries across Southeast Asia because this allows them to move things out of China and out to the rest of the world more easily.</p>
<p><b>MH: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah. And as you said, it’s not just Home Depot. I think your report named dozens of companies that receive flooring from this factory in Vietnam and from other intermediaries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And even if you go to a small contractor thinking: I’ll just get my flooring from an independent source — there’s a high likelihood that their flooring is also made with the PVC from the Uyghur region. So all of that shows how just very complex this issue is. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Your team, Lauren and Nyrola, was able to trace the flow of PVC from Xinjiang to the United States by carefully analyzing shipping records, by looking at these company reports and by state press reports, as you explained. But companies, when they’re confronted with this evidence, often say: Look, it’s really hard for us to carefully vet our supply chains; vinyl flooring passes through multiple companies, and it’s become harder for us to audit our factories in China for a number of reasons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And, Laura, you’ve basically told me that you think this is a weak defense and that companies can do a lot more. </span></p>
<p><b>LM:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> I do think that’s a really weak defense. And for two reasons: One, what we’re able to do is identify the risk of Xinjiang inputs going into the final piece of flooring. It’s possible that because not all of Jufeng&#8217;s PVC comes from Zhongtai as far as we can tell, that maybe this piece of flooring over here or this particular shipment over there was made with PVC that was not made in the Uyghur region. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there’s a lot more PVC being made in the Uyghur region that we can’t trace because it’s being obscured. And we’re underestimating how much PVC is going into this flooring to start with. But companies should be able to identify that risk the same way we do; they can look at the same documents. In fact, they have more evidence that they can collect; they have more power to get information than we do. And so they should be asking their suppliers precisely where every ounce of PVC is coming from to ensure that the raw materials that go into their products are not being mined or manufactured in the Uyghur region. If you’re selling things in the United States, that is now the law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the thing is that companies will say: Well, we’re getting stonewalled by our suppliers. They won’t tell us where they buy it from. And I say: Well, first of all, you can often find it in their own corporate annual reports. That’s how we do it. You can look at your customs records to see if they’re buying from that company. That’s how we do it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We’ve had tons of companies write to us and say: Oh, no, no, no, no. My supplier has told us that they stopped sourcing from x company two years ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I say: Well, here’s a spreadsheet of us customer records, that proves the opposite. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And it takes me two minutes to find that information, right? And they’re just going on the word of their suppliers, written attestations saying: We abhor forced labor — which, of course, everyone says they abhor forced labor. The attestations that say: We have a policy — well, of course you have a policy. That doesn’t mean you actually even know what forced labor is. I think a lot of these companies in China don’t believe that what’s happening in the Uyghur region is forced labor, and have a completely different definition of that because again, of this racism and colonialism that I’ve been talking about. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then they get told by the companies: Oh, we can’t find out or we won’t find out for you where our goods are coming from. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And they continue to source from those companies. And it seems to me that if a company goes to a supplier and the supplier says: I can’t or won’t tell you where the inputs come from, then you have to find a new supplier. And especially now that the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act went into effect last week, and the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act bans any U.S. company from importing goods that were made in whole or in part in the Uyghur region. That’s raw materials, rocks, cotton, anything that can be mined or grown, anything that can be manufactured in that region, is banned from import. It’s critical that companies do that research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But they keep saying: Oh, well, we’re getting stonewalled — and their response is that the government should change the law, not that they should change their suppliers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They need to change their suppliers. And it is going to mean some slowing of supply chains, it is going to mean some pretty radical shifts. But it also means the increase in productivity and capacity of companies around the world to produce things outside of a place where there’s the most egregious human rights violations going on, and where most of the manufacturing is being based on coal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So this is good in general anyway, for the expanded capacity for manufacturing to happen across the world. This is a way of getting out of being held captive when China decides they’re going to do something horrible to people or they’re going to capitalize on exploitation.</span></p>
<p><b>LM:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Right. I mean, so you mentioned that companies will often say: Well, we’ve gone to our suppliers and they say everything’s fine. I mean, in the process of writing about your report, and doing my own research, I went to Home Depot to ask them about a flooring line called Lifeproof in which some of the styles, some of the Lifeproof styles have a high likelihood of being made with PVC from Zhongtai, as your report showed. And they sent me a letter from their immediate supplier, claiming that the parent company of the Vietnamese factory you talked about had assured them that it was not using PVC from Xinjiang to produce flooring for Home Depot, and so: case closed. [Laughs.] But that is clearly not sufficient, you’re saying. </span></p>
<p><b>LM:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> It’s not only not sufficient. It’s just untrue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean we saw Home Depot say: Well, we got attestations that they were not sourcing from Zhongthai since June 24. And it took me two minutes to look at customs records to see that that was not true.</span></p>
<p><b>NE: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">As a supply chain analyst, I acknowledge it is a bit tricky to trace this stuff, because the biggest problem is the complicity and opacity of the supply chains that run through China. But it’s tricky for us! It is not tricky for the companies.</span></p>
<p>You purchase stuff; you’re sourcing stuff; you should know where your stuff [is] coming from, and you have much more resources than us, because you are the one who talked to the supplier. Right? Not us. And I also understand that the products can pass through [many] layers, sometimes [many] layers of the companies, sometimes maybe in inland China or outside China. But again, company, you have the responsibility and you have the resources. You can ask your supplier. You can ask where they’re sourcing from.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The thing that amazes me is every single time after we publish a report, you always have some companies — big, big, big companies, big ones — come to us to ask: Could you please tell us what we can do? [Laughs.] I have to be honest. I always feel very amazed, like: I don’t have your resources, but we found it. </span></p>
<p><b>MH:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> [Laughs.]</span></p>
<p><b>NE: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">You have the resources. What are you doing? </span></p>
<p><b>MH:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> We found it using our internet connection. And some careful research skills.</span></p>
<p><b>NE: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes! They will pay tons of money to [a] consulting company to tell them: Oh, your supply chain is fine. But what they actually should [be] doing is paying the money to those who actually really focus on human rights issues, or those who actually do their job to find our problem in their supply chains. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, no, companies [are] just [like]: As long as I hide, good! As long as the law doesn&#8217;t come to me; as long as there is no report [to] expose us, we’re fine. And then when we greenwash or when we do PR, we always say: Oh, forced labor is a horrible issue! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it’s just driving me crazy when I see how hypocritic[al] they are.</span></p>
<p><b>MH:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> And what about the role of consumers in all of this? What about people who are listening to this podcast, for example. It’s not sustainable to go rip up your vinyl floors, obviously. And people who are planning to install new floors can look for better alternatives. But what about the rest of us? What can consumers do about forced labor in the Uyghur region?</span></p>
<p><b>LM: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">I think companies need to know that consumers care. I think they believe that we don’t care and that all we care about is that we get goods that are as cheap as humanly possible. And I guess we should put it as: As cheap as inhumanely possible, right? [Laughs.] </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I do think that we should be looking for more sustainable companies. We shouldn’t be just believing when they say: Oh, well, we have this certification or that certification. These things have pretty much all been debunked as legitimate ways of determining if there&#8217;s forced labor in your supply chain. And most of them don’t even say that they’re identifying forced labor, most certifications aren’t doing that work. But we’ve come to believe that they are; that they’re protecting us. And they’re not protecting us from everything. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I think for me, and for a lot of people who are really invested in this issue and really invested in rights — and invested in the planet’s future — I think that buying more things used actually is a big thing that we can do, like really dedicate ourselves to being engaged in recycling and reusing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But when it comes down to it, consumers can’t trace everything that they buy, right? They can’t do what we do. It takes us a really long time to figure out what’s going on. And it takes some skills. And they shouldn’t be expected to. Government should be protecting consumers from being exposed to complicity enforced labor. Our governments need to be taking action to identify those goods and keep them from coming into the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The United States and Canada are the only countries that actually have laws on the books to say that we can’t import these kinds of goods — goods known to be made with forced labor! The EU is looking at a bill for it; I think EU citizens need to step up and say: Look, we want this bill. We expect that our government protects us from buying goods made with forced labor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because we can buy all the used things we want, but we do have to buy some things. If I want paprika, for instance, it’s likely coming from the Uyghur region. And yet, I can’t get used paprika. It’s hard to buy even a pair of headphones!</span></p>
<p><b>MH: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">You can’t get used tomatoes. </span></p>
<p><b>LM: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Right. You can’t get used tomato paste. And even headphones, like it’s hard to buy a pair of cheap used headphones, and it’s very difficult to find a pair that’s not made in China, and that you can really trace the provenance of. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And, again, consumers shouldn’t be responsible for this; companies should be responsible for this, for ensuring that they’re not using forced labor. And companies won’t do it voluntarily. We need government to tell companies that they must trace their supply chains all the way to the raw materials. I think most people believe that companies know that information. And they simply don’t. And it’s convenient for them not to know it. And it’s dangerous for us.</span></p>
<p><b>MH:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Then you mentioned the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which a key provision of that just came into effect last week, and that essentially requires that customs officers assume that goods originating from Xinjiang are made with forced labor, which is a great step forward. But that doesn’t cover all goods whose supply chains are tainted by forced labor by any means, right? So there’s a lot more to be done, even policy-wise in the United States. Is that right?</span></p>
<p><b>LM: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">I think that’s right. I mean, we do have a thing called the Tariff Act that was passed in 1930, it’s basically unprecedented globally, that bans the import of forced-labor made goods from anywhere. The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act puts a very fine point on it and says that we’re absolutely going to be scrutinizing and looking for products that are made in the Uyghur region. We’ve decided that&#8217;s a whole region-wide ban on goods made there because the presumption is that all of the goods made there are made with forced labor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the Tariff Act and its ability to monitor goods made with forced labor, it’s only been really put into effect for the last few years. And quite difficult, and it’s unusual. Like I said, it doesn’t exist in other parts of the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I think what we’re doing here with the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, I think, it’s a really good step, because it’s going to require companies to trace their supply chains. And due diligence mandatory human rights laws that are coming into effect in Europe, we hope soon, will also make them trace their supply chains. And that is important not just for the Uyghur region, but for addressing forced labor globally, and for holding corporations responsible and accountable for their use of these exploitative systems to make products cheap.</span></p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>In a hotly</u> contested 2020 primary, progressive Marie Newman, the Justice Democrats candidate for Illinois’s 3rd Congressional District, ousted eight-term Rep. Dan Lipinski, one of the last anti-abortion Democrats in Congress. Many House Democrats countered party norms by backing Newman, <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/10/01/marie-newman-endorsements-dan-lipinski/">choosing to stand up for reproductive rights</a> rather than exhibit loyalty to the incumbent. “I think that an anti-choice position is a relic of our past and it is firmly in the Republican ideology, and I do not think that is what our party should be standing for,” said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at the time.</p>
<p>But on Tuesday night, in the nation’s first primary elections since the Supreme Court <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/06/24/roe-wade-overturned-supreme-court-14th-amendment/">overturned</a> Roe v. Wade, the first-term representative was voted out of Congress by a large margin. Illinois redistricting forced Newman into a member-on-member primary, and she opted to run against Rep. Sean Casten, who was elected in 2018 and beat a six-term Republican. During her first primary as an incumbent, Newman faced challenges from outside Congress and within: outside groups that spent just under half a million dollars against her, and a congressional ethics <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/marie-newman-ethics-probe-progressive-1292976/">probe</a> that ultimately hurt her candidacy. Hers is the first loss of an incumbent backed by Justice Democrats.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, we did not get the result we were looking for this evening,” Newman said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/Marie4Congress/status/1541971025272913920">statement</a> conceding the race. “Win or lose, we have achieved something truly historic, and done so much good for this community.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Illinois, an anti-abortion Democrat backed by Lipinski came in fifth in the 1st Congressional District’s crowded field of 17 candidates. Progressives other than Newman saw mixed results in the state Tuesday night, offering some hope for the left while a Republican takeover of Congress looms.</p>

<p>In an open primary in Illinois’s newly drawn 3rd District, Working Families Party-backed state Rep. Delia Ramirez overcame a <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2022/6/23/23179500/about-2-8-million-in-outside-money-in-villegas-ramirez-illinois-3rd-congressional-primary">flood</a> of outside spending to defeat Chicago Alderman Gil Villegas, who had the support of conservative Democrats in the local machine and in Congress. In November, Ramirez will face Republican candidate Justin Burau, who ran in an uncontested primary on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Ramirez’s campaign was boosted by more than $1 million in outside spending from progressive groups including the Working Families Party and the Congressional Progressive Caucus PAC; WOMEN VOTE!, a project of EMILY’s List; and J Street Action Fund, along with several local unions. Ramirez was also endorsed by Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Reps. Jesús “Chuy” García, D-Ill., Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and CPC Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Sanders held a joint rally in Chicago to support Ramirez and Jackson. Villegas, who was previously the City Council floor leader for Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, was backed by the Chicago Tribune, conservative members of the Chicago City Council, the clerk of the Circuit Court of Cook County, and unions including the Chicago Police Sergeants’ Association. Capitalizing on salient tough-on-crime narratives, Villegas had <a href="https://www.wbez.org/stories/ramirez-villegas-frontrunners-in-3rd-district-race/6b222d68-e674-47a9-b8a7-348305a04f7f">claimed</a> that Ramirez would “defund the police.”</p>
<p>In the 7th District contest, the Chicago Tribune endorsed Collins on June 13 and wrote that while Davis’s long tenure and record of public service had earned the respect of the editorial board, “we think the time has come for new blood, and we endorse Collins.” His campaign started running ads in the final weeks before the primary, including one bizarre <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBRzKG5Hkb4">clip</a> that showed him speaking in front of a virtual image of the Capitol on Zoom.</p>

<p><u>With her surprise</u> testimony at Tuesday&#8217;s hearing of the House Jan. 6 committee, former Trump aide Cassidy Hutchinson broke open the inside story of the coup plotting that was underway at the White House before and during the insurrection and in the process suddenly raised Donald Trump’s legal jeopardy.</p>
<p>Above all, Hutchinson, a former aide to Mark Meadows, Trump’s White House chief of staff, showed that the president knew that many of his supporters who marched on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, were armed and dangerous, and still encouraged them to march on Congress. He even sought to go to the U.S. Capitol himself to lead the armed mob in person and lunged at a Secret Service agent to try to take control of his presidential limousine.</p>
<p>Hutchinson’s stunning testimony, the most dramatic since the House hearings started, recalls that of Alexander Butterfield, the White House aide during Watergate who revealed to the Senate Watergate Committee that President Richard Nixon had a taping system in place in the Oval Office. Butterfield’s testimony suddenly changed the trajectory of the Watergate scandal and helped lead to Nixon’s 1974 resignation.</p>

<p>The January 6 hearings have disclosed far more than was previously known about Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, raising questions about why the Justice Department has not been as aggressive in its own inquiry. The success of the House hearings may finally be forcing the Justice Department to <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/06/25/fbi-raid-on-trump-justice-department-official-signals-a-criminal-investigation-may-be-starting/">intensify its criminal investigation</a>. Last week, the FBI raided the home of Jeffrey Clark, a former Justice Department official who sought to help Trump pressure state officials not to certify Joe Biden’s win in Georgia; the Justice Department also seized the phone of John Eastman, a lawyer for Trump who wrote memos urging then-Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the presidential election during the congressional certification process.</p>
<p>During Tuesday’s hearing, Hutchinson painted a vivid picture of Trump’s insane behavior as he sought to prevent Biden from assuming office. He had incited the mob during a speech outside the White House, urging his supporters to go up to the Capitol while Congress was in the process of certifying the election. The crowd followed his directions and marched to the Capitol.</p>
<p>Immediately after his speech, he tried to grab the steering wheel of his limousine from the Secret Service agent who was driving in order to go to the Capitol himself.</p>
<p>By that time, Trump was already furious that the Secret Service was refusing to let his heavily armed supporters into the secured area outside the White House. Hutchinson testified that Trump said that “they’re not here to hurt me. Take the fucking mags away,” referring to the metal detectors used to check for weapons. “Let my people in. They can march to the Capitol from here.”</p>
<p>Beyond January 6, Hutchinson also revealed that Trump was mentally unbalanced throughout the months in which he sought to overturn the election. She said that on December 1, 2020, Trump threw a plate with ketchup on it against a wall in the White House when he found out that Attorney General William Barr had just told the press that there was no significant voter fraud during the presidential election. She added that Trump had thrown objects in the White House before, including inside the Oval Office.</p>
<p>Hutchinson also said that Meadows did almost nothing to try to rein in Trump during the insurrection and later sought a presidential pardon.</p>
<p>Hutchinson’s testimony came as Rep. Liz Cheney, the Wyoming Republican who is vice chair of the House committee, said that there is evidence of witness tampering against others speaking to the committee. She said several witnesses have received phone calls and messages in which people have tried to pressure them before testifying.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>The day after</u> the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Facebook’s parent company, Meta, internally designated the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/06/16/janes-revenge-abortion-rights/">abortion rights group</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/11/pro-choice-militants-pregnancy-crisis-centers-attacks-us">Jane’s Revenge</a> as a terrorist organization, according to company materials reviewed by The Intercept, subjecting discussion of the group and its actions to the company’s most stringent censorship policies. Experts say the decision, Meta’s first known policy response for the post-Roe era, threatens free expression around abortion rights at a critical moment.</p>
<p>The brief internal bulletin from Meta Platforms Inc., which owns Instagram and Facebook, was titled “[EMERGENCY Micro Policy Update] [Terrorism] Jane&#8217;s Revenge” and filed to the company’s internal <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/10/12/facebook-secret-blacklist-dangerous/">Dangerous Individuals and Organizations rulebook</a>, meaning that the abortion rights group, which has so far committed only <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/des-moines/2022/06/13/janes-revenge-claims-vandalized-des-moines-resource-center">acts of vandalism</a>, will be treated with the same speech restrictions against “praise, support, and representation” applied to the Islamic State and Hitler. The memo, circulated to Meta moderators on June 25, describes Jane&#8217;s Revenge as “a far-left extremist group that has claimed responsibility on its website for an attack against an anti-abortion group&#8217;s office in Madison, Wisconsin in May 2022. The group is responsible for multiple arson and vandalism attacks on pro-life institutions.” Terrorist groups receive Meta’s strictest “Tier 1” speech limits, treatment the company says is reserved for the world’s most dangerous and violent entities, <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/dangerous-individuals-organizations/">along with</a> hate groups, drug cartels, and mass murderers.</p>
<p>Although The Intercept published a <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/document/2021/10/12/facebook-dangerous-individuals-and-organizations-list-reproduced-snapshot/">snapshot</a> of the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/10/12/facebook-secret-blacklist-dangerous/">entire secret Dangerous Individuals and Organizations list last year</a>, Meta does not disclose or explain additions to the public, despite the urging of scholars, activists, and its own Oversight Board. Speech advocates and civil society groups have <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/so-what-does-facebook-take-down-secret-list-dangerous-individuals-and">criticized</a> the policy for its secrecy, bias toward U.S. governmental priorities, and <a href="https://www.oversightboard.com/decision/IG-I9DP23IB/">tendency</a> to <a href="https://www.oversightboard.com/decision/FB-P93JPX02/">inaccurately</a> <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/01/19/facebook-tamil-censorship-sri-lanka/">delete</a> <a href="https://www.oversightboard.com/decision/FB-2RDRCAVQ/">nonviolent</a> <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/10/08/israel/palestine-facebook-censors-discussion-rights-issues">political speech</a>. According to Meta’s most recent quarterly transparency <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/data/community-standards-enforcement/dangerous-organizations/facebook/">report</a>, the company restored nearly half a million posts between January and March in the terrorism category alone after determining that they had been censored erroneously.</p>

<p>Discussion of Jane’s Revenge was already technically subject to Tier 1 censorship stemming from another previously unreported internal speech restriction enacted by Meta last month. In May, just days after Politico published a leaked Supreme Court decision auguring the reversal of Roe v. Wade, the office of Wisconsin Family Action, an anti-abortion group, was vandalized. The very next day, Meta silently banned its roughly 2 billion users from “praising, supporting, or representing” the vandalism or its perpetrators, according to company materials reviewed by The Intercept. While these event-based restrictions are often temporary, the more recent use of the formal “terror” label suggests a more permanent policy position.</p>
<p>&#8220;This designation is difficult to square with Meta&#8217;s placement of the Oath Keepers and Three Percenters in Tier 3, which is subject to far fewer restrictions, despite their role organizing and participating in the January 6 Capitol attack,&#8221; said Mary Pat Dwyer, academic program director of Georgetown Law School&#8217;s Institute for Technology Law and Policy. &#8220;And while it&#8217;s possible Meta has moved those groups into Tier 1 more recently, that only highlights the lack of transparency into when and how these decisions, which have a huge impact on people&#8217;s abilities to discuss current events and important political issues, are made.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Wisconsin incident, which consisted of a small fire and graffiti denouncing the group’s anti-abortion stance, resulted in only minor property damage to the empty office. But the vandalism was rapidly designated a “Violating Violent Event,” a kind of ad hoc speech restriction that Meta distributes to its content moderation staff to limit discussion across its platforms in response to breaking news and various international crises, typically prominent events like the January 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol, terrorism, public shootings, or ethnic bloodshed.</p>
<p>“We are internally classifying this as a Violating Violent Event (General Designation),” reads the May 11 internal memo, obtained by The Intercept. “All content praising, supporting or representing the event and/or perpetrator(s) should be removed from the platform.” The dispatch instructed moderators to censor depiction and discussion of the vandalism under the Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy framework, which restricts speech about violent actors like terror cells, neo-Nazis, and drug cartels. “The office of a conservative political organization that lobbies against abortion rights was vandalized and damaged by fire in Madison, Wisconsin,” the memo continued. “A group called Jane&#8217;s Revenge took credit for the attack.” The number of victims of the &#8220;Violating Violent Event&#8221; is marked as “0.”</p>
<p>The Wisconsin Family Action designation is notable not only for the relative low severity of the attack itself, which Madison police are investigating as an act of arson, but also because it marks a rare foray by Facebook into limiting speech around abortion. Striking as well is the company’s choice to censor abortion rights action, even destructive action, given that throughout the long history of the American abortion debate, the overwhelming majority of violence has been conducted by those seeking to thwart access to the procedure via bombings and assassinations, not expand it. Earlier this month, Axios <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/06/24/attacks-violence-abortion-provider-roe-bans">reported</a> that “assaults directed at abortion clinic staff and patients increased 128% last year over 2020,” according to a report from the National Abortion Federation. And yet of the more than 4,000 names on the company’s Dangerous Individuals and Organizations list, only two are associated with anti-abortion violence or terrorism: the Army of God Christian terrorist cell and one of its affiliates, the notorious bomber Eric Rudolph. While <a href="https://medium.com/dfrlab/us-right-wing-influencers-stoke-fears-of-left-wing-mass-violence-after-supreme-court-ruling-on-c1d6416efc2b">extremely little</a> is known about Jane’s Revenge, including whether the vandalism is even being committed by the same actors and <a href="https://reason.com/2022/06/21/janes-revenge-abortion-terror-group-or-terror-hoax/">to what extent</a> it is even a group, prominent <a href="https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?id=9D361F62-D068-4236-8987-96EFAC3FBE7D">right-wing</a> politicians <a href="https://mullin.house.gov/uploadedfiles/mullin_letter_to_dhs_and_fbi_re_janes_revenge.pdf">have</a> begun demanding that the property damage be treated as domestic terrorism, a stance now essentially endorsed by Meta.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[2](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A1%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="1"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[2] -->
<p>But the company also appears to have avoided censoring discussion of more recent anti-abortion acts comparable to the Wisconsin fire. On New Year&#8217;s Eve, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/07/us/knoxville-planned-parenthood-arson.html">arsonists destroyed a Planned Parenthood clinic in Knoxville, Tennessee</a>, that had been riddled with bullets earlier in the year on the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade ruling. According to multiple sources familiar with Facebook’s content moderation policies, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not permitted to speak to the press, the New Year’s Eve Planned Parenthood torching was never similarly designated a “Violating Violent Event.” While anti-abortion advocates are still barred from inciting further violence against Planned Parenthood clinics (or anything else), Meta users now have far greater latitude to discuss — or even praise — that instance of anti-abortion violence than comparable acts from the other side.</p>
<p>The frequently malfunctioning nature of Facebook’s global censorship rules also means that the Wisconsin-specific update and more recent terror label, even if intended only to thwart future real-world acts of violence from either side of the abortion debate, could end up stifling legitimate political speech. While the company’s general purpose “Community Standards” rulebook places a blanket prohibition against any explicit calls for violence, only explicitly flagged people, groups, and events are subject to Meta’s far more stringent bans against “praise, support, and representation,” restrictions that bar users from quoting, depicting, or speaking positively of the entity or action in question. But the ambiguous formulation and frequently uneven enforcement of these rules means that speech far short of crossing the red line of violent incitement is subject to deletion. The Dangerous Individuals and Organizations ban on &#8220;praise, support, and representation&#8221; has been frequently cited by Facebook when <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/28/facebook-palestinian-censorship/">deleting posts documenting or protesting Israeli state violence</a> against Palestinians, for example, instances of which have at times been designated &#8220;Violating Violent Events&#8221; as well.</p>
<p>Jane’s Revenge is poorly understood, controversial, and subject to intense debate at precisely the time the Dangerous Individuals and Organizations designations mean that billions of people are limited in what they can say about the perpetrators, their motives, or their methods. Anything that could be construed as “praise,” however tentative, risks deletion. Indeed, even Facebook’s public description of the “praise, support, and representation” standard notes that any posts “Legitimizing the cause of a designated entity by making claims that their hateful, violent, or criminal conduct is legally, morally, or otherwise justified or acceptable” are prohibited.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[3] -->“There are legitimate concerns that this might shut down debate.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[3] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[3] -->
<p>The company’s internal overview of the “praise” standard, obtained and published by The Intercept last year, directs moderators to delete anything that “engages in value-based statements and emotive argument” or “seeks to make others think more positively” of the sanctioned entity or event. While these internal rules permit “Academic debate and informative, educational discourse” of a violent entity or event, what meets the threshold for “academic debate” or “informative discourse” is left to Facebook’s thousands of overworked, low-paid hourly contractors to determine.</p>
<p>Content moderation experts who spoke to The Intercept said the policy threatens discussion and debate of abortion rights protests at a time when such speech is of profound national importance. “What we&#8217;ve seen in the past is that when Facebook bans certain types of harmful speech, they often catch counterspeech and other types of commentary in their content moderation net,” said Jillian York, director for international freedom of expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “For example, efforts to ban terrorist content often result in the removal of counterspeech against terrorism or the sharing of documentation. The use of automated technologies only exacerbates this; therefore, it isn&#8217;t difficult to imagine that an attempt to ban vandalism against an anti-abortion group could also ban legitimate speech against such a group.”</p>
<p>Evelyn Douek, a Harvard Law School lecturer and fellow with the Knight First Amendment Institute, described the ad hoc censorship of “violating events” via the Dangerous Individuals and Organizations framework as “extremely capacious” and “one of Facebook&#8217;s most controversial and problematic policies,” both because these designations are made in secret and because they are so likely to constitute subjective political determinations. While Meta moderators are provided with an extensive rulebook containing this designation and countless others, the combination of the company’s increasing reliance on automated algorithmic content screening and the personal judgment calls of low-paid, overworked contractors creates erratic, faulty results. “There are legitimate concerns that this might shut down debate,” said Douek.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[4](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22left%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-left" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="left"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[4] -->“Ukrainians get to say violent shit, Palestinians don&#8217;t. White supremacists do, pro-choice people don&#8217;t.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[4] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[4] -->
<p>Douek said the opacity of the censorship policy, paired with Facebook’s “incredibly blunt and error-prone” enforcement of speech restrictions, poses a threat to political discussion and debate around both abortion per se and the broader reproductive rights movement. Even those who don’t condone the methods of Jane’s Revenge have an interest in talking about them and perhaps even entertaining them: There is a vast universe of discourse about political direct action and violence, even vandalism, that isn’t in and of itself incitement, a swath of speech that could be vacuumed up by Facebook’s bludgeon approach to speech rules. “[Saying] you support the goals, the underlying policy of what Jane’s Revenge is fighting for, even if you disagree with their tactics, there&#8217;s all sorts of conversation here that we have about lots of different groups in society on the margins that I&#8217;m worried about losing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Significant as well is the fact that a free expression around relatively minor acts of violence would not only be censored in the first place but also subjected to the same limits Facebook uses for Al Qaeda and the Third Reich. “It&#8217;s somewhat remarkable that this act of vandalism was so quickly added to the list. It really is intended to be reserved for the most serious kind of incidents” like hate crimes, gun massacres, and terrorist attacks, Douek explained, “a policy that&#8217;s really targeted at the worst of the worst.” The decision to censor free discussion of Jane’s Revenge, responsible for a failed firebombing and a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/11/pro-choice-militants-pregnancy-crisis-centers-attacks-us">series of threatening graffiti incidents</a>, makes the fact that Facebook did not similarly limit discussion of the Tennessee Planned Parenthood arson even more puzzling. Douek and York place that decision in a long history of Facebook putting its finger on the scales of political discourse in a way that often appears ideologically motivated, or on other occasions completely arbitrary. “It&#8217;s precisely the issue raised by their constant picking and choosing of ‘winners,’” York told The Intercept. “Ukrainians get to say violent shit, Palestinians don&#8217;t. White supremacists do, pro-choice people don&#8217;t.”</p>
<p>In an email to The Intercept, Meta spokesperson Devon Kearns confirmed the terror designation of Jane’s Revenge and said that the company “will remove content that praises, supports, or represents the organization.” Kearns stated that the company has a multifaceted process when determining which people and groups are restricted under the Dangerous Organizations policy, but did not say what it was or why Jane’s Revenge had been flagged but not other actors committing violence to advance their stance on abortion. Kearns further noted that users may appeal deletions made through the Dangerous Organizations policy if they believe it was made in error.</p>
<p>Assessing the merits of a decision made and implemented in secret is exceedingly difficult. Although Meta provides a generalized, big-picture overview of what sort of speech is barred from its platforms with a handful of uncontroversial examples (e.g., “If you want to fight for the Caliphate, DM me”), the specifics of the rules are concealed from the billions of people expected to heed them, as is any rationale as to why the rules were drafted in the first place. York told The Intercept that the Jane’s Revenge move is another indication that Meta needs to “immediately institute the Santa Clara Principles,” a content moderation <a href="https://santaclaraprinciples.org/">policy charter</a> that mandates “clear and precise rules and policies relating to when action will be taken with respect to users’ content or accounts,” among many other items.</p>
<p>Without the entirety of the company’s rules and their justification provided to the public, Meta, which exercises an enormous degree of control over what speech is allowed on the internet, leaves billions posting in the dark. Meta’s claim has always been that it takes no sides on any issue and only deletes speech in the name of safety, a claim the public generally has to take as an article of faith given the company’s deep secrecy in both what the rules are and how they’re enforced. “For a platform that is consistently insisting that it&#8217;s neutral and doesn&#8217;t have its finger on the scale, it’s really incumbent on Meta to be much more forthcoming,” Douek added. “These are highly charged political decisions, and they need to be able to defend them.”</p>

Damon T. Hininger, the chief executive, paused to share the news on a call with investors last month: CoreCivic Inc. was the first company after the George Floyd protests to proactively conduct a “racial equity audit,” the results of which it was now ready to release.</p>
<p>&#8220;CoreCivic is one of the very few companies in the United States that has proactively embraced the process,&#8221; Hininger gloated.</p>
<p>The private prison corporation’s stock price and access to bond markets had been battered by pressure over its role in profiting from immigrant detention and for providing <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/23/private-prisons-back-trump-and-could-see-big-payoffs-new-policies/98300394/">financial support</a> to Donald Trump’s presidency. The company is currently facing a <a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2022/06/03/21-55221.pdf">class-action lawsuit</a> brought by immigration detainees claiming that they were forced to work with little or no pay. The racial equity audit was a conscious effort by CoreCivic not only to mend its poor public image, but also to harness public interest in racial justice to bring the company back into the good graces of Wall Street investors.</p>
<p>The contents of CoreCivic’s audit pointed to mostly superficial contributions to diversity and equity. The report, conducted by Moore &amp; Van Allen, a North Carolina-based law firm, offered some room for improvement but largely applauded the private prison giant for its &#8220;genuine&#8221; commitment to diversity principles, including by raising cultural awareness with a mural of Martin Luther King Jr. at one of its Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers in Arizona. The report also praised CoreCivic for its philanthropy and business practices that have “benefitted communities of color.”</p>
<p>In an accompanying report on the company’s diversity, equity, and inclusion — known as DEI — CoreCivic touted its ranks of nonwhite prison guards, diversity on its board of directors, and diverse ranks of wardens, as well as its partnership with a Black-led, pro-business trade group.</p>
<p>Those supposed strides elicited eye rolls among its critics. &#8220;They put children&#8217;s murals on the wall while incarcerating infants. That doesn&#8217;t mean they have positive impacts for children,” said Bob Libal, a longtime watchdog of the private prison industry, referencing the company’s Taylor, Texas-based ICE detention center.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->
<p>&#8220;This is hollow at best, and probably a deeply cynical attempt to whitewash a company that has a horrible reputation, a horrible track record of abuse and neglect of people who&#8217;ve been sentenced in their facilities,” added Libal. The company has faced <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/idaho/articles/2021-07-14/officials-major-understaffing-in-idaho-prisons-raises-risks">multiple</a> allegations of severe understaffing and safety issues, as well as unsanitary conditions in many facilities.</p>
<p>“The reality is, CoreCivic&#8217;s entire existence is offensive to Black and brown communities. They&#8217;re trying to create some version, right, some image that they aren&#8217;t one thousand percent harmful,” said Bianca Tylek, the founder of Worth Rises, an advocacy group that focuses on the privatization of the criminal justice system.<br />

Tylek received a call from Moore &amp; Van Allen in an attempt to include her perspective in the CoreCivic report, which she declined. The company initially included her name as a validator without her permission anyway, Tylek said. She was later removed from the report.</p>
<p>&#8220;The audit tells us nothing,” said Tylek. “The private prison business model is the problem. Everything they do is the problem, and to be honest, sometimes we&#8217;re at odds with other advocates because these racial equity audits are absolutely ridiculous and not an effective advocacy tool.”</p>
<p>Asked for comment about activist concerns, CoreCivic reiterated its support for the “principles of diversity, equity and inclusion.” The company, said spokesperson Ryan Gustin, “didn’t hesitate to participate in the recent racial equity audit.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22left%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-left" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="left"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[3] -->&#8220;They put children&#8217;s murals on the wall while incarcerating infants. That doesn&#8217;t mean they have positive impacts for children.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[3] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[3] -->
<p>But Tylek, Libal, and members of the activist community are not the intended audience for the report; the racial equity audit and similar measures are part of an opaque and virtually unregulated rubric that sets the flow of massive piles of investor dollars. CoreCivic’s gestures are meant to shape its standing in “environmental, social, and governance,” or ESG, funds, a catchall term for a system that allows investors to put their money into companies that score as socially responsible by various metrics.</p>
<p>Compliance can be lucrative. For instance, among the many ESG ratings agencies, a company with nonwhite or female board members or a decision to simply conduct a racial equity audit or DEI report can automatically lead to a higher score, and corporations with high ESG rankings find placement in special exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, that are marketed as socially responsible, opening the door for investor cash.</p>
<p>Over $35 trillion in global assets are invested in funds that claim to vet companies using ESG principles, making the label one of the hottest trends in finance. Following the racial justice protests of 2020, a coalition of institutional funds, which now includes the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, a pension fund with over $250 billion in assets, launched proxy campaigns to pressure publicly traded companies to undergo racial equity audits and to prioritize racial diversity issues.</p>

<p>Proponents of the approach claim that the market sprouting up around ESG principles provides a window, guiding investors into safer, less controversial companies while creating a market incentive for good corporate behavior, whether on racial justice, the climate crisis, or any number of issues.</p>
<p>Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock Inc. and one of the most powerful ESG-focused asset managers in the world, has described the move toward socially responsible investing as a “tectonic shift” that stands to reshape capitalism as we know it. In his <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-chairmans-letter">letter</a> to investors this year, Fink made clear that racially diverse boards and racial diversity would be a focus of his company.</p>
<p>BlackRock is among the many corporations that sponsor television advertisements — the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z65gyBWSY8o">featuring</a> NBA star Jalen Duren — touting their socially responsible or sustainable investment funds, luring ordinary retail investors.</p>
<p>But a growing chorus of critics have questioned the lofty promises of ESG investing. The high-minded rhetoric of the movement, they argue, serves to enrich a small set of ESG-focused consultants and fund managers while misleading the public and investor community and providing little to no benefit to society. They charge that the investing trend is no more than reputation laundering and, potentially, fraud on an industrial scale.</p>
<p>&#8220;People who are buying these funds almost always believe that they&#8217;re doing something to make the world a better place, and in reality, they&#8217;re just moving shares around in publicly traded companies,” said Tariq Fancy, the former chief investment officer for social responsibility investing at BlackRock, who has emerged in recent years as a critic of ESG.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[5](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22none%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-none" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="none"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[5] -->&#8220;People who are buying these funds almost always believe that they&#8217;re doing something to make the world a better place, and in reality, they&#8217;re just moving shares around in publicly traded companies.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[5] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[5] -->
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s actually dangerous because they imply real-world impact, creating a societal placebo,” continued Fancy. “It actually lowers the case for government regulation. If you think you can do something quick and easy like ESG, then it follows to say, ‘We don&#8217;t need a carbon tax.’”</p>
<p>Fancy also finds the righteous rhetoric of his former employer hypocritical. BlackRock will make a fortune in fees promoting an ESG model entirely based on voluntary self-reporting requirements and opaque scores, said Fancy, while using its power as a shareholder to block proposals that call on companies to disclose political spending — the very political spending that corporations use to prevent any meaningful laws and government regulations on social welfare spending or pollution.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like they&#8217;re giving us talking points on good sportsmanship, meanwhile, they’re saying it&#8217;s all right for teams to secretly pay off the referees.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an email, BlackRock spokesperson Matt Kobussen noted that the company provides multiple ESG index products, some of which include CoreCivic and others of which do not. The ETF that includes private prisons is based on ESG criteria provided by the index provider S&amp;P, while another, the MSCI Small Cap ESG Aware, uses an index provided by MSCI and &#8220;does not have exposure to CoreCivic or GEO Group,” another main prison company.</p>
<p>Despite the rhetoric, the portfolio managers preaching the gospel of ESG are in fact legally prohibited from doing anything that compromises corporate profits. The types of changes they promote are superficial at best, critics charge.</p>
<p>What’s more, regulators have taken notice that fund managers have marketed ESG investing with little due diligence in regard to how companies are changing any actual business practices or whether companies included in the funds meet the stated criteria. In May, around 50 German police officers raided the Frankfurt offices of DWS Group, the asset manager subsidiary of Deutsche Bank. The investigation stems from allegations by a former DWS Group executive that the company had made <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0eb64160-9e41-44b6-8550-742a6a4b1022">misleading</a> statements about how ESG assets were allocated.</p>
<p>And this year, the Bank of New York Mellon Corp.&#8217;s asset manager paid $1.5 million to settle claims by the Securities and Exchange Commission over “misstatements and omissions about ESG considerations.” The bank, as part of the settlement, did not admit any guilt.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, word leaked that the SEC is currently investigating Goldman Sachs Group Inc. over similar claims about its ESG mutual fund business. In June 2020, Goldman Sachs renamed its blue-chip fund as the U.S. Equity ESG Fund, while maintaining the same top holdings.</p>
<p>Last month, the SEC began collecting comments for new regulations aimed at boosting transparency and accountability around ESG funds.</p>
<h2>Measures of Goodness</h2>
<p>At the core of the criticisms is the fact that there is no set definition for how ESG rankings are devised. Competing ratings agencies and financial analysts offer a tangled web of various scores, with no consistency from firm to firm.</p>
<p>Charles Schwab Corp.&#8217;s asset management arm, for example, last year launched Schwab Ariel ESG ETF, an ESG fund that excludes tobacco products, the extraction of fossil fuels, weapons manufacturers, and operators of private prisons such as CoreCivic.</p>
<p>Other asset managers, however, sell ESG funds that do include private prisons. BlackRock’s iShares ESG Screened S&amp;P Small-Cap ETF, one of its social responsibility funds, includes CoreCivic. Investors purchasing shares in DWS Group’s Xtrackers S&amp;P SmallCap 600 ESG are also buying a slice of CoreCivic.</p>
<p>State Street Corp., an asset manager that is one of the loudest and most prominent proponents of ESG, markets a social responsibility fund, SPDR S&amp;P SmallCap 600 ESG ETF, that owns shares in CoreCivic as well as the second-largest private prison company in the U.S., GEO Group Inc.</p>
<p>State Street spokesperson Deborah Heindel said in an email that ESG can be very broad or specific depending on who&#8217;s defining the term. &#8220;Case in point, a Google search pulls several million results from countless sources,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Ratings agencies can change ESG formulas on a dime, with little public notice. Fund managers are free to choose any ratings agency with any formula, often with most sources of information completely self-reported by corporations.</p>
<p>CoreCivic, in its own ESG report, touts a 2021 award issued by Newsweek/Statista claiming that it is one of America&#8217;s most responsible companies. The Newsweek/Statista ESG rankings give CoreCivic a high social rating in part based on the prison company’s commitment to &#8220;good causes&#8221; and the number of women and racial minorities on its board of directors.</p>
<p>The criteria for what constitutes a socially responsible investment can change from day to day. In March, analysts from Citigroup Inc. suggested that companies that manufacture weapons used for the war in Ukraine to thwart the Russian invasion could count toward a better ESG score. “Defending the values of liberal democracies and creating a deterrent, which preserves peace and global stability,” they wrote.</p>
<p>Before this year, many ESG funds promoted the exclusion of certain arms manufacturers, arguing that the global sale of bombs and missiles did not constitute a social good — now there’s a push to reward arms makers. If a shift in public opinion can reshape the entire model, that leaves many to wonder how any fund can claim fixed principles when ideas around social responsibility are inherently subjective.</p>
<p>“It’s a scam, that’s all it is, a scam,” said Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at New York University&#8217;s Stern School of Business, of ESG. “How can you have a measure of goodness? Or let me put it another way: Name me one social factor where we have consensus in society. How the heck are we going to come up with one score?”</p>
<p>The CoreCivic board of directors, its <a href="https://www.corecivic.com/hubfs/2021-ESGReport.pdf">ESG report</a> proudly notes, is 36 percent &#8220;gender or racially diverse,&#8221; a figure that the company notes won recognition from a women&#8217;s advocacy group. The private prison company’s board includes Donna Alvarado, a former Reagan administration official, and Thurgood Marshall Jr., the son of the former Supreme Court justice.</p>
<p>“For-profit incarceration is the antithesis of social responsibility,” said Libal. “They&#8217;ve made profits on the back of incarceration at record numbers while contributing millions of dollars in campaign contributions to ensure their interests are met.”</p>
<p>“If your board is diverse, it doesn&#8217;t matter what you&#8217;re selling, right?” he added. “If you have enough women on the board of Blackwater, that doesn&#8217;t make mercenary companies a positive influence on the world.”</p>

<h2>“Greenwashing Is a Feature, Not a Bug”</h2>
<p>Fulfilling diversity goals is a highly visible way to offset lower scores in other areas. Defense contractors, fossil fuel companies, banks, and pharmaceutical giants that annually hike the prices of lifesaving drugs have all used diversity metrics to earn placement as socially responsible companies, eligible for placement in lucrative ESG funds. And according to a review by The Intercept, several of the corporations commonly included in ESGs have recently been under investigation or scrutiny, engaging in business practices that few would call socially responsible.</p>
<p>Eli Lilly and Co., the pharmaceutical company, is facing multiple regulatory and legal battles over its practice of hiking the price of insulin. The company raised the price of its Humalog line of insulin products by 1,219 percent since it launched. The high prevalence of diabetes among nonwhite Americans has placed the rising costs of insulin disproportionately on members of racial minority groups, a dynamic that some public health researchers argue amounts to a form of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9172261/">structural racism</a>.</p>
<p>But the disparate impact of drug pricing dynamics are not measured by ESG scores. Instead, the Eli Lilly report notes that the company promotes diversity through a variety of measures, such as DEI training and employee resource groups that sponsor events such as the Lunar New Year Gala.</p>
<p>Those efforts are among the qualifications used to include Eli Lilly prominently in multiple ESG exchange-traded funds. Eli Lilly is the second-largest holding of a BlackRock fund <a href="https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/literature/fact-sheet/open-ishares-refinitiv-inclusion-and-diversity-ucits-etf-fund-fact-sheet-en-gb.pdf">marketed</a> as focused on promoting companies that excel in the fields of diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p>Just Capital, a not-for-profit group that provides ESG rankings, scores Amazon as an industry leader and a three-time winner of its America&#8217;s Most Just Companies award. Despite an aggressive anti-union campaign against its warehouse workers in Alabama and New York that has garnered international condemnation and <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/03/25/amazon-drivers-pee-bottles-union/">wide-ranging complaints</a> about working conditions, the Seattle-based company has a mixed record in the category of labor practices. But the score is boosted by Amazon&#8217;s “diversity, equity, and inclusion” policies and the total number of jobs the company has created — two areas in which Just Capital ranks Amazon as the best company in America.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[8](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A1%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="1"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[8] -->
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s smoke and mirrors. From a social, from a labor perspective, it&#8217;s not a good company. That&#8217;s like rating the Triangle Shirtwaist Co. a model employer in New York,” said Seth Goldstein, an attorney for the Amazon Labor Union, which represents warehouse workers who won an upset victory to form the company’s first labor union.</p>
<p>Just Capital — whose board includes HuffPost founder Arianna Huffington and Marc Morial, the president of the National Urban League — partners with Goldman Sachs to promote a special ESG fund that utilizes the organization’s social responsibility analytics. The third-largest holding for the fund is Amazon.</p>
<p>In response to an inquiry from The Intercept, Just Capital said that Amazon was scored on a number of factors. “We find that, like many other companies, Amazon is both a leader and a laggard relative to its peers across all of the individual stakeholder categories that we measure, from communities to environment to workers,” wrote Martin Whittaker, chief executive of Just Capital, in a statement to The Intercept.</p>
<p>PepsiCo Inc. and Coca-Cola Co., for instance, routinely score well on ESG rankings through relatively low greenhouse gas emissions, while delivering a core product that is fueling a crisis of diabetes, obesity, and heart disease, noted Hans Taparia, an associate professor also at NYU&#8217;s Stern School of Business, in an <a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_world_may_be_better_off_without_esg_investing">article</a> for the Stanford Social Innovation Review. Alphabet, Amazon, and Facebook are also among the largest holdings of ESG funds but engage in a variety of monopoly, surveillance advertising practices and provide a core product that has fueled mental health issues among users. They all tout DEI and diversity-related measures in the glossy ESG reports that are submitted to fund managers.</p>
<p>“If a company’s core business model does so much harm,” wrote Taparia, “the cover-up through ‘good behavior’ on other parameters shouldn’t be so easy.”</p>
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp., one of the largest oil and gas companies in the world, has been cited as a prime example of an ESG <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/esg/exxon-activist-victory-marks-coming-of-age-for-esg-investing">victory</a>, after the company <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/09/business/exxon-mobil-engine-no1-activist.html">added</a> board members viewed as more favorable to action on climate change last year in response to pressure from activist investors and ESG-minded asset managers.</p>
<p>But there is still little evidence that ExxonMobil has changed any core fossil fuel-related business practices. The oil giant has massively increased spending on green-related marketing, and the word “climate” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/16/oil-firms-climate-claims-are-greenwashing-study-concludes">now appears</a> all over its corporate reports. The company has <a href="https://pulse2.com/why-exxonmobil-xom-is-selling-the-barnett-shale-assets-for-750-million/">sold off</a> some assets that will be developed by other companies.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[9](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[9] -->Calls for decarbonization, once central in the ESG movement, can also be offset by racial metrics.<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[9] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[9] -->
<p>Damodaran and his NYU colleagues have chronicled many of the inconsistencies and the subjective nature of ESG rankings. As oil majors sell off carbon-intensive oil and gas assets in order to comply with ESG fund objectives, Damodaran noted, the same assets are being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/13/climate/private-equity-funds-oil-gas-fossil-fuels.html">purchased</a> by private equity firms that are far less accountable, a shift in hands that he argues nullifies any greenhouse gas benefit from the campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;So basically, here&#8217;s what you accomplished,&#8221; said Damodaran. &#8220;You took the reserves out of a company where you had a semblance of prudent strategy in process and put it in the hands of the least scrupulous people on the face of the Earth. And if you declared this to be a victory, I&#8217;d hate to see what your defeat looks like.&#8221;</p>
<p>The calls for decarbonization, once central in the ESG movement, can also be offset by racial metrics. ESG rankings maintained by the S&amp;P 500 now include ExxonMobil but exclude electric car marker Tesla Inc. One of the reasons? Racial discrimination charges lodged against Tesla, a dynamic bitterly highlighted by Tesla chief executive Elon Musk on Twitter. Many of the charges, including a class-action lawsuit, are still making their way through court.</p>
<p>Researchers have also found that companies selectively omit certain suppliers and business practices in order to <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3700310">artificially report</a> low carbon emissions and thereby gain higher ESG scores.</p>
<p>One of the most revealing reports came from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-what-is-esg-investing-msci-ratings-focus-on-corporate-bottom-line/">Bloomberg News</a>, which found that one of the largest ESG ranking companies, MSCI Inc., which BlackRock uses to market &#8220;sustainable&#8221; stocks and bonds, provided year-to-year upgraded rankings to companies that increased levels of carbon emissions.</p>
<p>In the case of McDonald&#8217;s Corp., MSCI provided an upgraded ESG ranking despite the fact that the company produced an increase of 7 percent in global emissions over four years. The ratings agency made the determination because the climate crisis did not pose a special risk or &#8220;opportunity&#8221; for the company.</p>
<p>The MSCI rankings for climate change score corporations over the possibility of climate regulations and whether restrictions on carbon emissions could harm future profits. In other words, when anti-regulation Republicans take office, the environmental scores of fossil fuel companies improve.</p>
<p>When MSCI gave positive &#8220;water stress&#8221; scores, the rating had no bearing on pollution or discharges into local water systems. Rather, the scores were awarded based on whether chemical companies had enough water to sustain their factories — an inversion of the very idea of environmentalism that reporters labeled as blatant <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-what-is-esg-investing-msci-ratings-focus-on-corporate-bottom-line/?sref=nHQs8PiA">doublespeak</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is exactly what gamification looks like: You create the rules of the game, I&#8217;ll find a way to play it,&#8221; said Damodaran. &#8220;A lot of ESG advocates say ESG would work except for the greenwashing. And my response is, greenwashing is a feature, not a bug. It&#8217;s exactly what you get when you create something like ESG.&#8221;<br />

<h2>High-Minded Rhetoric, Even Higher Fees</h2>
<p>Three weeks after the George Floyd protests began in 2020, Marvin Owens, then the senior director for economic programs at the NAACP, appeared on CNBC to tout an ESG-style fund on diversity branded with the NAACP.</p>
<p>“The problem that has existed for ESG is that the &#8216;S&#8217; has been very difficult to define, and that&#8217;s why an organization like the NAACP, with its 111-year history of being advocates for African Americans in this country, is the right kind of organization to partner on this work,” said Owens.</p>
<p>The ETF, Owens told CNBC, is “the next evolution in our corporate advocacy work around closing the wealth gap for African Americans in this country.&#8221; The Minority Empowerment ETF website features the logo of the NAACP and iconic images from civil rights history.</p>
<p>Owens noted that the fund used a variety of diversity metrics, reflecting the NAACP’s scorecards on corporations, to invest in companies that make &#8220;commitments, public commitments, to standing against racial discrimination.”</p>
<p>Two years later, the NAACP ETF’s largest holdings include Amazon, Tesla, Meta Platforms Inc., Johnson &amp; Johnson, Microsoft Corp., JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., and Nvidia Corp. The holdings are fairly similar to many large- and mid-cap ETFs, such as the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, or VTI, which has the same seven companies among its largest holdings.</p>
<p>The difference, however, is the fee structure. The Minority Empowerment ETF has a fee of 0.49 percent compared with the VTI fee of 0.03 percent, making the NAACP ETF 16 times more expensive for investors. Impact Shares, the plan sponsor that operates the Minority Empowerment ETF, in addition to other thematic ETFs around sustainability and women’s empowerment, says that the excess profits after expense fees are donated back to the NAACP, though it has not made enough fees to transfer any funds to the NAACP yet.</p>
<p>Impact Shares has <a href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/EBSA/laws-and-regulations/rules-and-regulations/public-comments/1210-AB95/00506.pdf">lobbied</a> the federal government to allow retirement plans to be invested with ESG funds. The investment firm wrote to regulators &#8220;on behalf of Impact Shares and our advocacy partners including the NAACP.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked how the ETF fund has impacted racial justice issues, Ethan Powell, the chief executive of Impact Shares, gave Amazon credit for permitting its workers to vote on a union. Amazon, he claimed, engaged in a &#8220;significant shift in company policy&#8221; by allowing workers at its Alabama warehouse &#8220;the opportunity to vote on unionization&#8221; this year.</p>
<p>Labor officials, however, contend that Amazon spent millions of dollars on efforts to derail the union vote and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/07/amazon-illegally-interfered-in-alabama-warehouse-vote-union-alleges.html">engaged</a> in a campaign of intimidation and surveillance against workers suspected of sympathizing with the union — and that the unionization at Amazon was in spite of the company’s efforts, not because of them.</p>
<p>LGBTQ Loyalty Holdings Inc., a company led in part by former Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank, launched the LGBTQ + ESG100 ETF, which invested in large-cap public companies that &#8220;demonstrated a commitment to LGBTQ diversity and inclusion.&#8221; The fund, which wound down earlier this year, had an even higher fee structure of 0.75 percent.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the ESGs largely mirror traditional ETFs, a higher fee structure, typically benefiting investment managers, is common across the board. An analysis from the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tidal-wave-of-esg-funds-brings-profit-to-wall-street-11615887004">found</a> that ESG funds have 43 percent higher fees than widely popular standard index funds.</p>
<p>Fancy, the BlackRock social responsibility CIO turned critic, has argued repeatedly that many ESG funds are virtually identical to existing mutual funds, rebranded as “green” with higher fees. There are almost no discernible differences other than marketing, he has said in a series of <a href="https://medium.com/@sosofancy/the-secret-diary-of-a-sustainable-investor-part-4-epilogue-f18304fd9db7">confessional essays</a> about the nature of ESG.</p>
<p>The notion of investment funds that promote social change without any of the guilt of profiting from capitalism can be alluring. Betterment, a millennial-focused “<a href="https://www.betterment.com/resources/how-robo-advisors-guide-your-investing">robo-advisor</a>” that markets wealth-building strategies, has sponsored <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=all&amp;country=US&amp;q=socially%20responsible%20investing&amp;sort_data[direction]=desc&amp;sort_data[mode]=relevancy_monthly_grouped&amp;search_type=keyword_unordered&amp;media_type=all">Facebook</a> ads <a href="https://www.betterment.com/resources/investing-gender-and-racial-equity-towards-social-change?hsCtaTracking=4e192113-e81f-4a78-a7d9-6d3f835ffb0c%7Cb0e9b592-8682-4ee8-9051-ed6f92c14815">promising</a> racial justice-minded investing. Betterment steers consumers to products such as the NAACP ETF without warning of the high fees or an explanation that many of the holdings are simply traditional large companies that investors would find in ordinary funds.</p>
<p>Asset managers have even worked with public relations firms to co-opt public opinion around social justice movements into inflows of cash to ESG funds. In 2017, at the height of the #MeToo movement, State Street worked with advertising agency McCann New York to create the “Fearless Girl” campaign, which featured a statue of a young woman, with her arms planted defiantly on her hips, that was placed in front of the bronze Charging Bull outside the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>The wildly successful ad campaign, launched the day after International Women’s Day, was designed to advertise State Street’s women-focused SHE ETF, an ESG fund marketed as a vehicle to promote companies with gender diversity on corporate boards. But the corporate beneficiaries of the fund might come as a surprise to retail investors who thought they were supporting the political goals of #MeToo or feminism more broadly. The current SHE ETF holdings include weapons maker Northrop Grumman Corp., fracking giant Pioneer Natural Resources Co., and health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc.</p>
<p>State Street and other fund managers have boasted about the growth of ESG funds as a cash cow. Last December, Gary Shedlin, the chief financial officer at BlackRock, appeared at a conference hosted by Goldman Sachs at the Conrad Hotel in New York to tout the growth of the firm&#8217;s ESG business. BlackRock ESG-related products, he said, had generated over 20 percent new fee growth. In January, BlackRock&#8217;s ESG funds reportedly surged to over $508 billion in managed assets, more than double the previous year.</p>
<p>It’s not just fund managers that are poised to gain from the influx of money into ESG. The trend has been a job creator for accountants, analysts, and other specialty consultants. MSCI, the largest data provider for ESG funds, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1408198/000156459022004803/msci-10k_20211231.htm">disclosed</a> that revenue from its ESG ratings business jumped to $166 million in 2021 from $90 million in 2019.</p>
<p>Both former attorneys general of the Obama administration are now serving as consultants to companies hoping to burnish their credentials as racially progressive. Eric Holder, now with the law firm Covington &amp; Burling, was tapped by Citigroup to conduct its racial equity audit, to review its efforts to close the racial wealth gap. In April, Amazon announced that Loretta Lynch, a partner with Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison, will work for the company to produce a similar report.</p>
<p>And Preet Bharara, the former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, an Obama administration prosecutor turned vocal Trump critic, this month announced his move to become a partner at the law firm WilmerHale. According to reports, he will focus on advising companies on ESG. “Simple-minded criticism of this issue fails to appreciate its complexity and its emerging importance,” Bharara told the New York Times.</p>

But as The Intercept’s review shows, diversity audits and other superficial measures are simply being used to sell investors on the same old funds.</p>
<p>The implication is explicit. Moore &amp; Van Allen, the firm that conducted the racial equity audit on behalf of CoreCivic, noted in an article this year that such audits serve multiple goals, including increased profits and a competitive advantage in a market. The public relations benefits are also clear, the law firm argued. The racial equity audits can lead to a “positive impact on reputation for companies,” partners at the firm wrote.</p>
<p>Placing selective pressure on a few companies won’t work, Damodaran argued, because businesses that voluntarily retreat from one area will be swiftly replaced by less accountable players, such as private equity or hedge funds. If advocates seek better business practices, he said, they should change the law to force compliance instead.</p>

<p>&#8220;These are decisions we should be making as voters, as regulators pushing for change,” said Damodaran. “Instead, we&#8217;ve passed on this responsibility to CEOs and fund managers to make these decisions for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>“The U.S. political sphere is putting optics over substance,” noted Fancy, the former BlackRock executive. “We could do some version of reparations, like a serious investment in Black communities and education and social welfare, but that&#8217;s going to cost a lot of money.” Instead, he said, high-profile Black Americans are elevated onto corporate boards to &#8220;create a marketing narrative&#8221; that helps a small number of elites without substantive change for the public.</p>
<p>One chief executive of a publicly traded company, who asked for anonymity while speaking with The Intercept, said he recently paid around $20,000 to social responsibility consultants in order to produce a special report to submit to ratings agencies. The ESG professionals created a document that dazzled with progress on a number of environmental and racial grounds. The self-reported data isn’t checked by anyone, he noted with a shrug.</p>
<p>The chief executive said that he appears white to most people, but he is technically a quarter nonwhite, making him, for the purposes of ESG, a &#8220;diverse&#8221; CEO — a dynamic he found absurd.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of like the one-drop rule. I’m diverse for the purpose of these rules, they really make no sense,” said the executive, who wondered how asset managers and investors can demand compliance on rules around racial identity when race is socially constructed, not a biological reality.</p>
<p>“We didn’t change any business practices. It’s a charade, yet no one questions this stuff,” he added. “It sounds good, but it doesn’t do anything.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Jeffery Lamar Williams</u> — the celebrated Atlanta trap recording artist better known as Young Thug — walked into Fulton County Jail in May to a standing ovation.</p>
<p>The arrest was an event. The jail, on Rice Street, shut down the intake of other arrestees to process him in. Atlanta’s city-contracted wrecker service diverted all its trucks to haul his many cars out of the rented property in Buckhead where police found him May 9. The entire city paused to take inventory on the massive gang arrest, with 27 other people — including a second superstar rapper, Sergio “Gunna” Kitchens.</p>
<p>Previous Fulton County prosecutors have been reluctant to invoke the law, concerned about the abuses of mass incarceration and its power to stigmatize Black defendants. But Atlanta today faces a rash of violence that distorts policies and murders good intentions.</p>
<p>While official claims about gang culpability for street violence ought to be taken with a grain of salt — such figures are often pulled out of thin air — Young Slime Life, the gang Williams is alleged to lead, left a trail of very real bodies, the victims of a seven-year gang feud.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>Rising violent crime and the abuses attendant to gang prosecutions have received national attention amid the push for criminal justice reform following George Floyd’s murder. Local dynamics in Atlanta make discussions of such reforms — and of the abuses they target — especially fraught. On the one hand, a Black mayor and a Black prosecutor are charged with protecting poor Black people in Black neighborhoods, while white conservatives use Atlanta violence as a political punching bag. On the other hand, the machinery of rap music in Atlanta increasingly exploits real-world violence to promote the street “authenticity” of Atlanta trap, primarily to white audiences.</p>
<p>In the middle are austere jail cells, where Young Thug and many others now wait for their trials.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[1] -->
<p><u>Violence is on</u> the rise in Atlanta. The homicide rate is up by about one-third year-to-date and about 60 percent over pre-pandemic levels. The city is on pace for roughly 170 murders this year, compared with <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/crime/atlanta-no-3-for-highest-homicide-jump-during-covid-study-finds/HW37L6IMM5BFZLWH7DP6TZJSRI/">99 in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>The problem, as can be gleaned from police reports, appears to be terrifyingly basic: The cops increasingly describe killings as targeted. A small subset of shooters want to make sure their victims aren’t just bleeding but dead.</p>
<p>Sometimes that can look like the casually brutal murder of Anthony Frazier, a security guard at a seafood restaurant on Cleveland Avenue who took a bullet point-blank in the back of the head last month. Or it can be a plain hit, like the murder of Shymel Drinks, whose body was found beneath an overpass just south of downtown in March. Police described him as a member of a gang, allegedly killed by rivals in Young Slime Life as an act of reprisal.</p>
<p>This is what Atlanta’s gang war looks like. It has been raging in varying forms since 2015 and went into overdrive during the pandemic, reversing more than a decade of the city’s gains against violence.</p>
<p>“The murder rate in Atlanta is over the murder rate in Chicago!” bellowed Republican former Sen. David Perdue in a gubernatorial candidates’ debate in April. “What we have in Georgia is a runaway crime situation that the governor is burying his head about. &#8230; We have the highest murder rate in the country!”</p>
<p>Atlanta’s murder rate over the last 12 months is higher than Chicago’s: 36 per 100,000 people killed to Chicago’s 27 per 100,000. None of the rest of what Perdue said is true. Atlanta doesn’t crack the top 20 cities over 100,000 residents for murders. Georgia isn’t in the top 10 states for murder rates. Kemp still engaged in a bidding war for “tough-on-crime” credentials.</p>
<p>The rhetoric from white conservatives has had one of its intended effects: blunting reform efforts. Atlanta’s relatively progressive, Black political leadership has incrementally turned away from talk about reform and toward whatever can get the body count down, now.<br />

<u>Fani Willis,</u> the Fulton County district attorney, sees gang prosecutions and state RICO charges as the answer to the uptick in violence. RICO — short for the<strong> </strong>Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act — is a law meant to take down drug cartels and mafia syndicates by piecing together individual crimes to argue that they’re part of a larger criminal enterprise. RICO cases — state or federal — are hard to beat.</p>
<p>The Young Slime Life, or YSL, indictment has 28 defendants, only a handful of whom can pay for a robust defense out of pocket. The wide net of the charges is designed to get people to fold and offer testimony to save their own skin.</p>
<p>Not everyone is convinced that it’s a good tactic.</p>
<p>“This sweeping indictment will come at a great expense to taxpayers and all Atlantans who would prefer violence intervention and thoughtful investment in solutions proven to be effective,” said Devin Franklin, an attorney at the Southern Center for Human Rights. “The Fulton County District Attorney’s Office has invested tremendously in crafting a narrative of dangerousness in Atlanta without providing data to the public substantiating the contention that so-called repeat offenders are primarily to blame for harm in Atlanta.”</p>
<p>Some critics hold that the targets in this case are Black people who have risen from poverty, that perhaps the charges are a prosecutorial overreach in the face of political pressure to act. These critics would argue that RICO cases should be reserved for people with institutional power, like transnational criminal cartels, mafia crews, and corporate malefactors.</p>

<p>There might be something to it, but to make that argument one must overlook the role of the music industry in Atlanta — an institution, one might say — and its intertwined relationship with the gang violence. Should Black criminal enterprises be immune to drawing a RICO charge? The idea is fundamentally insulting. Poor Black people’s lives lost in street warfare deserve the protection of the law.</p>
<p>When looking at the problem of street violence and its connection to Atlanta’s music industry as a question of racism, consider the corporate parentage of Young Thug’s label. Len Blavatnik is the owner of Warner Music Group, which owns the 300 Entertainment label that distributes the music of Young Thug on his YSL label. Blavatnik is a British-American <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c1889f48-871a-11e9-a028-86cea8523dc2">billionaire</a> born in the former Soviet Union, in what is now Ukraine, who <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-06-03/len-blavatnik-net-worth-quiet-billionaire-separates-fortune-from-russian-money">made his fortune</a> in the Russian fossil fuel and natural resource industries and later <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/2019-01-29.EEC%20Wyden%20to%20Mnuchin-Treasury%20re%20Deripaska%20Sanctions.pdf">helped</a> other oligarchs under sanctions <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/defending-the-united-states-against-russian-dark-money/">divest</a> their holdings. He donated $1 million to former President Donald Trump&#8217;s slush fund/inaugural committee.</p>
<p>If Atlanta’s musical infrastructure is cancerous because of the way street gangs are using their connection to music studios and recording executives to recruit new members into acts of violence, a RICO prosecution is an attack on structural power.</p>
<p><u>Young Thug’s rise</u> to stardom ran in parallel with a gang war between feuding sets of Bloods. The conflict erupted in 2015, following the assassination of Bloods gang leader Donovan “Peanut” Thomas. Prosecutors allege that Williams — Young Thug — rented the car used by five gang members, including rising rap star Yak Gotti, to conduct the drive-by shooting that killed Thomas.</p>
<p>According to the indictment, Williams spoke with Kyle Oree, the leader of the cultlike gang Sex Money Murda, shortly after Thomas’s death. Prosecutors appear to have captured a call to Oree in jail, in which the hit is purportedly discussed. A few days after talking to Oree, Young Thug went on social media to argue that people who “get right into the courtroom and tell the God’s honest truth don’t get it, y’all n****s need to get fucking killed, bro, from me and YSL.”</p>
<p>Bringing charges against a group like the Young Slime Life gang proved challenging. Prosecutors had to disentangle YSL the music label, which is an imprint of Warner Music, from YSL the street gang, an outgrowth of South Atlanta organized crime around Cleveland Avenue, the latest iteration of previous gangs like Raised on Cleveland and 30 Deep.</p>
<p>Thomas’s murder divided Atlanta into two warring camps: YSL and YFN, another Blood gang in Atlanta loyal to Thomas. YFN is fronted by another popular rapper, Rayshawn Bennett, known as YFN Lucci.</p>
<p>The conflict only accelerated during the pandemic, though violence appears to have slowed down since the May 9 indictment and arrests.</p>
<p>Lucci is in Fulton County Jail — somewhere carefully isolated from Young Thug — awaiting trial on gang charges and a felony murder charge from a botched 2021 drive-by shooting on YSL gang members. Lucci allegedly drove the car. When their targets killed the triggerman in return fire, Lucci ditched the body in the middle of the street and sped away, the YFN gang indictment said.<br />

The arrest of alleged YSL gang member Christian “Big Bhris” Eppinger on February 7 ended in a bloody affair, with Eppinger allegedly firing six shots into an Atlanta cop during the arrest. Eppinger’s arrest started a 90-day clock ticking, with court rules demanding an indictment before then to continue to hold him. Willis, the district attorney, used it to build the broader YSL gang case.</p>
<p>The cases are sure to leverage Georgia’s unique gang law. Normally, prosecutors can’t use rap lyrics or Instagram photos of men holding guns while throwing up gang signs as evidence of a crime in an armed robbery case or an assault, because alone these things have nothing to do with those crimes. A judge would consider it improperly prejudicial.</p>
<p>But in a gang terrorism case under Georgia law, the prosecution has to prove that other crimes were committed as part of gang activity. So all evidence of gang activity becomes admissible, and that evidence can be used in the trials of all the other alleged gang members charged under the same statute. The Georgia law can be devastating for the defense: Juries see mountains of evidence from a wide array of crimes, along with testimony about gang signs and initiations.</p>
<p><u>Police and civic</u> leaders began 2022 with calls for Atlantans to engage in nonviolent conflict resolution, because the city’s murders appeared to be driven by inexplicable spontaneous rage and not, say, the more statistically predictable drug deal gone bad or robbery attempt.</p>
<p>“I mean, folks are going to the finality of any argument, like the end of the argument is to end you, to end your life,” said Andre Dickens, Atlanta’s newly elected mayor, at a “Clippers and Cops” barbershop forum in January. “We’re finding that the person that’s dead also had a gun. So the person that shot was thinking, ‘I’ve got to shoot you before you shoot me,’ because so many people have guns right now.” He added, “A lot of times I’m seeing these things happening because people just don’t know how to settle a dispute — without going to a gun.”</p>
<p>Historically, Atlanta voters have picked their mayors based on issues of housing, transportation, and city service problems. A poll ahead of the Atlanta mayor’s race last year, though, showed that 48 percent of people considered crime to be the most important problem in the city, with about 61 percent of respondents saying they live within a mile of an area where they’d be afraid to walk alone at night.</p>

<p>On the campaign trail, Dickens took a balanced approach to fighting Atlanta’s growing crime problem. “While arrests for violent criminals are of course necessary, we simply cannot arrest our way out of a crime wave,” he said in his crime policy platform. “We need a comprehensive approach. Diversion and police alternatives are an integral part of managing Atlanta’s criminal justice system.”</p>
<p>The city is pursuing an expansion of its pre-arrest diversion initiative, ramping up its new Office of Violence Reduction, and planning to create a hospital-based violence intervention program at Grady Memorial. The early days of Dickens’s term, however, have largely focused on enforcement.</p>
<p>After three months in office, Dickens announced the creation of a repeat offenders unit in the police department to identify people most likely to commit an act of violence and get them off the street. The unit will direct citizen reviewers to follow the cases of recidivists, documenting the trials and reporting on the outcomes.</p>
<p>The worries about creating a stigma had been overcome by the politics of the crime surge.</p>
<p><u>Rap is still art,</u> and artistic freedom is a hallmark of the First Amendment, said Devin Rafus, a criminal defense attorney at Arora Law. “Young men use lyrics and rap as a way to express their feelings, or how the community is growing up, or what they see on the street, and how to sort of break free from it,” he said. “To use that against someone in the future, and try and say, ‘Hey, you must be bad, or you must have committed this crime,’ because you talked about either committing a crime that’s similar or something totally different that&#8217;s bad as well. It’s just very prejudicial to a jury and to the defendant when they hear that information.”</p>
<p>“The statutes are stacked against us,” Rafus said. “I don&#8217;t think that just because someone writes a song, that that necessarily makes it true either then or in the future.”</p>

<p>That argument, though, has so far fallen flat in court. Deamonte “Yak Gotti” Kendrick’s lawyer made the connection between the case and the music plain in his ultimately unsuccessful argument for bond.</p>
<p>“They’re sending a message to every young kid today in the city who hopes to grow up and become a successful musician that whenever you go on YouTube and the internet and create as your art form, you’re going to have that used against you later,” Jay Abt, Kendrick’s lawyer, said. “And that is a shame on them. That is one of the greatest things that has blessed our city and our community and our state in the last two decades.”</p>
<p>The defense insists that this prosecution means to put rap on trial, and the aspirations of poor Black people who see music as the only way out of poverty along with it. They are arguing that Willis would prefer not to face the same fate as <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/06/03/san-francisco-chesa-boudin-recall/">Chesa Boudin</a> in San Francisco, cast out amid a perceived failure to be tough on crime.</p>
<p>The larger question is whether gang prosecutions tied to the music industry ultimately begin looking for targets in the music industry’s corporate penthouses. There are rich people at the top of this pyramid who are white, not from Atlanta, and profiting from Black misery, arguably being cultivated by these artists, in the name of selling records.</p>
<p>At some point, we must ask if the major labels are deliberately looking to promote artists who are themselves promoting violent street gangs because, in a fractured media landscape, “authentic” trap musicians are more reliably profitable.</p>

<p><u>Just before the</u> House January 6 committee’s dramatic hearing on Thursday on former President Donald Trump’s efforts to use the Justice Department to overturn the 2020 election, the FBI raided the Virginia home of Jeffrey Clark, the former Justice Department official who worked most closely with Trump to try to keep him in power.</p>
<p>The FBI raid was overshadowed by the subsequent hearing, during which Clark’s efforts to conspire with Trump were laid bare. But the raid is significant because it provides a tentative sign that the Justice Department may finally be conducting a criminal investigation of Trump and his allies for their attempt to stage a coup.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->
<p>Until recently, the Justice Department’s investigation of the January 6 insurrection seemed to be focused on the individuals who were part of the mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol to try to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 presidential election. Federal prosecutors handed out modest charges to many of those low-level rioters, leading to criticism that Attorney General Merrick Garland was not going after the powerful people responsible for actually inciting the insurrection.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[2](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[2] -->
<p>But in early June, prosecutors charged the leader of the Proud Boys and other members of the white nationalist extremist group with seditious conspiracy — the first sign that Garland and the Justice Department were beginning to move against the leadership of the insurrection. Now, the raid on Clark’s house suggests that the Justice Department has expanded its investigation beyond January 6, in order to investigate the repeated attempts by Trump and his allies throughout the transition period between November 2020 and January 2021 to try to illegally overturn the election.</p>
<p>The evidence of a broader Justice Department investigation comes as the House January 6 committee has far exceeded expectations for its public hearings, uncovering damning evidence of the lengths that Trump was willing to go to stay in power. The hearings have turned into something like a nationally televised criminal referral to the Justice Department. It would be difficult for Garland not to take action in the face of the facts disclosed in the House hearings.</p>
<p>If a criminal conspiracy case is to be developed against Trump, gathering evidence from and about Clark would be a good place to start.</p>
<p>Clark is a conservative Washington, D.C. lawyer who has bounced between law firms, government jobs, and right-wing activism. After representing BP in connection with the Deepwater Horizon disaster, he joined the Trump Justice Department as assistant attorney general for the environmental and natural resources division, where he sought to delay bringing charges against a pipeline operator in North Dakota for a wastewater spill.</p>
<p>Clark was a total Trump loyalist, willing to do anything to help the president stay in power. In the midst of Trump’s frantic efforts to overturn the election, Clark was eager for Trump to fire acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and then take over himself at the Justice Department. Once he was in charge, he planned to issue a letter to state officials in Georgia claiming, falsely, that the Justice Department had found evidence of election fraud and recommending that the Georgia state legislature should be called into special session to reopen the whole debate about who won the presidential election there. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/06/23/us/jeffrey-clark-draft-letter.html">unsent letter</a> was filled with lies; the Justice Department had no evidence of election fraud. Trump had repeatedly been told by senior Justice officials that they had no such evidence, and Clark certainly had to know that as well.</p>
<p>Trump nearly fired Rosen and named Clark to run the Justice Department, and testimony from former Justice Department officials at Thursday’s hearing revealed that Trump was talked out of it only after a marathon meeting at the White House in which Rosen and other senior Justice Department officials told Trump that there was no evidence of fraud and warned Trump that there would be mass resignations at the Justice Department if he installed Clark.</p>
<p>Eric Herschmann, a lawyer who worked for Trump, told the House committee that he had warned Clark that if he took over at the Justice Department and sent the letter to Georgia officials, he would be guilty of a crime. That may explain the FBI raid on Clark’s home, where the Justice Department’s case against Trump may begin. Are Trump and Clark guilty of a “seditious conspiracy” a couple levels up from the Proud Boys?</p>
