					<h1>Welcome, Dark Web Traveler</h1>
					<p>You have entered the abode of the <strong>Singing_Sailing_Man</strong>, a peaceful Dark Web territory of random odds and ends I find of intrigue and value. Be sure to bookmark this page in your TOR browser of choice and check back often. It's updated with interesting new information and links as I find them.</p>

		<h2>My Current Status</h2>
		"Now no one can pay rеnt, 'cause they can't afford to live thеre. A playground for the one-percent, so put the middle class on welfare. Just pour the sparkling wine, ignore the burning pines. You sold our birthrights, but you made a couple dollar signs."<br />

		<h2>Zero Tolerance Content Policy</h2>
		<p>While the Dark Web may normally be known as a hub of basement dwelling bottom-feeders, rest assured, you won't find their rubbish on this site. Below are a few things I have zero-tolerance for. If you're looking for this kind of content, delete this bookmark and scram. This spot isn't for you.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>CSAM, also sometimes referred to as "child porn" or "CP". If you're into this, please get help immediately.</li>
			<li>Oppression of widows, orphans, and strangers.</li>
			<li>Racism. Both of the hard-right immigrant hating kind, and hard-left wokester kind. Don't be an idiot.</li>
			<li>Any and all forms of real-life violence that isn't in explicit self-defence. Life is precious. Period. Act like it.</li>
		</ul>

		You (my website visitor) and I are but two ships passing in the night. May we show each other common grace, solidarity, and good will as we go about our journey on this Dark Web.
