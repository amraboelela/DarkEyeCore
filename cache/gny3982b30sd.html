<p>
This is a collection of notes on the &quot;This War of Mine&quot; game.
</p>

</div>

<h1 class="sectionedit2" id="survivor_team">Survivor Team</h1>
<div class="level1">

<p>
The game is not balanced in regards to survivors and perhaps intentionally so since survivors are chosen at random per default upon each playthrough - it might be a &quot;dream team&quot; or a &quot;calamity&quot; depending on which survivors are chosen.
</p>

</div>

<h2 class="sectionedit3" id="traits">Traits</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
The &quot;dream team&quot; could be summarized as:
</p>
<div class="table sectionedit4"><table class="inline">
	<thead>
	<tr class="row0">
		<th class="col0"> Name </th><th class="col1"> Explanation </th>
	</tr>

		<td class="col0"> <code>Boris</code> (alt. <code>Marko</code>) </td><td class="col1"> Compared to no other survivors, <code>Boris</code> has 17 inventory slots and <code>Marko</code> has 15. The tradeoff between <code>Boris</code> and <code>Marko</code> is that <code>Boris</code> has an addiction and is noisy whilst looting whereas <code>Marko</code> has no addiction and is faster implicitly (baseline noise generation) yet quantity matters way more such that 2 extra inventory slots are preferable to an addiction (that can be hampered via other means) and being noisy during scavenging (that may not matter in various scenarios). </td>
	</tr>
	<tr class="row2">
		<td class="col0"> <code>Anton</code> </td><td class="col1"> <code>Anton</code> speeds up the rat traps thereby reaping food faster and food is the most crucial to survival. No booze, no puff-puff just slow and only 8 slots - the ideal shelter hermit that can be on guard duty every night! <img src="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/lib/images/smileys/icon_smile.gif" class="icon" alt=":-)" /> </td>

		<td class="col0"> <code>Zlata</code> (alt. <code>Katia</code>) </td><td class="col1"> <code>Zlata</code> is the best guitar player and can provide massive boosts to morale even hampering addiction side-effects of the other survivors. <code>Katia</code> is a good alternative, also playing guitar (but with an addiction to coffee that can be self-hampered via the guitar) with an additional extra bargaining skill (however, <code>Katia</code> has only 12 inventory slots compared to <code>Boris</code> or <code>Marko</code> such that she will never be the primary choice for scavenging and might therefore only reach the default trader knocking on the shelter door every three days; other vendors/traders on the map will provide some awesome loot that <code>Katia</code> might miss out on). </td>

However, after the <code>Crude Stove</code> has been upgraded (and this can be done after 10 days or so) the only benefit from the <code>Good Cook</code> trait is just 1 less <code>Water</code> being used when cooking. The <code>Good Cook</code> benefits are maximized for medication, alcohol and tobacco but <code>Livia</code> also has the <code>Good Cook</code> trait. Also, <code>Bruno</code> only has 10 inventory slots. <code>Bruno</code> is addicted to smoking meaning that he will intermittently have a <code>Sad</code> status even with a good guitar player around. Not even being a guard during nighttime is a good activity for <code>Bruno</code> because of the other statuses inherent to his character that will mess him up beyond rescue very quickly.   </td>

Perhaps in the <code>The Little Ones</code> expansion she might have some use, otherwise, she is, at best, good for perpetual guard duty during nighttime. </td>

Baseline 12 inventory slots providing sidekick scavenging if need be. Worst but still effective guitar player. A little whim is provided by his <code>Fast Runner</code> making him the fastest running survivor in the game - faster moving inside the shelter to get activities done and good when acting as a sidekick scavenger. <code>Pavle</code> can play guitar during daytime and guard efficiently during the night if not acting as a sidekick scavenger. </td>
	</tr>
</table></div>

</div>

<h2 class="sectionedit7" id="size">Size</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
The game mechanics restrict scavenging to a single survivor such as all the other survivors will have to either sleep or guard during nighttime. 
</p>

<p>
Since only a single survivor can scavenge, the ideal team size seem to be three survivors such that, during nighttime:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> one survivor is scavenging, </div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> one survivor is guarding, </div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> one survivor is resting in bed</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Depending on survivor traits, a fourth team member may be redundant and, given proper morale remedy solutions, can even be killed off (ie: by making them guard all the time during nighttime till they die). 
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, keeping a fourth survivor around with an useless trait that may additionally be addicted to alcohol or tobacco is just one more mouth to feed and a person to take care of.
</p>

</div>

<h1 class="sectionedit8" id="managing_characters">Managing Characters</h1>
<div class="level1">

<p>
Depending on whether survivors are scavenging, at home in the shelter during daytime or at home during nighttime there are a few observations to mind.
</p>

</div>

<h2 class="sectionedit9" id="scavenging">Scavenging</h2>
<div class="level2">
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> trivial, but making a scavenger take an item with them when going scavenging will ensure that the item cannot be stolen during a raid back at the shelter,</div>
</li>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> the highest priority when scavenging is to, in order:</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> clear piles of rubble - once a pile of rubble is cleared, a survivor can return and pick up whatever was blocked by the pile. Clearing piles of rubble should be a priority even to exploration since it takes a long time to clear rubble piles without a shovel.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> when scavenging an area, do not loot the first pile you find but rather loot all the other piles, bring the loot back to the first pile and dump all the inventory inside the first pile. Any extra time available during scavenging should be used to dump stuff into the very first pile. Keeping the first pile has several advantages, implicitly, given the game invariants:</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> the very first pile is the easiest, least risky and takes the shortest amount of time to reach (trivial, given that scavenging is limited from 9pm to about 4am and that the scavenger is placed at the entrance upon entering the area),</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> piles do not have an inventory limit (but a scavenger does) such that all items will be sorted and organized into proper stacks inside the first pile,</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> easier to remember what the area contains when re-visiting since it is much easier to remember a single pile than loot spread out in a certain area</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> as an addendum to the former, during certain events regarding shortages, loot piles will have certain inventory types removed and in order to work around this issue one speculative solution is to dump the scavenger&#039;s inventory right away without maintaining one of the game-provided piles - it seems that when a survivor dumps its inventory on the floor, it is not accounted for by the game as an official pile of loot but will still be persistent when a survivor re-enters the area</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> note that dumping inventory on the floor in an area will not make the loot register on the area selection on the map when preparing to scavenge but the loot is still there</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h2 class="sectionedit10" id="at_home_during_daytime">At Home during Daytime</h2>
<div class="level2">
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> <strong>all</strong> characters should be resting in bed unless they have no <code>Tired</code> status,</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> a survivor that returns from scavenging should be put to bed right away since their <code>Tired</code> status will clear in about an hour&#039;s time leaving plenty of time to perform other activities</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> characters that have the <code>Illness</code> or <code>Wounded</code> statuses can and should be used preferably to characters that have the <code>Tired</code> status in order to accomplish tasks during the daytime because the <code>Illness</code> and <code>Wounded</code> statuses progress only during nighttime (if the characters are not resting in bed)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> iff. a guitar is available and any of the following characters are available and additionally the characters do not have a <code>Tired</code> status, then, in order of preference: <code>Zlata</code>, <code>Roman</code>, <code>Katia</code>, <code>Arica</code> or <code>Pavle</code> should play the guitar during the whole day in order to provide a very good morale boost.</div>
</li>

<div class="level1">
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> At the start of the game and for a very long while, players should never trade for <code>components</code> and <code>wood</code> because both are available in droves in all areas such that trading valuable materials for them is pointless - perhaps in case of a quick emergency in the shelter when being 1 item short.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> After all areas have been entirely looted of easily accessible <code>components</code> and <code>wood</code> (this might take a month or so), the best person to trade <code>wood</code> with will be <code>Franko</code>, a trader that appears at the shelter.

</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> The <code>Hospital</code> provides free healing to survivors ailed by either <code>Illness</code> or <code>Wounded</code> statuses but also provides double the healing - the debuffs step back two levels when being healed by a nurse at the <code>Hospital</code>.

</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <code>Electrical Components</code> and <code>Parts</code> (gears) should always be bought from traders: <code>Electrical Components</code> are considered rare and are very difficult to come by (compared to <code>components</code> or <code>wood</code>) whilst <code>Parts</code> (gears) are also difficult to find aplenty.</div>

</ul>

</div>

<h1 class="sectionedit15" id="early_building_plan">Early Building Plan</h1>
<div class="level1">

<p>
Due to other game invariants, it seems that a build plan can be established that seems quite invariant by itself and provides the best stability in the long run. In order of priority, the following should be built:
</p>
<div class="table sectionedit16"><table class="inline">
	<thead>
	<tr class="row0">
		<th class="col0"> Item </th><th class="col1"> Explanation </th>
	</tr>
	</thead>
	<tr class="row1">
		<td class="col0"> 2 x <code>Rat Cage</code> </td><td class="col1"> Two rat cages will provide survivors with the default source of nourishment throughout the entire game. There is no building more important than building two rat cages as soon as the game starts. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr class="row2">
		<td class="col0"> <code>Bed</code> for all survivors </td><td class="col1"> Survivors can rest during daytime as well as nighttime. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr class="row3">
		<td class="col0"> <code>Workshop</code> </td><td class="col1"> The workshop will provide a crowbar at first. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr class="row4">
		<td class="col0"> <code>Crowbar</code> </td><td class="col1"> A <code>Crowbar</code> is imperative to have early on in the game in order to maximize the amount of loot scavenged. <code>Shovels</code> are nice but a survivor can clear out rubbles easily when scavenging in exchange for some wasted time. <code>Lockpicks</code> are only useful later on in order to avoid detection and even then a <code>Crowbar</code> can be a good substitute. </td>
	</tr>
</table></div>

<p>
In case two rat cages have not been built after the above has been built then the player should not progress and instead amass the sufficient resources to build a rat cage.
</p>

<p>
<strong>TL;DR</strong>: the secret to self-sufficiency is building the rat cages early on in the game.  
</p>

</div>

<h2 class="sectionedit17" id="mid_to_late_building_plan">Mid to Late Building Plan</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
There is no mid to late building plan - most of the other structures that a player can build are either too costly to outweigh the gains. 
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the most advanced structure with the maximal benefits would be an upgraded <code>Herb Garden</code> that can produce vegetables. However, even the vegetable plant is very costly in terms of gains:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> it takes 72 hours (3 days!) in order to harvest just 4 vegetables,</div>
</li>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> the vegetable plant relies on water and food (or fertilizer):</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> water relies on filters (during winter, water relies on scooping snow, a filter and additionally fuel!),</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> food is a commodity that is usually rare and with a high trade value (perhaps coupled with rat traps),</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> fertilizer is also hard to come by and there are not many opportunities</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
All the other structures can be used to produce medicine, booze or tobacco - unfortunately, the requirements are sky high with a mediocre sell price; except medicine, but in order to create proper medicine, <code>Pure Alcohol</code> is needed which involves the rainwater collector for water, <code>Moonshine</code>, the <code>Distiller</code> and a bunch of other resources that does not make the effort worthwhile.
</p>

<p>
It seems that the player can survive blissfully with just the following structures (even if the player will miss out on a large chunk of the game mechanics):
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> two <code>Rat Cage</code>s,</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> as many <code>Beds</code> as there are survivors,</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> <code>Workshop</code> - upgraded only once, because trading at the <code>Garage</code> will obtain tools much cheaper (ie: to create a <code>Hatchet</code>, the workshop needs <code>Components</code> and one <code>Part</code> (gears) and <code>Parts</code> are fairly rare such that just buying a <code>Hatchet</code> is perhaps the better option),</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> one fully upgraded <code>Stove</code> (uses less fuel),</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> one fully upgraded <code>Heater</code> (uses less fuel, allegedly) - perhaps two, in case it gets too cold in winter,</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> a <code>Radio</code>,</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> a <code>Rainwater Collector</code></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> fully boarded up shelter and a <code>Reinforced Door</code></div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
and, at most:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> an upgraded <code>Herb Garden</code> to <code>Vegetable Garden</code></div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
All the rest seems superfluous and is contrary to the claims made by the game:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> cigarettes and alcohol do not trade that well by contrast with medicine,</div>
</li>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> medicine can be looted in many ways from a trader&#039;s chest that replenishes every few days,</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> additionally, survivors can be healed at the hospital for no charge and for double the effect compared to any <code>Bandage</code> or <code>Medicine</code>!</div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> the herbal medicine seems to be worthless - by definition, herbal medicine is meant to be used only in the early stages of illness and is otherwise useless</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The time spent perpetually accumulating resources for alcohol and tobacco, combined with the long waiting times for various structures to complete production makes this venture by and large unprofitable.
</p>

</div>

<h1 class="sectionedit18" id="weapons">Weapons</h1>
<div class="level1">

<p>
The power of a <code>Knife</code> carved after the first upgrade of the <code>Workshop</code> should not be underestimated. Apparently, having as many knives as there are survivors on guard or sleeping at home is sufficient to complete the game.
</p>

<p>
The problem with weapons is that, just like alcohol and tobacco, weapons are just too costly to be profitable and are counter-intuitively in conflict with the mechanics of the game that rely on the player to be of a &quot;good&quot; alignment. Killing people, in general, deals massive morale blows to everyone short of making them <code>Broken</code>, as per the game term, and having them skip turns. It is strange that there exists such an elaborate gun crafting mechanic when the players cannot really have fun with them.
</p>

<p>
To create a simple gun, the following abbreviated procedure has to take effect:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> find a &quot;broken&quot; gun (this is quite rare, either by stealing, or in dangerous areas),</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> upgrade the <code>Workshop</code> fully (oh my <code>components</code>, <code>wood</code> and <code>parts</code>),</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> find <code>gunpowder</code>,</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> find <code>shells</code></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> use the <code>gunpowder</code> and <code>shells</code> to make bullets (yes, one at a time) or buy them (also, very rare),</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> finally craft your gun</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> ... get owned by snipers?</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Also make sure to repeat all the above for a <code>Shotgun</code> - except the gunpowder that is common to all weapons.
</p>

<p>
Given the above and in principle, the best idea is to completely skip the gun crafting system (too bad, another large chunk of the game gone), and craft a single <code>Knife</code> instead. Take the <code>Knife</code> to the <code>Construction Site</code> and obtain the <code>Large Scoped Sniper</code> which is the most lethal arm in the game (aims like a sniper, deals as much damage as a shotgun at close range).
</p>

<p>
In fact, do not even bother with the best weapon in the game: craft a single <code>Knife</code>, make a survivor equip the <code>Knife</code> that can insta-kill a target and go to the <code>Supermarket</code>. Once there, rescue the girl by backstabbing the solider (at no morale cost!) and obtain an assault rifle plus sufficient bullets to defend your shelter till the end of the game.
</p>

<p>
Naturally, a player may wish to explore the game by getting involved in various sorts of activities, however that is not a requirement for survival and completing the game.
</p>

</div>

<h1 class="sectionedit19" id="helping_neighbors">Helping Neighbors</h1>
<div class="level1">

<p>
Due to the game design, helping neighbors boosts morale but morale is easily remedied via the two following methods:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> making a guitar and having, in order of preference: <code>Zlata</code>, <code>Roman</code>, <code>Katia</code>, <code>Arica</code> or <code>Pavle</code> play the guitar during the daytime.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> building a radio (maybe, but unconfirmed, setting the radio station to a music channel)</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Contrary to other suggestions, the most efficient approach, given that the above props are available, is to not help neighbors by not even answering the door. Neighbors will knock on your door and just listening to their monologue will allow the player to determine whether they are:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> asking for help,</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> trader (trader arrives every 3 days),</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> wanting to give the player something.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Simply open the door to the trader and when people want to give you something - there is no penalty for not helping people (by not opening the door) but the player will not get a morale boost and if a morale boost is not necessary, then it is best not to bother.
</p>

<p>
Apathy saves penalties to morale. :)
</p>

<p>
<strong>TL;DR</strong>: helping people knocking on your door does not provide any benefit except a morale boost (that can be compensated for).
</p>

</div>

<h1 class="sectionedit20" id="beds_and_sleeping">Beds and Sleeping</h1>
<div class="level1">

<p>
Contrary to other suggestions, it is imperative to build the exact number of beds as survivors under the player&#039;s control. That is, on a 3-survivor playthrough, build 3 beds (on a 4-survivor playthrough, build 4 beds, etc.).
</p>

<p>
There are two distinctive uses for beds depending on whether it is daytime or nighttime and both during daytime and nighttime players should use the beds with all characters.
</p>

</div>

<h2 class="sectionedit21" id="daytime">Daytime</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
An interesting trick that seems to work wonderfully is to immediately put all characters to bed at the start of the day for a nap. Taking a nap during the day, seems to last just a few hours and all the characters will have their &quot;Tired&quot; status removed. With the &quot;Tired&quot; status removed, either accumulated during the nighttime whilst guarding or due to scavenging, there is still plenty of time during the rest of the day to get things done.
</p>

<p>
<strong>TL;DR</strong>: at the start of the day, tuck every character in their beds and let them rest till their &quot;Tired&quot; status is gone (it only takes an hour or so).
</p>

</div>

<h2 class="sectionedit22" id="nighttime">Nighttime</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
Once a <code>Reinforced Door</code> is built, all game characters can sleep assured in beds that the door will wake them up during the raid because the <code>Reinforced Door</code> has an alarm. This has the benefit of allowing characters to recover from <code>Illness</code> or <code>Wounded</code> whilst still being able to fend off raiders.
</p>

<p>
<strong>TL;DR</strong>: every character remaining at home can sleep in a bed if the <code>Reinforced Door</code> is built.
</p>

</div>

<h1 class="sectionedit23" id="addictions">Addictions</h1>
<div class="level1">

<p>
Certain characters have addictions such as smoking or alcoholism. Neither of these addictions have to be satisfied and the morale penalty can be compensated by:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> making a guitar and having, in order of preference: <code>Zlata</code>, <code>Roman</code>, <code>Katia</code>, <code>Arica</code> or <code>Pavle</code> play the guitar during the daytime.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> building a radio (maybe, but unconfirmed, setting the radio station to a music channel)</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The effect will still be there such that a character like <code>Boris</code> will still have the <code>Sad</code> status but its evolution will be hampered by regularly playing the guitar or listening to the radio. In any case, compensating for additions is much better than wasting resources to craft valuable and highly sought-after commodities such as alcohol and tobacco that can be sold off for good bargains.
</p>

</div>

<h1 class="sectionedit24" id="seasons">Seasons</h1>
<div class="level1">

<p>
Various seasons require specific gameplay styles from the player in order to survive them.
</p>

</div>

<h2 class="sectionedit25" id="the_outbreak_of_crime">The Outbreak of Crime</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
During this season, raids will happen almost every day such that it would be ideal to board up the shelter completely including a <code>Reinforced Door</code>. Similarly, <code>Knives</code> will suffice to fend of raiders but having a gun and some ammo may make this stage much easier. Otherwise, nothing should change and each day one survivor should go scavenging whilst the others either rest in beds or guard.
</p>

</div>

<h2 class="sectionedit26" id="winter">Winter</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
During winter, rainwater cannot be filtered into water such that the survivors will have to either rely on stacks of water obtained before winter or scoop up snow and melt it in the stove with an additional filter aside the fuel required to power the stove. Additionally, the low temperatures will make all survivors sick and will eventually freeze them to death if no heating is used. Finally, all loot that is to be found outside buildings in every single location turns to dust and track such that looting during winter is more difficult.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, winter does not last that long and it suffices to trade for materials that can be turned into fuel such as <code>components</code> and <code>wood</code>, rely on the rat traps to produce the required food and perhaps scoop up a bit of snow to produce the required water to cook.
</p>

</div>

<h2 class="sectionedit27" id="ceasefire">Ceasefire</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
Shortly after winter, international intervention takes place and the survivors are meant to survive approximately at most two weeks.
</p>

<p>
By now, all survivors would have ended up with a completely obliterated morale (expect a few of them to be <code>Broken</code> and unable to perform actions) such that some chit-chat between the survivors is advisable to at least attempt to get them within manageable levels (ie: <code>Sad</code>).
</p>

<p>
Incidentally, after winter, most of the map locations open up such that the hospital is available again and will provide free healing for any scavenging survivor.
</p>

<p>
The main strategy here is: attempt to redress the survivors&#039; moods by making them interact with each other, playing the guitar, ensuring that the radio is on, ferry survivors afflicted by <code>Illness</code> or <code>Wounded</code> to the hospital in order to obtain free treatment whilst waiting for <code>Franko</code>, the trader, to arrive at the shelter (in days that are multiples of three; just add up the day digits and make sure that the single digit is a multiple of 3 such as 3, 6, 9).
</p>

<p>
Occasionally, if low on fuel, the <code>Garage</code> is a place that is easy to steal from and will periodically resupply the trader&#039;s locker - remember however that stealing will result again in a penalty to morale. If enough fuel is available to ride the cold out, then bunkering up completely in the shelter might be a better option.
</p>

<p>
Since the game cannot progress after day <code>46</code>, with the game ending even sooner than <code>46</code> days depending on the initial survivor team, all the accumulated loot will serve no purpose! Feel free to throw away rare sniper rifles, rare electronic components and whatever else that may allow the player to obtain food, fuel and water from the trader.
</p>

<p>
<strong>TL;DR</strong>: it&#039;s over man, game over; trade away all your rare and precious loot in order to buy the essentials because you will not have much use for it after the game ends
</p>
