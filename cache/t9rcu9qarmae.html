Any Content downloaded from or otherwise accessed through the Services is accessed at your own risk; you alone will be responsible for any damage to your person or property, including your computer system and any other Device you use to access the Services, which results from accessing such content. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE DISCLAIMERS HEREIN DO NOT EXCLUDE ANY PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, STATUTORY CONSUMER RIGHTS, DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH PERSONAL INJURY OR RESULTING FROM COMPANY INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT, RECKLESSNESS, FRAUD, OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE.<br />
<br />
If you are dissatisfied with the Services or Content, your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using the Services.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>9. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY; RELEASE</em></strong><br />
<br />
Under no circumstances, including, but not limited to, negligence, will we be liable for any damages arising out of your use of the Services or of any information or Content made available on or through the Services, including indirect, incidental, special, punitive, exemplary or consequential damages, even if we are advised beforehand of the possibility of such damages. Because some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain categories of damages, the above limitation may not apply to you. In such states, our liability is limited to the fullest extent permitted by state law.<br />
<br />
You hereby release First Look and its affiliates (and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors, successors and assigns) from any and all claims, demands, losses, damages, rights, and actions of any kind, including personal injury, death, and property damage, that is related to or arises from your misuse of the Services, including, but not limited to, any interactions with or conduct of other users or third-party websites or services. If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states that “[a] general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”<br />
<br />
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY HEREIN DO NOT EXCLUDE ANY PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, STATUTORY CONSUMER RIGHTS, DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH PERSONAL INJURY OR RESULTING FROM COMPANY INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT, RECKLESSNESS, FRAUD, OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>10. INDEMNIFICATION</em></strong><br />
<br />
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless First Look, our affiliates, and each of our and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors, successors and assigns from and against any and all losses, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that arise out of your misuse of the Services, violation of these Terms by you, or your violation of any rights of another. We reserve the right to control the defense of any claim for which we are entitled to indemnification under this section. In such event, you agree to provide us with such cooperation as is reasonably requested by us. We will make reasonable efforts to provide you with notice of any such claim, but our failure to provide such notice will not relieve you of the indemnification obligations. This provision does not require you to indemnify First Look for any unconscionable commercial practice or for First Look’s fraud, deception, false promise, misrepresentation or concealment, suppression or omission of any material fact in connection with the Services.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>11. AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES AND CHOICE OF LAW</em></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS.  It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</strong><br />
<strong><em>WE BOTH AGREE TO ARBITRATE:</em></strong>  You and First Look agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms through final and binding arbitration, except that, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate First Look’s intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights).  Under such circumstances First Look may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above. </p>
<p><strong><em>WHAT IS ARBITRATION:</em></strong> Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced.<br />
</p>
<p><strong><em>ARBITRATION PROCEDURES:</em></strong> The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision. Arbitration shall be initiated through JAMS. Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures in front of one arbitrator.  If there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in this Terms will govern. The JAMS Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available from JAMS at <a target="_blank" href="www.jamsadr.com">http://www.jamsadr.com</a> or 1-800-352-5267.  To initiate arbitration, you or First Look must do the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1)    Write a demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com. </li>
<li>(2)    Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to: JAMS to your local JAMS office or to JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco, CA 94111</li>
<li>(3)    Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules. If travelling to New York is a burden, you may participate in the arbitration by phone or via document submission to the fullest extent allowable by the arbitrator. Each party will bear their own costs of arbitration unless the arbitrator directs that bearing such costs would be an undue burden and in that case, we will pay for your portion of the arbitration administrative costs (but not your attorneys’ fees). Arbitration under this agreement shall be held in the United States in New York, NY under New York law without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The arbitration may award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive relief). Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>AUTHORITY OF ARBITRATOR:</em></strong> The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and First Look, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and First Look.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>NO CLASS ACTIONS:</em></strong> You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL:</em></strong> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and First Look in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND FIRST LOOK WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>OPT-OUT OF AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE:</em></strong> You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing First Look <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#12616762627d606652747b6061667e7d7d793c717d7f2d616770787771662f5360707b666073667b7d7c3720225d62663720225d6766">here</a> with the Subject Line “Arbitration Opt Out” and providing the requested information as follows: (1) Your Name; (2) the URL of the Terms; (3) Your Address; (4) Your Phone Number; (5) and clear statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision in the Terms.  The Opt-Out Notice must be emailed no later than 30 days after the date you first accept the Terms by using the website.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>12. WAIVER OF INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF.</em></strong><br />
<br />
YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN AN INJUNCTION OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF OF ANY KIND, SUCH AS ANY COURT OR OTHER ACTION THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH OR PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEBSITE, APPLICATION, CONTENT, SUBMISSIONS, PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNED, LICENSED, USED OR CONTROLLED BY FIRST LOOK OR A LICENSOR OF FIRST LOOK.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>13. MISCELLANEOUS</em></strong><br />
<br />
This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between us and you with respect to this subject matter and supersedes all previous and contemporaneous agreements and communications on this subject, whether written or oral. This agreement is personal to you, is not intended to benefit any third party, and does not create any third party beneficiaries. If any provision of these Terms, or any Additional Terms, is for any reason deemed invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms or the Additional Terms, and the invalidity of the provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of these Terms or the applicable Additional Terms. You hereby waive any applicable statutory and common law that may permit a contract to be construed against its drafter.  The summaries of provisions and section headings are provided for convenience only and shall not limit the full Terms. First Look may assign its rights and obligations under these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, in whole or in part, to any party at any time without any notice.  You may not assign these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms to anyone and you may not delegate your duties under them, without the prior written consent of an officer of First Look. No First Look consent or approval may be deemed to have been granted by First Look without being in writing and signed by an officer of First Look. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms, (i) no failure or delay by you or First Look in exercising any of rights, powers, or remedies under will operate as a waiver of that or any other right, power, or remedy, and (ii) no waiver or modification of any term of these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against whom the waiver or modification is sought to be enforced.<br />
<br />
This agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action that you may have arising out of or related to use of the Services or these Terms must be filed by you within one year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.<br />
<br />
First Look controls and operates the Services from the U.S.A., and First Look makes no representation that the Services are appropriate or available for use beyond the U.S.A.  You agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to these Terms.  Software related to or made available by the Services may be subject to export controls of the U.S.A, and, except as authorized by law, you agree and warrant not to export or re-export the software to any county, or to any person, entity, or end-user subject to U.S. export controls or sanctions.<br />
<br />
The sections on Indemnification, Limitation of Liability; Release, and Disclaimers do not apply to New Jersey residents.<br />

AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES AND CHOICE OF LAW\u003c/em>\u003c/strong>\u003cbr />\n\u003cbr />\n\u003cstrong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS.  It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.\u003c/strong>\u003cbr />\n\u003cstrong>\u003cem>WE BOTH AGREE TO ARBITRATE:\u003c/em>\u003c/strong>  You and First Look agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms through final and binding arbitration, except that, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate First Look’s intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights).  Under such circumstances First Look may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above. \u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>\u003cem>WHAT IS ARBITRATION:\u003c/em>\u003c/strong> Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced.\u003cbr />\n\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>\u003cem>ARBITRATION PROCEDURES:\u003c/em>\u003c/strong> The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision. Arbitration shall be initiated through JAMS. Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures in front of one arbitrator.  If there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in this Terms will govern. The JAMS Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available from JAMS at \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"www.jamsadr.com\">http://www.jamsadr.com\u003c/a> or 1-800-352-5267.  To initiate arbitration, you or First Look must do the following things:\u003c/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>(1)    Write a demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com. \u003c/li>\n\u003cli>(2)    Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to: JAMS to your local JAMS office or to JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco, CA 94111\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>(3)    Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party.\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ul>\n\u003cp>\nPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules. If travelling to New York is a burden, you may participate in the arbitration by phone or via document submission to the fullest extent allowable by the arbitrator. Each party will bear their own costs of arbitration unless the arbitrator directs that bearing such costs would be an undue burden and in that case, we will pay for your portion of the arbitration administrative costs (but not your attorneys’ fees). Arbitration under this agreement shall be held in the United States in New York, NY under New York law without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The arbitration may award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive relief). Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\u003cbr />\n\u003cbr />\n\u003cstrong>\u003cem>AUTHORITY OF ARBITRATOR:\u003c/em>\u003c/strong> The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and First Look, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and First Look.\u003cbr />\n\u003cbr />\n\u003cstrong>\u003cem>NO CLASS ACTIONS:\u003c/em>\u003c/strong> You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.\u003cbr />\n\u003cbr />\n\u003cstrong>\u003cem>WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL:\u003c/em>\u003c/strong> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and First Look in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND FIRST LOOK WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.\u003cbr />\n\u003cbr />\n\u003cstrong>\u003cem>OPT-OUT OF AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE:\u003c/em>\u003c/strong> You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing First Look \u003ca href=\"mailto:support@firstlook.com?subject=Arbitration%20Opt%20Out\">here\u003c/a> with the Subject Line “Arbitration Opt Out” and providing the requested information as follows: (1) Your Name; (2) the URL of the Terms; (3) Your Address; (4) Your Phone Number; (5) and clear statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision in the Terms.  The Opt-Out Notice must be emailed no later than 30 days after the date you first accept the Terms by using the website.\u003cbr />\n\u003cbr />\n\u003cstrong>\u003cem>12. WAIVER OF INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF.\u003c/em>\u003c/strong>\u003cbr />\n\u003cbr />\nYOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN AN INJUNCTION OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF OF ANY KIND, SUCH AS ANY COURT OR OTHER ACTION THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH OR PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEBSITE, APPLICATION, CONTENT, SUBMISSIONS, PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNED, LICENSED, USED OR CONTROLLED BY FIRST LOOK OR A LICENSOR OF FIRST LOOK.\u003cbr />\n\u003cbr />\n\u003cstrong>\u003cem>13.

This agreement is personal to you, is not intended to benefit any third party, and does not create any third party beneficiaries. If any provision of these Terms, or any Additional Terms, is for any reason deemed invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms or the Additional Terms, and the invalidity of the provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of these Terms or the applicable Additional Terms. You hereby waive any applicable statutory and common law that may permit a contract to be construed against its drafter.  The summaries of provisions and section headings are provided for convenience only and shall not limit the full Terms. First Look may assign its rights and obligations under these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, in whole or in part, to any party at any time without any notice.  You may not assign these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms to anyone and you may not delegate your duties under them, without the prior written consent of an officer of First Look. No First Look consent or approval may be deemed to have been granted by First Look without being in writing and signed by an officer of First Look. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms, (i) no failure or delay by you or First Look in exercising any of rights, powers, or remedies under will operate as a waiver of that or any other right, power, or remedy, and (ii) no waiver or modification of any term of these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against whom the waiver or modification is sought to be enforced.\u003cbr />\n\u003cbr />\nThis agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action that you may have arising out of or related to use of the Services or these Terms must be filed by you within one year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.\u003cbr />\n\u003cbr />\nFirst Look controls and operates the Services from the U.S.A., and First Look makes no representation that the Services are appropriate or available for use beyond the U.S.A.

AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES AND CHOICE OF LAW\u003c/em>\u003c/strong>\u003cbr />\n\u003cbr />\n\u003cstrong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS.  It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.\u003c/strong>\u003cbr />\n\u003cstrong>\u003cem>WE BOTH AGREE TO ARBITRATE:\u003c/em>\u003c/strong>  You and First Look agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms through final and binding arbitration, except that, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate First Look’s intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights).  Under such circumstances First Look may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above. \u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>\u003cem>WHAT IS ARBITRATION:\u003c/em>\u003c/strong> Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced.\u003cbr />\n\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>\u003cem>ARBITRATION PROCEDURES:\u003c/em>\u003c/strong> The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision. Arbitration shall be initiated through JAMS. Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures in front of one arbitrator.  If there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in this Terms will govern. The JAMS Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available from JAMS at \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"www.jamsadr.com\">http://www.jamsadr.com\u003c/a> or 1-800-352-5267.  To initiate arbitration, you or First Look must do the following things:\u003c/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>(1)    Write a demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com. \u003c/li>\n\u003cli>(2)    Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to: JAMS to your local JAMS office or to JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco, CA 94111\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>(3)    Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party.\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ul>\n\u003cp>\nPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules. If travelling to New York is a burden, you may participate in the arbitration by phone or via document submission to the fullest extent allowable by the arbitrator. Each party will bear their own costs of arbitration unless the arbitrator directs that bearing such costs would be an undue burden and in that case, we will pay for your portion of the arbitration administrative costs (but not your attorneys’ fees). Arbitration under this agreement shall be held in the United States in New York, NY under New York law without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The arbitration may award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive relief). Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\u003cbr />\n\u003cbr />\n\u003cstrong>\u003cem>AUTHORITY OF ARBITRATOR:\u003c/em>\u003c/strong> The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and First Look, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and First Look.\u003cbr />\n\u003cbr />\n\u003cstrong>\u003cem>NO CLASS ACTIONS:\u003c/em>\u003c/strong> You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.\u003cbr />\n\u003cbr />\n\u003cstrong>\u003cem>WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL:\u003c/em>\u003c/strong> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and First Look in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND FIRST LOOK WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.\u003cbr />\n\u003cbr />\n\u003cstrong>\u003cem>OPT-OUT OF AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE:\u003c/em>\u003c/strong> You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing First Look \u003ca href=\"mailto:support@firstlook.com?subject=Arbitration%20Opt%20Out\">here\u003c/a> with the Subject Line “Arbitration Opt Out” and providing the requested information as follows: (1) Your Name; (2) the URL of the Terms; (3) Your Address; (4) Your Phone Number; (5) and clear statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision in the Terms.

No First Look consent or approval may be deemed to have been granted by First Look without being in writing and signed by an officer of First Look. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms, (i) no failure or delay by you or First Look in exercising any of rights, powers, or remedies under will operate as a waiver of that or any other right, power, or remedy, and (ii) no waiver or modification of any term of these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against whom the waiver or modification is sought to be enforced.\u003cbr />\n\u003cbr />\nThis agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law.
