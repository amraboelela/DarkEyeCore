	<h3>Other sites I like</h3>

	<p>It can be hard to find treasure in the junkyard known as the Internet, so I will catalogue the ones I've encountered here:</p>

	<p><a class = "articlelist" href = "https://www.debunkingskeptics.com/">Debunking Skeptics</a> - Probably my favorite site on the Internet (except my own, of course ^_^). I was reading it religiously as a teenager, and it provided strong support towards my questioning of mainstream theories and their devout defenders; without that site, there would <strong>likely be no Dig Deeper</strong>. If you liked my <a href="./ghost/mozilla.html">Mozilla</a> or <a href="./ghost/corona.html">Coronavirus</a> reports, you will feel right at home on <em>Debunking Skeptics</em>. Covers many fringe topics, such as <a href="https://www.debunkingskeptics.com/Conspiracies.htm">conspiracies</a>, <a href="https://www.debunkingskeptics.com/Presentation_Skepticism_Psi.htm">extrasensory perception</a>, and life after death. Mostly famous for its <a href="https://www.debunkingskeptics.com/Contents.htm">total destruction</a> of the so-called <em>rational skeptics</em>, pretty much making them look like total idiots. Sadly hasn't been updated in a long time, but all the reports in there are still very relevant today.</p>

	<p><a class = "articlelist" href = "https://www.macroevolution.net/introduction.html">Eugene McCarthy</a> - Are humans the hybrids of chimpanzees and pigs? Finally, we have a scientific explanation for humanity's existence that fits the pieces extremely well together without all the pitfalls of mainstream theories. Take the pigpill!</p>

	<p><a class = "articlelist" href = "http://ciphersbyritter.com">Ciphers by Ritter</a> - Best cryptography resource out there, by a mile. Explains the basics thoroughly and in a way that's easy to understand. Debunks myths and covers stuff that other sites don't dare to touch. Clearly, the author has a deep understanding of the topic.</p>

	<p><a class = "articlelist" href = "https://raypeat.com">Raymond Peat's site</a> - Writings of biologist Ray Peat, mostly covering human physiology and nutrition, but drifting into other related topics (including relevant conspiracies) sometimes. Extremely well thought-out and researched; compared to regular nutrition sites, it's in another stratosphere.</p>

	<p><a class = "articlelist" href = "http://mileswmathis.com">Miles Mathis</a> - One of the best sources out there for exposing staged events such as shootings, elections, and of course the <a href="./ghost/corona.html">fake pandemic</a>. Though he tends to go on rants and sometimes spends too much time on things that don't really matter (IMO) such as numerology or some other weird patterns. Still, clearly a smart and unique guy that digs deep, even in places other people don't dare to go (check out his <a href="http://milesmathis.com/hawk3.pdf">Stephen Hawking report</a>, for example - and prepare to have your mind blown to pieces). Also includes some physics stuff that allegedly refutes modern science, but I can't confirm it as I don't really understand it.</p>

	<p><a class = "articlelist" href = "https://www.dragonflycave.com">The Cave of Dragonflies</a> - Look at the beautiful, old-school design! And the lovely style switcher! Imagine the effort, which has to be appreciated in the age of soydevism. Also, maintaining a Pokemon site for 20 (!) years is really impressive. Though it also has other useful content like HTML tutorials. And yet, the site hasn't managed to rack up even 10 million views during its entire existence. Sad.</p>

	<h4>Tech blogs</h4>

	<p>These might have some political or other content, as well, but are primarily or at least significantly tech-related.</p>

	<p><a class = "articlelist" href="http://qyeifp2auiz6ae434w76nzj7vjxd3qib7rqw4uusaj6k42f3p5abxxyd.onion/">Werwolf</a> || <a class = "articlelist" href="https://unixsheikh.com/">Unix Sheikh</a> || <a class = "articlelist" href="https://sadgrl.online/">sadgrl</a> || <a class = "articlelist" href="https://ar.al">Aral Balkan</a> || <a class = "articlelist" href="https://sysdfree.wordpress.com">sysdfree</a> || <a class = "articlelist" href="http://gpvdip7rd7bdy5gf7scl3rzgzgzckqw4sqxbmy6g3zijfwu4lz3ypbyd.onion/">Udonya</a> || <a class = "articlelist" href="https://ryocafe.site/">Ryo</a> || <a href="https://wrongthink.neocities.org/">Wrongthink</a></p>

	<img class = "inside" src = "./images/button.png" alt = "Button for linking to my site. The hooded guy's face cannot be seen, as it is too dark. And he lacks scary ghostly flashy eyes because the faggot designer refused to draw them." />
