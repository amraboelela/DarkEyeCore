RE: Yuma Border Patrol Sector’s Practice of Confiscating Sikh Individuals’ Turbans
During Asylum Processing
Dear Commissioner Magnus, 
We write to inform you of ongoing, serious religious-freedom violationsin the Yuma Border Patrol 
Sector, where your agents are confiscating turbans from Sikh individuals during asylum 
processing. In the last two months alone, our organizational partners in Arizona have documented 
nearly 50 cases of asylees arriving from Yuma who reported that their religious headwear had been 
taken by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and never returned or replaced.
1 These
practices blatantly violate federal law. They are also inconsistent with CBP’s own national 
standards and contrary to the agency’s non-discrimination policy, which states that “CBP 
employees must treat all individuals with dignity and respect…with full respect for individual 
rights including…freedom of….religion.”2 We ask that you promptly investigate these civil-rights 
violations and direct agents in the Yuma Border Patrol Sector to immediately cease these unlawful
practices. Furthermore, we respectfully request a meeting in the meantime to discuss your plan to 
remedy the situation. 
1 Between January 2022 and July 2022 there were a total of 65 reports that CBP removed religious headwear. Forty￾seven of these incidents occurred in June and July 2022. These reports included one Muslim woman whose hijab was 
seized and never returned during Border Patrol processing. However, because the other recent instances of religious 
headwear removal involve Sikh individuals, this letter focuses on the confiscation of turbans. Nevertheless, our 
concern extends to Yuma Border Patrol Sector’s practices with respect to all religious headwear.

I. Factual Background
a. Sikhism and the Religious Importance of the Turban
The Sikh faith is the world’s fifth largest organized religion. There are approximately 30 million 
Sikhs worldwide, and over 500,000 Sikhs reside in the United States. Many Sikhs wear an external 
uniform to unify and bind them to the beliefs of the religion and to always remind them of their 
commitment to Sikh teachings. These articles of faith have deep spiritual significance, as they 
signify an individual’s commitment to Sikhism and its highest ideals of love and service to 
humanity. Unlike some other faiths, where only the clergy are in uniform, most initiated Sikhs 
believe they are required to wear external articles of faith. The Sikh Code of Conduct, called the 
Rehat Maryada, explicitly instructs that observant Sikhs wear a turban over their unshorn, uncut 
hair.3
Many Sikhs consider their turban to be a precious gift from their Guru, and many wash their hands 
before tying it. Unlike a hat, a turban must always cover a Sikh’s head. The turban reminds a Sikh 
of their duty to maintain and uphold the core beliefs of the Sikh faith. When a Sikh ties a turban, 
the turban ceases to be just a piece of cloth and becomes one and the same with the Sikh’s head. It 
is a religious commitment without which many Sikhs may feel that they have ceased to be a Sikh.
Historically, uncut hair and turbans have been the most central feature of the Sikh identity. For 
example, in the 18th century, Sikhs in South Asia were persecuted and forced to convert from their 
religion. The method of forcing conversions was to remove a Sikh’s turban and cut off their hair. 
Since then, forcibly removing or targeting a Sikh’s turban or facial hair has symbolized denying 
that person the right to belong to the Sikh faith and is perceived by many as the most humiliating 
and hurtful physical and spiritual injury that can be inflicted upon a Sikh. 
b. Confiscation of Turbans by Yuma Border Patrol Sector
The International Rescue Committee (IRC) of Arizona operates a reception site in Phoenix (“the 
Welcome Center”) that receives a large proportion of asylees who are released from Department 
of Homeland Security (DHS) custody within Arizona. In the last two months, IRC has documented 
almost 50 cases of asylees arriving from Yuma who reported that their religious headwear—
specifically, turbans—had been confiscated by CBP. While the Welcome Center has encountered 
cases of religious headwear being confiscated every month of this year, in June 2022, the number 
of reports rose sharply, prompting concern that border officials have ramped up their efforts to 
seize these sacred items. 
In response to these increasing reports of confiscated turbans, volunteers at the Welcome Center
have tried to source turbans from the local Sikh community to provide replacements. A generous 
advocate has supplied the Welcome Center with more than fifty turbans by soliciting them from
3 See Ch. 10, Art.16(t), translated by W. H. McLeod: Textual Sources For the Study of Sikhism, Manchester University 
Press, 1984. </p></div><div class="DocumentViewerPage DocumentViewerPage--display-image" data-reactid="134"><div class="DocumentViewerPage-sizer" style="padding-bottom:129.41176470588235%;" data-reactid="135"></div><p class="DocumentViewerPage-text" id="DocumentViewerPage-text--3" data-reactid="136">3
family, friends, and congregations. Unfortunately, this is not a long-term solution because of the 
sheer number of turbans needed.
Concerns about Border Patrol’s confiscation of religious headwear are not new. In March of 2019, 
the American Civil Liberties Union sent a letter to the DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil 
Liberties, the Office of the Inspector General, and CBP, among others, reporting that “many Sikh 
immigrants have had their turbans and sacred religious bracelets . . . confiscated at the border.”4
The letter explained that these items are not returned “[d]espite repeated requests,” and asked that 
officials investigate these and other religious-freedom violations. In a September 2020 follow-up 
letter to the same offices, the ACLU again noted that “religious attire, such as head coverings, and 
other religious articles . . . were confiscated and never returned.”5
More recently, since May, advocates working with Yuma asylees have repeatedly raised this issue 
during government stakeholder meetings. IRC initially expressed its concern about the practice of 
confiscating turbans at one of its weekly Maricopa County Asylum Stakeholders Calls. These 
meetings are regularly attended by representatives of CBP, EOC Region IX SBCC, and 
occasionally, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Since broaching the issue in 
May, IRC has continued to highlight it as an ongoing problem at every subsequent meeting. IRC
also notified the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO) of its concerns during 
an in-person meeting on June 14, 2022. 
Beginning in early June, advocates also have discussed the religious headwear issue with DHS 
officials at recurring stakeholder meetings with EOC Region IX SBCC. At the most recent meeting
on July 8, 2022 (with the ACLU of Arizona in attendance), CBP representatives claimed that the 
agency confiscates turbans only when they pose a security risk and that agents decline to store the 
turbans only when they are wet or damaged. The reports received by IRC, however, indicate 
otherwise. During these meetings, officials seemed unaware of their obligations under CBP policy 
and federal law to protect asylees’ religious-freedom rights and, when informed that the seizure of 
turbans had markedly increased in recent months, they had no viable explanation for it. 
Despite numerous contacts about this issue, to our knowledge, no meaningful investigation has 
occurred.
6 Only this week did Chief John Modlin (CBP Tucson), who has attended the Maricopa 
Asylum Stakeholders calls, finally reach out to IRC to state that he had raised the concern with the 
CBP Yuma Sector, who informed him that processing officials were being retrained. But IRC has 
yet to see any evidence of this. Indeed, as recently as this week, IRC has received additional reports 
of turban seizures by Yuma Border Patrol.

6 Because Yuma CBP has been almost entirely absent from stakeholders’ calls pertaining to asylees in the Arizona 
region, we and other advocates have been unable to ask them directly about their policies and procedures regarding 
religious headwear. </p></div><div class="DocumentViewerPage DocumentViewerPage--display-image" data-reactid="137"><div class="DocumentViewerPage-sizer" style="padding-bottom:129.41176470588235%;" data-reactid="138"></div><p class="DocumentViewerPage-text" id="DocumentViewerPage-text--4" data-reactid="139">4
II. Yuma Border Patrol Sector must immediately cease its unlawful practice of confiscating
Sikh asylees’ turbans.
CBP’s own policy requires that officers “remain cognizant of an individual’s religious beliefs 
while accomplishing an enforcement action in a dignified and respectful manner.”7 And for good 
reason: Many individuals seeking asylum, particularly those who are Sikh, have fled their home 
countries due to religious persecution and should feel safe in practicing their faith in the United 
States. The Yuma Border Patrol’s confiscation of Sikh individuals’ turbans not only ignores CBP
policy, but it also violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which prohibits the 
government from substantially burdening an individual’s religious exercise unless the burden “(1) 
is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of 
furthering that compelling governmental interest.”8
Federal courts have repeatedly held that denying a person of faith the right to wear religious 
headgear imposes a substantial burden on their religious exercise.9 By confiscating and failing to 
return Sikh individuals’ turbans, CBP directly interferes with their religious practice and forces 
them to violate their religious beliefs. As discussed above, for many Sikhs, the turban is a central 
aspect of their religious identity; exposing their “naked” heads to others is considered sacrilegious 
and shameful.10 Those seeking asylum who have their religious headwear seized by border 
officials must proceed through processing and short-term detention without it.11 They are then 
released from Border Patrol’s custody without any means of obtaining a replacement.
This substantial burden is not the least restrictive means of furthering any compelling interest. 
Even assuming that officials have a compelling interest in inspecting turbans and religious 
headwear for contraband or for other safety reasons, confiscating the turbans and refusing to return 
them is an extreme and unnecessary approach. Rather than forcing Sikh individuals to remove 
their turbans, officers could gently pat down the turbans or use a security wand to check them. If 
7 See T.E.D.S., Policy 1.5 (Religious Sensitivity) at 4. 
8 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1. RFRA applies to any “branch, department, agency, instrumentality, and official (or other 
person acting under color of law) of the United States.” Id. § 2000bb-2(1). This includes border patrol. See, e.g., 
United States v. Ramon, 86 F. Supp. 2d 665, 677 (W.D. Tex. 2000) (holding that border patrol’s policy of targeting 
and stopping vehicles displaying religious symbols violated RFRA).
9 See, e.g., Singh v. McHugh, 185 F. Supp. 3d 201, 216-17 (D.D.C. 2016) (holding that Army’s denial of religious 
accommodation constituted a substantial burden where Sikh plaintiff sincerely believed that not wearing his turban 
would dishonor and offend God); cf. Singh v. Goord, 520 F. Supp. 2d 487, 503 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (prohibiting Sikh 
prisoner from wearing his turban during outside transports substantially burdened his religious exercise because his

there is a reason for a particular turban to be removed, the individual could be permitted to remove 
it himself for inspection and then allowed to immediately retie it once any concerns are resolved.
After an initial inspection, there is simply no excuse for refusing Sikhs the right to wear their 
turbans. Institutions with comparable (or even greater) security concerns explicitly authorize 
religious headwear, including turbans. The Federal Bureau of Prisons, for example, has long 
permitted yarmulkes, kufis, Native American headbands, Rastafarian crowns, and Sikh turbans, to 
be worn “throughout the institution.”12 And ICE’s detention standards authorize the same, 
mandating that, where a facility adopts restrictions on the color, size, or other feature of such 
religious dress, it “must ensure that detainees are provided conforming religious headwear for free 
or at a de minimu[s] cost.”13 Moreover, ICE policy requires officials to “consult a religious 
authority before confiscation of a religious item that constitutes ‘soft’ contraband.”14 The standards 
direct that “[r]religious headwear and other religious property shall be handled with respect at all 
times, including during the intake process.”15
As the Supreme Court has explained, “the policies followed at other well-run institutions would 
be relevant to a determination of the need for a particular type of restriction.”16 Because Yuma 
Border Patrol Sector cannot possibly justify its practice of confiscating and effectively prohibiting 
turbans while other institutions “with the same compelling interests . . . [have been] able to 
accommodate the same religious practices,” officials’ conduct fails strict scrutiny under RFRA.17
III. Conclusion
Robust protections for religious exercise are crucial in settings where individuals are in 
government custody. Yuma Border Patrol Sector’s actions against Sikh asylees are especially 
egregious because the ability to wear a turban is a core tenet of the Sikh faith and religious practice. 
Yuma officials must cease their practice of confiscating turbans or any other religious headwear. 
We request that you take immediate and concrete steps to end all such confiscations in Yuma and 
all other sectors. Lastly, we note that the permanent confiscation of religious headwear is but one

In the last two months alone, our organizational partners in Arizona have documented \nnearly 50 cases of asylees arriving from Yuma who reported that their religious headwear had been \ntaken by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and never returned or replaced.\n1 These\npractices blatantly violate federal law. They are also inconsistent with CBP’s own national \nstandards and contrary to the agency’s non-discrimination policy, which states that “CBP \nemployees must treat all individuals with dignity and respect…with full respect for individual \nrights including…freedom of….religion.”2 We ask that you promptly investigate these civil-rights \nviolations and direct agents in the Yuma Border Patrol Sector to immediately cease these unlawful\npractices. Furthermore, we respectfully request a meeting in the meantime to discuss your plan to \nremedy the situation. \n1 Between January 2022 and July 2022 there were a total of 65 reports that CBP removed religious headwear. Forty￾seven of these incidents occurred in June and July 2022. These reports included one Muslim woman whose hijab was \nseized and never returned during Border Patrol processing. However, because the other recent instances of religious \nheadwear removal involve Sikh individuals, this letter focuses on the confiscation of turbans. Nevertheless, our \nconcern extends to Yuma Border Patrol Sector’s practices with respect to all religious headwear. \n2 See U.S. Customs and Border Protection, National Standards on Transport, Escort, Detention and Search (T.E.D.S)\n(Oct. 2015) Policy, 1.4 (Non-Discrimination) 1, 4, https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2020-\nFeb/cbp-teds-policy-october2015.pdf.\u0000","lang":"eng","ocr":null,"page":0,"updated":1659453610999},{"contents":"2\nI. Factual Background\na. Sikhism and the Religious Importance of the Turban\nThe Sikh faith is the world’s fifth largest organized religion. There are approximately 30 million \nSikhs worldwide, and over 500,000 Sikhs reside in the United States. Many Sikhs wear an external \nuniform to unify and bind them to the beliefs of the religion and to always remind them of their \ncommitment to Sikh teachings. These articles of faith have deep spiritual significance, as they \nsignify an individual’s commitment to Sikhism and its highest ideals of love and service to \nhumanity. Unlike some other faiths, where only the clergy are in uniform, most initiated Sikhs \nbelieve they are required to wear external articles of faith. The Sikh Code of Conduct, called the \nRehat Maryada, explicitly instructs that observant Sikhs wear a turban over their unshorn, uncut \nhair.3\nMany Sikhs consider their turban to be a precious gift from their Guru, and many wash their hands \nbefore tying it. Unlike a hat, a turban must always cover a Sikh’s head. The turban reminds a Sikh \nof their duty to maintain and uphold the core beliefs of the Sikh faith. When a Sikh ties a turban, \nthe turban ceases to be just a piece of cloth and becomes one and the same with the Sikh’s head. It \nis a religious commitment without which many Sikhs may feel that they have ceased to be a Sikh.\nHistorically, uncut hair and turbans have been the most central feature of the Sikh identity. For \nexample, in the 18th century, Sikhs in South Asia were persecuted and forced to convert from their \nreligion. The method of forcing conversions was to remove a Sikh’s turban and cut off their hair. \nSince then, forcibly removing or targeting a Sikh’s turban or facial hair has symbolized denying \nthat person the right to belong to the Sikh faith and is perceived by many as the most humiliating \nand hurtful physical and spiritual injury that can be inflicted upon a Sikh. \nb. Confiscation of Turbans by Yuma Border Patrol Sector\nThe International Rescue Committee (IRC) of Arizona operates a reception site in Phoenix (“the \nWelcome Center”) that receives a large proportion of asylees who are released from Department \nof Homeland Security (DHS) custody within Arizona. In the last two months, IRC has documented \nalmost 50 cases of asylees arriving from Yuma who reported that their religious headwear—\nspecifically, turbans—had been confiscated by CBP. While the Welcome Center has encountered \ncases of religious headwear being confiscated every month of this year, in June 2022, the number \nof reports rose sharply, prompting concern that border officials have ramped up their efforts to \nseize these sacred items. \nIn response to these increasing reports of confiscated turbans, volunteers at the Welcome Center\nhave tried to source turbans from the local Sikh community to provide replacements. A generous \nadvocate has supplied the Welcome Center with more than fifty turbans by soliciting them from\n3 See Ch. 10, Art.16(t), translated by W. H. McLeod: Textual Sources For the Study of Sikhism, Manchester University \nPress, 1984.\u0000","lang":"eng","ocr":null,"page":1,"updated":1659453610999},{"contents":"3\nfamily, friends, and congregations. Unfortunately, this is not a long-term solution because of the \nsheer number of turbans needed.\nConcerns about Border Patrol’s confiscation of religious headwear are not new. In March of 2019, \nthe American Civil Liberties Union sent a letter to the DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil \nLiberties, the Office of the Inspector General, and CBP, among others, reporting that “many Sikh \nimmigrants have had their turbans and sacred religious bracelets . . . confiscated at the border.”4\nThe letter explained that these items are not returned “[d]espite repeated requests,” and asked that \nofficials investigate these and other religious-freedom violations. In a September 2020 follow-up \nletter to the same offices, the ACLU again noted that “religious attire, such as head coverings, and \nother religious articles . . . were confiscated and never returned.”5\nMore recently, since May, advocates working with Yuma asylees have repeatedly raised this issue \nduring government stakeholder meetings. IRC initially expressed its concern about the practice of \nconfiscating turbans at one of its weekly Maricopa County Asylum Stakeholders Calls. These \nmeetings are regularly attended by representatives of CBP, EOC Region IX SBCC, and \noccasionally, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Since broaching the issue in \nMay, IRC has continued to highlight it as an ongoing problem at every subsequent meeting. IRC\nalso notified the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO) of its concerns during \nan in-person meeting on June 14, 2022. \nBeginning in early June, advocates also have discussed the religious headwear issue with DHS \nofficials at recurring stakeholder meetings with EOC Region IX SBCC. At the most recent meeting\non July 8, 2022 (with the ACLU of Arizona in attendance), CBP representatives claimed that the \nagency confiscates turbans only when they pose a security risk and that agents decline to store the \nturbans only when they are wet or damaged. The reports received by IRC, however, indicate \notherwise. During these meetings, officials seemed unaware of their obligations under CBP policy \nand federal law to protect asylees’ religious-freedom rights and, when informed that the seizure of \nturbans had markedly increased in recent months, they had no viable explanation for it. \nDespite numerous contacts about this issue, to our knowledge, no meaningful investigation has \noccurred.\n6 Only this week did Chief John Modlin (CBP Tucson), who has attended the Maricopa \nAsylum Stakeholders calls, finally reach out to IRC to state that he had raised the concern with the \nCBP Yuma Sector, who informed him that processing officials were being retrained. But IRC has \nyet to see any evidence of this. Indeed, as recently as this week, IRC has received additional reports \nof turban seizures by Yuma Border Patrol.\n4 ACLU Letter, Investigating religious-freedom violations by Border Patrol and ICE (Mar. 19, 2019) \nhttps://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/3-15-19_aclu_request_for_investigation_of_religious￾freedom_violations_.pdf.\n5 ACLU Letter, Investigating religious-freedom violations by DHS (Sept. 10, 2020), \nhttps://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/follow-up_letter_to_dhs_oig_crcl_9-10-20.pdf.\n6 Because Yuma CBP has been almost entirely absent from stakeholders’ calls pertaining to asylees in the Arizona \nregion, we and other advocates have been unable to ask them directly about their policies and procedures regarding \nreligious headwear.\u0000","lang":"eng","ocr":null,"page":2,"updated":1659453610999},{"contents":"4\nII. Yuma Border Patrol Sector must immediately cease its unlawful practice of confiscating\nSikh asylees’ turbans.\nCBP’s own policy requires that officers “remain cognizant of an individual’s religious beliefs \nwhile accomplishing an enforcement action in a dignified and respectful manner.”7 And for good \nreason: Many individuals seeking asylum, particularly those who are Sikh, have fled their home \ncountries due to religious persecution and should feel safe in practicing their faith in the United \nStates. The Yuma Border Patrol’s confiscation of Sikh individuals’ turbans not only ignores CBP\npolicy, but it also violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which prohibits the \ngovernment from substantially burdening an individual’s religious exercise unless the burden “(1) \nis in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of \nfurthering that compelling governmental interest.”8\nFederal courts have repeatedly held that denying a person of faith the right to wear religious \nheadgear imposes a substantial burden on their religious exercise.9 By confiscating and failing to \nreturn Sikh individuals’ turbans, CBP directly interferes with their religious practice and forces \nthem to violate their religious beliefs. As discussed above, for many Sikhs, the turban is a central \naspect of their religious identity; exposing their “naked” heads to others is considered sacrilegious \nand shameful.10 Those seeking asylum who have their religious headwear seized by border \nofficials must proceed through processing and short-term detention without it.11 They are then \nreleased from Border Patrol’s custody without any means of obtaining a replacement.\nThis substantial burden is not the least restrictive means of furthering any compelling interest. \nEven assuming that officials have a compelling interest in inspecting turbans and religious \nheadwear for contraband or for other safety reasons, confiscating the turbans and refusing to return \nthem is an extreme and unnecessary approach. Rather than forcing Sikh individuals to remove \ntheir turbans, officers could gently pat down the turbans or use a security wand to check them. If \n7 See T.E.D.S., Policy 1.5 (Religious Sensitivity) at 4. \n8 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1. RFRA applies to any “branch, department, agency, instrumentality, and official (or other \nperson acting under color of law) of the United States.” Id. § 2000bb-2(1). This includes border patrol. See, e.g., \nUnited States v. Ramon, 86 F. Supp. 2d 665, 677 (W.D. Tex. 2000) (holding that border patrol’s policy of targeting \nand stopping vehicles displaying religious symbols violated RFRA).\n9 See, e.g., Singh v. McHugh, 185 F.
