<p><u>It is one</u> of the rituals of school shootings in America — another round of debate, usually among journalists, on whether graphic photos should be published. If people could just see what assault weapons do to young bodies, the argument goes, they would no longer tolerate the policies that enable these killings. No, the other side warns, these photos would only cause further pain to the survivors and have no impact on a divided society that moves from one gruesome entertainment to another with the flick of a switch.</p>
<p>This debate skips along the surface of an American aberration: We passively tolerate high levels of violence while actively suppressing evidence of the slaughter. It is not just school shootings that we forbid ourselves from seeing — and I mean really seeing, not the thoughts-and-prayers equivalent of gazing in sadness at memorial wreaths. It is also the visual evidence of more than 1 million people who died from Covid-19 in the U.S that we don’t see. It is the visual evidence of not just American soldiers killed in our forever wars, but the far greater number of civilians who have perished (at least several hundred thousand in Iraq). And it is the other forms of avoidable death in our homeland that we don&#8217;t really see, including traffic violence and drug overdoses.</p>

<p>The scale of American violence is awe-inspiring in all the wrong ways. The rate of shootings — school shootings, mass shootings, police shootings, accidental shootings, suicidal shootings — is top of the charts compared with almost every other country on our planet. The same goes for the other ways Americans kill and die; we excel at the fatal work of extinguishing each other. No single factor can be blamed, but it’s notable that energetic measures are consistently taken to prevent us from seeing what is done. These measures have only intensified as our society has become more visual, with screens tuned to every aspect of the human experience except its final act. As the photographer Nina Berman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/30/us/politics/photos-uvalde.html">explained</a> to a New York Times reporter a few days ago, “For a culture so steeped in violence, we spend a lot of time preventing anyone from actually seeing that violence. Something else is going on here, and I’m not sure it’s just that we’re trying to be sensitive.”</p>

<p>There’s a curious thing about this visual void: It requires an aggressive act of construction to come into existence. Let’s look first at school shootings.</p>
<p>There are several barriers that prevent us from seeing graphic photos of school shootings. The first is that the victims tend to be inside their schools, which are crime scenes that the police seal off from reporters. Even after the job of evidence collection is finished and the cleaners are called in, journalists are kept out. Law enforcement entities make their own photos and recordings of these sites, but those are closely held and sometimes <a href="https://www.rcfp.org/connecticut-passes-law-restricting-access-newtown-shooting-other-pol/">protected by law</a>. Even if graphic photos become available — and that’s rare to nonexistent — news outlets are reluctant to publish them, due to concerns about privacy, propriety, and criticism from readers.</p>

<p>One of the few graphic photos that has been circulated is from Columbine in 1999, when a photographer from the Rocky Mountain News flew in a helicopter over the school on the day of the shooting and took <a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/photo-staff-2">a photo</a> of a student’s body on the ground outside, not far from a police officer and several students sheltering behind a car. While the newspaper’s pictures earned a Pulitzer Prize, the reaction was mixed locally. “Hostility against the press got so bad that we had people throwing snowballs with rocks in them at our photographers,” <a href="https://blogs.berkeley.edu/2019/08/05/when-reporting-on-mass-shootings-is-no-longer-enough/">noted</a> John Temple, the paper’s editor at the time. Imagine what would happen today if an equivalent photo were published from Uvalde: The bad-faith brigade would find a hundred ways to distract us from an honest discussion about what it conveys.</p>

<p>But let’s remember that government and public hostility to graphic photos extends far beyond our schools, to battlefields thousands of miles away. Particularly since 9/11, the U.S. military has maintained <a href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/93267660">strict prohibitions</a> on journalists taking pictures of injured or dead soldiers in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other combat zones. In recent years, the military has found the most efficient solution of all: It all but forbids journalists from embedding in combat operations. Even photography of military caskets was out of bounds for a long while. The Pentagon has an ever-growing cache of footage of people being killed in U.S. bombing attacks, but it’s only in exceptional circumstances, like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/19/us/politics/afghanistan-drone-strike-video.html">the furor</a> over the drone killing of an extended family in Kabul, Afghanistan, in 2021, that we see any of it.</p>
<p>The economy of war zone photos is not controlled by the military alone. News organizations have proved reluctant to publish pictures of dead soldiers. In 2008, freelance photographer Zoriah Miller was expelled from his military embed in Iraq after posting on his blog a photo of a dead U.S. soldier. Even after that, no major publication was interested in his rare picture. The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/26/world/middleeast/26censor.html">did eventually publish it</a>, but for a story about military censorship. One of the most haunting photos from the Gulf War, showing the corpse of an Iraqi soldier burned alive, was not distributed by any major outlet. “If we’re big enough to fight a war, we should be big enough to look at it,” <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220305051906/https:/www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/08/the-war-photo-no-one-would-publish/375762/">said</a> Kenneth Jarecke, the photographer.</p>

<p>The essence of America — its raw capitalism — is at least partly to blame. What would the readers and advertisers think? More than a million people have died of Covid in the U.S., yet there have been precious few images of these people as they perished in hospitals. I spent a good deal of time last year investigating why we were seeing so many pictures of doctors and nurses but <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/11/13/covid-pandemic-hidden-toll-hospitals/">almost none</a> of the people whose lives were lost. One of the principal reasons was that hospitals were concerned about legal liability and the damage that images of death and chaos could do to their brands. “There was no benefit to them showing the apocalypse and what it looked like,” <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/11/13/covid-pandemic-hidden-toll-hospitals/">said</a> Dr. Craig Spencer, director of global health in emergency medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. “Having patients all over the emergency department on oxygen canisters and people intubated is not going to be a good image for your hospital.”</p>
<p>I think the familiar debate about whether to publish graphic photos of school shootings — or Covid victims or war casualties — has lost its urgency. Like so much else, it has become a ritual that we dutifully enact after another outrage occurs. I think the answer to the debate is clear — yes, publish the photos, it’s the right thing to do, we should be aware of what our plagues of violence beget. I also think it’s now more likely that if news outlets get possession of the right photo from Uvalde or from the next school shooting (we won’t have to wait long, this is America), they will publish it. But it will be from a position of desperation. They have tried everything else to change minds; this is all that’s left.</p>
<p>The truth is, it no longer matters so much. It’s not just, as the critic Susie Linfield <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/uvalde-shooting-photos.html">wrote</a> the other day, that photos rarely result in the kind of change that their supporters hope for. What’s different now is that on the life-or-death issues that confront us — shootings, wars, Covid, opioids, traffic violence — the awfulness of what has been allowed to accumulate over the decades is so damn vast. How can those responsible begin to backtrack? We&#8217;re not talking about a modest correction. America without its violence — without the factions that don’t mind the violence and even draw some benefit from it — would be a new country. There’s a path to getting there, but it’s going to require work and discomfort that’s far more complicated than publishing a shocking photo.</p>

<p><u>If your anger</u> at Fox News is directed toward Tucker Carlson, you’re focusing on the symptom rather than the cause of what’s wrong. It is the Murdoch family, which owns Fox News, that’s the biggest advocate in America for the &#8220;great replacement theory.&#8221;</p>
<p>It’s right to be furious about <a href="https://twitter.com/mehdirhasan/status/1526006611751448582">Carlson espousing</a> the racist conspiracy theory that inspired a white supremacist to kill 10 people in Buffalo last weekend, but Carlson serves at the pleasure of Rupert Murdoch and his heirs.

<p>The decisive role of the Murdochs was emphasized this week by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who implored them to cease platforming &#8220;great replacement&#8221; lies. “For years, these types of beliefs have existed at the fringes of American life,” Schumer <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/senator-chuck-schumer-s-letter-to-fox-news-executives/050ee10e2ba61147/full.pdf">wrote</a> in a letter to Rupert Murdoch, his eldest son Lachlan, and two Fox News executives. “However, this pernicious theory, which has no basis in fact, has been injected into the mainstream thanks in large part to a dangerous level of amplification by your network and its anchors.”</p>
<p>In other words, the Murdochs are <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/stormfront">Stormfront</a> with clout.</p>
<p>Due to public pressure, most major advertisers have pulled away from Carlson in recent years, and other programs on Fox News are heading in that direction. But it doesn’t really matter: The network derives most of its income from cable providers that pay generous fees to carry it. Comcast and other cable companies do not think twice about pouring <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93y5v8/millions-of-americans-are-unwittingly-funding-tucker-carlsons-show-george-floyd-derek-chauvin">nearly $2 billion</a> a year into a pseudo news operation that’s been described as a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-fox-news.html">hate-for-profit racket</a>.” So long as there’s not too much of a stink — which a campaign called <a href="https://unfoxmycablebox.com/">#UnFoxMyCableBox</a> is aiming to create — cable providers do not mind enriching a family whose marketing of intellectual poison remains an attractive business proposition.</p>

<p>The Murdochs have adopted an ancient strategy associated with money launderers and bootleggers who do not wish to live in the shadows: They surround their objectionable endeavors with reputable ones. Challenges to their propriety are diminished by the legitimate things they actually do and the upstanding associates they really have. The Murdochs, for instance, possess an array of valuable assets in the U.S. that include a network of TV stations that broadcast sports and entertainment programs. This gives the family a loyal army of bankers, producers, actors, sports stars, and journalists who are willing to see them as they wish to be seen and uninterested in asking about those other things they do with their money and time.</p>
<p>Just last week, Lachlan Murdoch, who runs the family’s sprawling empire on a day-to-day basis (Rupert is 91 years old), had a <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4509639-fox-corporations-foxa-ceo-lachlan-murdoch-on-q3-2022-results-earnings-call-transcript">friendly earnings call</a> with a group of Wall Street analysts. The softball financial questions from the representatives of Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America steered miles away from the political untidiness at Fox News. Nobody asked why Lachlan, when Carlson breaks another taboo, responds by <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/03/media/lachlan-murdoch-tucker-carlson-fox-news/index.html">texting</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/30/us/tucker-carlson-gop-republican-party.html">calling</a> his favorite host to let him know the family is behind him all the way.</p>
<p>On Monday, Lachlan was back in the establishment’s kind embrace, this time with advertising executives and media buyers who were attending the “upfront” presentations of his family’s U.S. broadcast units: Fox Entertainment, Fox Sports, and Fox News. Lachlan, according to <a href="https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/fox-upfront-prerecorded-in-person-event-1235268542/">Variety</a>, was dressed in sneakers and watched as his management team outlined their offerings for the coming year, including the next Super Bowl and World Cup, as well as entertainment programs featuring, among others, actors Jon Hamm and Susan Sarandon. The presentation about Fox News made <a href="https://twitter.com/blowryontv/status/1526301953482891264">no mention</a> of the network spreading the idea that white Americans are being replaced by nonwhite immigrants, and Carlson’s name was not uttered once.</p>
<p>The inevitable truth is that corporate America loves the Murdochs. Powerful executives who would leave a room if Alex Jones or Steve Bannon presented himself are delighted to have a moment with Rupert or Lachlan.</p>

<h2>Hollywood and the Murdochs</h2>
<p>Is there any way to disconnect corporate America from the family that operates the “<a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/network-propaganda-9780190923631?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;">central node</a>” of the far-right conspiracy machine?</p>
<p>Reader, I have mused about this <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2018/11/04/fox-news-is-poisoning-america-shun-rupert-murdoch/">a lot</a>. <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/03/30/lachlan-murdoch-fox-news/">Again</a> and <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/10/24/fox-news-murdoch-family-media/">again</a>. <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/07/10/the-problem-at-fox-news-is-not-just-tucker-carlson-its-the-murdoch-family-that-owns-and-controls-the-network/">Perhaps too much</a>. In fact, <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/06/29/james-rupert-murdoch-philanthropy-fox-news/">maybe I have a problem</a>. But the dilemma of Fox News and the Murdochs does not go away, it just gets worse. Government action is not the answer, as the protections of the First Amendment exist for good reason. The key question, in my mind, isn’t whether the government should allow the Murdochs to operate a racist cable network — they have that right — it’s whether major corporations should line up to do business with them.</p>
<p>The prospects are not good for a change of heart in corporate America. For instance, it’s impossible to imagine that Roger Goodell, the NFL commissioner who is paid $63 million a year by billionaire team owners to make as much money for them as possible, will suddenly decide to pull the plug on the league’s lucrative <a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/nfl-tv-rights-thursday-night-football-amazon-super-bowl-1234933792/">$2.3 billion-a-year contract</a> with Fox Sports. Goodell, remember, is the man who had no problem with the banishment of quarterback Colin Kaepernick for taking a knee during the national anthem to protest police violence against Black people.</p>
<p>But let’s think creatively. Fox Corp., the parent company of the Murdochs’ networks in the U.S., is a shareholder-owned firm in which the Murdochs have a controlling stake. What would happen to the share price if NFL players or their union spoke out against the owners of Fox Sports and called for the league to not renew its broadcast rights (which unfortunately don&#8217;t expire for a <a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/nfl-tv-rights-thursday-night-football-amazon-super-bowl-1234933792/">number of years</a>)? Alas, there’s a tremendous disincentive for players to criticize the Murdochs, because they could forget about ever being hired by Fox Sports as a commentator after they retire. And Goodell might be tempted to allow the Kaepernick treatment for any dissidents, meaning that their playing careers could be in jeopardy too. So this thought experiment isn’t encouraging.</p>

<p>How about the Murdochs in Hollywood? The major companies that will no longer put their ads on Fox News are glad to have their wares advertised on Fox television shows like &#8220;The Simpsons.&#8221; Corporations respond to consumers, and while consumers punish them for supporting political programs on Fox News, that’s not the case for sponsoring &#8220;The Masked Singer&#8221; on Fox TV. Absent consumer pressure, there’s no market-driven reason for any company to withdraw its ads from, say, &#8220;The Cleaning Lady.&#8221; Balance sheets do not have line items for doing the right thing by turning against the first family of &#8220;great replacement.&#8221;</p>
<p>What about the creative talent? While Hollywood proclaims itself to be devoutly anti-racist, there’s little sign that the enlightened writers, actors, and producers who create Murdoch’s entertainment programs are having second thoughts about who they work for. Susan Sarandon, famous for her political activism, was on the <a href="https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/fox-upfront-prerecorded-in-person-event-1235268542/">upfronts</a> stage last week to promote her new Fox show and did not, in front of Lachlan Murdoch, seize the moment to pull a Nan Goldin.</p>
<p>Goldin is an art photographer who set off a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by_aE_aMiHM&amp;t=1s">dramatic wave of protests</a> against the Sackler family — the owners of the pharmaceutical company that flooded the U.S. with the addictive painkiller OxyContin. Goldin became addicted to opioids after OxyContin was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/22/nan-goldin-interview-us-opioid-epidemic-heroin-addict-oxycontin-sackler-family">prescribed for her tendonitis</a>, and in 2018 she led a now-famous protest at the Sackler Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in which she and other activists threw prescription bottles into a reflecting pool and shouted “Sacklers lie, people die!” Those protests came amid a wave of lawsuits that recently culminated with a settlement in which the Sackler family <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/health/sacklers-purdue-oxycontin-settlement.html">agreed to pay</a> as much as $6 billion to communities harmed by the opioid epidemic and transfer ownership of Purdue Pharma. The family’s name has been taken down from the Met and other museums.</p>
<p>Lawsuits against the Murdochs have not gotten far because the First Amendment offers broad protections for news organizations and individuals in ways that no constitutional provision or law protects a pharmaceutical company. Proving direct harm from an opiate is far easier in a court of law than proving direct harm from a broadcast. There are exceptions, but they are narrow. While the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has been <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/how-infowars-host-alex-jones-pushed-first-amendment-its-limit-n1263135">sued into bankruptcy</a> for saying the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax, that&#8217;s because he was accused of defamation — making false statements about the parents of the slain students and causing them damage.</p>
<p>You never know what a bit of protesting might do, however. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s hard to find examples of anyone in the television business, even people who don’t currently work on Fox shows, protesting against the Murdochs in a consistent and public way. It’s a pattern that seems to affirm the silencing effect, in itinerant Hollywood, of not knowing who will sign your next paycheck. Though one exception is Judd Apatow, the prolific director and writer who for years has been drilling holes into the family Murdoch.</p>

<h2>Reporting the Murdochs</h2>
<p>There’s been extensive discussion in the media about needing to cover the GOP as an extremist entity that threatens democracy rather than as a standard political party. The same discussion should probably be raised about Fox and the Murdochs. Should they be covered as something other than a conservative news outlet with a cranky proprietor who enjoys watching his children battle each other for his attention and love? If so, what would that mean?</p>
<p>For a long time, news organizations have treated the Murdochs with generosity and indulgence, as a tale of financial success and succession intrigue. I’m not referring just to the usual suspects of CNBC and MarketWatch, but also the New York Times and the Washington Post, among others. Just watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT5xm1Kwb5U&amp;t=3s">this 2018 public interview</a> of Lachlan Murdoch by New York Times reporter Andrew Ross Sorkin and try not to cringe at Sorkin’s knee-bending solicitude. The only remotely tough question came during the audience Q&amp;A from a New Yorker reporter.</p>
<p>The Times has improved in the past few years, starting with an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/03/magazine/rupert-murdoch-fox-news-trump.html">excellent series</a> in 2019 that was headlined “How Rupert Murdoch’s Empire of Influence Remade the World.” In April, the Times published another <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/30/us/tucker-carlson-gop-republican-party.html">lengthy investigation</a>, “How Tucker Carlson Stoked White Fear to Conquer Cable.” But this kind of hard-nosed criticism remains patchy. In March, the Times published a puff piece about Kathryn Murdoch, the wife of James Murdoch, Rupert&#8217;s younger son. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/14/us/politics/murdoch-elections-donations.html">The article</a>, “How a Murdoch Hopes to Save American Democracy,” was more than 1,300 words of fluff about a supposedly centrist member of the Murdoch clan donating to nonpartisan causes. It neglected to mention that Kathryn Murdoch has never really criticized Fox News &#8212; the closest she has come is <a href="https://twitter.com/KathrynAMurdoch/status/1324719949789749250">saying on Twitter</a> that she agreed with a tweet in which Jake Tapper urged the Murdochs and Fox to put country before profits &#8212; and it failed to note that her husband played a loyal and key role in the family empire, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/business/media/james-murdoch-resigns-news-corp.html">stepping aside</a> in 2020 mainly because his father finally chose Lachlan as second-in-command.</p>
<p>One of the lessons of the past few years is that journalists need to call things by their names, and that means, when covering Fox News, naming not just the hosts who mouth the words that inspire violence, but the family that approves of these words and pays for them to be spread from coast to coast. This is a drum I’ve been <a href="https://twitter.com/maassp/status/1371621522574544898">banging</a> for <a href="https://twitter.com/maassp/status/1196091587517960197">a long time</a>, and while the coverage of the Murdochs has improved, it has a ways to go. In an otherwise <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2022/05/15/buffalo-suspect-great-replacement-theory-conservative-media/">acceptable news story</a> this week about the conservative media’s embrace of &#8220;great replacement&#8221; ideas, the Washington Post mentioned Tucker Carlson 15 times — but did not once mention the Murdochs.</p>

<u>He is the</u> president of a Slavic nation who takes advice from no one and gambles on a war that does not go as planned. Fierce resistance prevents his forces from seizing the capital he covets. Western sanctions send his economy into a tailspin, the middle class flees, and state media offers ridiculous propaganda (“Our enemy is bombing themselves”).</p>
<p>This sounds like Vladimir Putin in 2022, but it’s Slobodan Miloševi&#263; in 1992, when military forces under the Serbian leader’s control went on a genocidal rampage in Bosnia. The war dragged on for years and involved sieges of Sarajevo and other cities, including Srebrenica. Miloševi&#263; claimed Bosnia was an artificial country that didn’t deserve to exist — the kind of lie that Putin has deployed against Ukraine. Serbs shelled apartment buildings and attacked civilians as they tried to flee — just as the Russian army is now doing in Ukraine. You can look at a picture of <a href="https://twitter.com/SniperAlleyPhot/status/1499421194176638989">Sarajevo in 1992 and a picture of Kyiv in 2022</a> and not know which is which.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of guessing about what Putin will be able to achieve in Ukraine and whether he’ll survive in power, now that his opening gambit has failed. But there has been surprisingly little reference to the precedent of Miloševi&#263; and Bosnia. It’s as though what happened in Bosnia is not regarded as an authentic chapter of Europe’s history — because most of the war’s <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/09/01/bosnian-genocide-mass-shootings/">100,000 victims were Muslim</a>, and Muslims aren’t considered fully European. As the historian Edin Hajdarpaši&#263; <a href="https://twitter.com/_edinh/status/1499041070578995204"> noted</a> last week: “If 1990s Bosnia is taught, it is in courses on genocide &amp; violence, but rarely as part of European history courses.” It’s an omission that does more than reveal how prejudice tilts our choices about which history to highlight and which history to ignore; it deprives us of a greater understanding of what may lie ahead.</p>
<p>There are two sides to the lessons from Belgrade and Sarajevo. The first is that a leader who embarks on a violently nihilist path can remain in power far longer than you might expect. There is speculation about a possible <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/03/10/putin-coup-russia-siloviki/">coup</a> in Moscow, but Miloševi&#263; stayed in office throughout the war, which ended after four years, and wasn’t ousted until late in 2000 when he tried to rig an election that he lost. The second lesson is that an underdog fighting for survival can stave off, though with immense loss of life, a far larger force that lacks its motivation. The Bosnian Army was thrown together after the Serb onslaught began and persevered, despite an unconscionable arms embargo by the United Nations (imposed against all parties but hurting only the Bosnian side, because Serbs had plenty of weapons of their own).</p>
<p>It goes without saying — so of course I feel obliged to say it — that what happened a generation ago in the Balkans is not predictive of what will happen in Ukraine and Russia. The differences are considerable. In many ways, what we’re seeing in Ukraine is a speed-chess version of the wars in Bosnia, Chechnya, and Syria, with the pieces on the board now <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/03/11/nuclear-war-russia-ukraine-invasion-putin-biden/">including nuclear weapons</a>. But in addition to <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/love-thy-neighbor-a-story-of-war/9780679763895">covering the war in Bosnia</a>, I studied Russian at Leningrad State University back in the Soviet era and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1991/02/18/in-latvia-violence-and-fear-have-a-face/22dd47f4-7d8d-4e56-ad2c-6529a766ae3d/">occasionally</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1991/02/11/vote-buoys-lithuanians-but-goal-is-still-elusive/9eb873a3-4581-45e5-9ebb-a5abbbce88b2/">reported</a> from the USSR during its collapse and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/01/magazine/the-triumph-of-the-quiet-tycoon.html">afterward</a>, including a brief stint in Ukraine when it became independent (a story I wrote in 1991 was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1991/08/28/ukrainians-fear-border-disputes-could-bring-conflict-with-russia/f9307a11-21e9-450f-a246-c6dcff90905a/">headlined</a> “Ukrainians Fear Border Disputes Could Bring Conflict With Russia”). What is happening today is uncanny, an old tune played in a new key with a faster tempo and higher stakes.</p>

<h2>Staying in Power</h2>
<p>What is Putin’s endgame?</p>
<p>Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia and prominent commentator on the war, has given voice to a consensus view. “Putin has no endgame,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/mcfaul/status/1498711723783643141?s=11"> wrote</span></a> last week. “Even if he takes Kyiv, then what? Ukrainians will never submit to him. Never.” It’s true that Ukrainians have amply demonstrated they will not give up, but in the context of the Miloševi&#263; experience, McFaul’s assessment seems unimaginative.</p>

<p>Putin is a true believer in the idea of a greater Russia: He genuinely would like to return Russia to what he regards as its lost glory. Miloševi&#263;&#8217;s embrace of Serbian nationalism was different. He was opportunistic from the start; nationalism was just a vehicle to take him to power and keep him there. With Kyiv demonstrating that it will not become Russia’s property, Putin is moving toward Miloševi&#263;’s cynical position. As his army appears to move slowly, with large amounts of equipment abandoned and significant numbers of soldiers captured or killed, we’re already hearing less talk of national glory and territorial expansion. Staying in power — doing whatever is necessary to stay there — is the new endgame. The more clearly we understand that, the better we can understand what Putin’s tactics will be in the time ahead.</p>

<p>For context, let me take you back in time to the noisy dining room of the Serbian Parliament in Belgrade during the Miloševi&#263; era. It was late in 1992, when the war and genocide in Bosnia were searingly hot. Serbia was a strange place. It wasn’t a full dictatorship; there were some independent media outlets. If you didn’t like Miloševi&#263;, you could say so, within limits. The dining room was filled with political hacks and war criminals, as well as a handful of dejected reformers. One of them recognized me. He had been my interpreter a year earlier, but now he was a senior functionary in the federal Yugoslav government, a powerless entity that was nominally separate from Miloševi&#263;&#8217;s Serbian government, where all power resided. Laszlo sat down at my table and laughed when I remarked that Miloševi&#263; would not like the latest peace proposal because it wouldn’t give him the land he sought for a greater Serbia.</p>
<p>“Don’t ask what strategy is best for achieving a greater Serbia, or what strategy is best for the welfare of the Serbs,” Laszlo told me. “Ask what strategy will keep Miloševi&#263; in power, and that’s the one he will follow. All of these things that he talks about, like nationalism and protecting Serbs, are just tools that he uses to stay in power. He doesn’t care about them at all. He doesn’t care about anyone at all. He cares only about staying in power.”</p>

<p>The pursuit of violence was the best strategy for staying in power. War allowed Miloševi&#263; to drape his regime in the national flag and blame everything — the sanctions and corruption and penury and hyperinflation — on the supposed threats Serbs faced from Bosnia’s Muslims and America’s imperialism. Those excuses eventually ran out of steam, but Miloševi&#263; survived longer than expected by combining the rhetoric of national defiance with the cowardly violence of soldiers sitting in the hills and bombing civilians in the valleys below. Peace, when it finally came, was a tactic he used to maintain his rule. It was not his goal.</p>
<p>What does this tell us about Putin? It’s important to note, again, that it’s impossible for any of us to know what Putin will do or what’s going on in his head. But precedents are instructive.</p>
<p>Ben Judah, an Atlantic Council fellow who wrote a book about Putin, noted the other day that the structure of power in Russia is a “personalistic dictatorship.” Putin has been in charge for more than two decades and is surrounded by cowering “yes” men; just<a href="https://twitter.com/mmcintire/status/1498137121290395649"> watch the videos</a> of his meetings with his national security council, his generals, and top business executives. In a similar vein, when I <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1993/04/06/serbian-leader-lauds-us-for-avoiding-armed-role/490ebfea-ee5e-4b60-8588-e1766339a0ba/">interviewed Miloševi&#263;</a> in 1993, there was nobody else in his spacious office: no bodyguard, no note-taker, no media adviser. He ruled alone. The interests of men like Miloševi&#263; and Putin come before all else. “He could either suddenly declare ‘the anti-terror operation was a success’ or escalate dramatically,” Judah<a href="https://twitter.com/b_judah/status/1497988598137860098"> wrote on Twitter</a>, of Putin. “Depending on what he thinks is in it for him, he’s capable of ditching the offensive or ditching the entire economy as we’ve known it in massive escalation.”</p>
<p>The rationale for continued warfare is that it binds more Russians to Putin than would come from an acknowledgment of his blunder and withdrawal of his forces. Retreat, even if packaged as a victory by wringing a concession or two out of the Ukrainians, could wind up being a larger blow to his hold on power. The math could easily change, with Putin calculating that retreat would better serve his interests; this could happen anytime. But until then, the violence will carry on. The war crimes that horrify so many of us are unlikely to factor into his calculations, because he has done this before, in Chechnya as well as Syria, with no fallout at home. Witness, for instance, the news reports in which ordinary Russians<a href="https://twitter.com/CurrentTimeTv/status/1499475364078366729"> deny their forces are bombing</a> cities in Ukraine despite being shown evidence of it. Yes, these are early days, but denialism of this sort is not unusual years into wars and afterward too. It helps to remember that in the 1990s, only a small number of Serbs believed their forces in Bosnia were guilty of war crimes despite an inundation of proof. And they still feel that way. Despite an international tribunal ruling in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-ratko-mladic-europe-government-and-politics-4d2b4bc207af6ad523fea76ca7a14b3b">multiple cases</a> that Bosnian Serbs committed genocide, Serbia’s current president is none other than Alexander Vu&#269;i&#263;, a minister in Miloševi&#263;&#8217;s last government.<br />

<h2>Fighting for Weapons</h2>
<p>There is good news for Ukraine from Bosnia, and it has to do with weapons.</p>
<p>The Bosnia war began after a majority of voters cast their ballots in favor of independence from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia. The United Nations had placed an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_713">arms embargo</a> on Yugoslavia, using the rationale that more weapons would mean more fighting as the country broke up. In fact, the Serbs had plenty of weapons because they controlled the Yugoslav National Army and had open borders with the rest of the world to acquire whatever they did not already possess. The Bosnian government, on the other hand, had no weapons at the start and limited means to acquire them even illicitly, because it was mostly encircled by its Serb enemy and faced its off-and-on Croat allies elsewhere. The embargo meant only that the Serbs, who started the war, would never lose their advantage in armaments. At the end of one of my winter reporting trips to Sarajevo, I left my boots with my interpreter because his brother was on the snowy front lines in sneakers.</p>
<p>The Bosnian Army hung on and prevented Serb forces from overrunning Sarajevo and other chunks of the country that had not been conquered in the first months of the war, when the Serbs made most of their gains. This showed what can be achieved by a motivated army even if it is outmatched in firepower. Serb fighters were cowardly: At the war’s outset, they attacked towns that had no defenses, <a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2017/01/23/capturing-the-image-of-ethnic-cleansing-in-bosnia-01-19-2017/">shooting people at will</a>, and once the front lines were set, they squatted in the hills and shot at civilians from a distance. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1996/05/12/suddenly-they-are-killers/0f133d2f-f68a-4f40-9baf-2d2e15315337/">I visited Serb soldiers</a> in their mountain bunkers; they were glad to kill but afraid to put their lives on the line. When they finally starved and broke Srebrenica in 1995, they executed more than 8,000 men and boys.</p>
<p>The parallel to Ukraine is startling, with a crucial difference.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[9](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22left%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-left" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="left"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[9] -->Ukrainians are defending their homes and their independence. Russian soldiers do not really know what they are fighting for.<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[9] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[9] -->
<p>The Russian Army is massive compared to Ukraine’s, which is why Putin was so confident of prevailing in a matter of days, just as Miloševi&#263; did not anticipate fighting for years in Bosnia (<a href="https://iwpr.net/global-voices/plan-divide-bosnia-revealed">he had planned </a>to quickly carve up Bosnia between Serbia and Croatia). But the Ukrainians, like the Bosnian forces, are defending their homes and their independence. Russian soldiers do not really know what they are fighting for; many were reportedly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/russian-soldiers-ukraine-anger-duped-into-war">not even told </a>they would be invading Ukraine. Just as lackluster Serb forces resorted to indiscriminate fire against civilian targets, the Russians are falling back on that dismal strategy in Ukraine.</p>
<p>But here is a key distinction: While the Bosnian Army was starved of weapons due to the U.N. embargo, Ukraine has been preparing for this war since Russia seized Crimea in 2014; it has been getting support in this effort from the U.S. and its NATO allies. More to the point, it is now on the receiving end of a massive infusion of weapons in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/06/us/politics/us-ukraine-weapons.html">billions of dollars</a> and apparently growing by the day. I don’t think interpreters in Kyiv are finding it necessary to solicit donations of winter boots for their front-line siblings.</p>
<p>It was a journalist from Bosnia who made this comparative point the other day. “Don’t underestimate Ukraine,” Melina Bor&#269;ak<a href="https://twitter.com/MelinaBorcakEng/status/1497529108955287556"> wrote on Twitter</a>. “Bosnia was independent, but didn’t have an army when it was attacked. &#8230; There was an arms embargo, so we couldn’t even buy a handful of guns. Everyone thought, we will bleed out fast. We resisted for 4 YEARS.”</p>
<p>The resistance came at a terrible cost. Not just the 100,000 deaths, but the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/10/25/bosnia-war-us-election-politics/">physical and psychological scars</a> that millions of survivors carry to this day, as well as internal borders that divide Bosnia still, thanks to a peace treaty, negotiated at a U.S. military base, that gave half the country to the genocidal Serbs. Let us hope, this time, that the U.S. and its allies conduct themselves in a manner that helps Ukraine arrive at a fairer and quicker endgame of its own.</p>

<p><u>The Pentagon is</u> not known for staging revivals of classic movies, but it just reenacted a famous scene from “Casablanca.”</p>
<p>Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin — after months of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/12/18/us/airstrikes-pentagon-records-civilian-deaths.html">news reports</a> about civilians killed by U.S. bombs, including the deaths of seven children and three adults in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/us/politics/pentagon-drone-strike-afghanistan.html">Kabul drone attack</a> — just issued a directive to reduce what the military traditionally describes as collateral damage. “We can and will improve upon efforts to protect civilians,” Austin vowed this week. “The protection of innocent civilians in the conduct of our operations remains vital to the ultimate success of our operations, and as a significant strategic and moral imperative.”</p>
<p>His <a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/dod-improving-civilian-harm-mitigation-and-response/293b9907eefc2580/full.pdf">two-page directive</a> calls for the creation of a “Civilian Harm and Mitigation Response Plan” in 90 days that will lay out a comprehensive approach to improve the training of military personnel and the collection and sharing of data, so that the wrong people don’t get killed so often. He also ordered the establishment of a hazily defined “civilian protection center of excellence” to institutionalize the knowledge needed to prevent wrongful killings. The underlying idea is that military culture will be changed so that protecting civilians is a core goal.</p>

<p>If you were just tuning into the catastrophe of America’s forever wars, you might be impressed by Austin’s directive, in the same way you might be impressed by Capt. Louis Renault in “Casablanca” when he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjbPi00k_ME">shuts down</a> Rick’s Café because, shockingly, gambling was happening in the casino. Renault’s horror was feigned, of course. He was a regular visitor to the cafe, and after blowing his whistle on gambling, he was handed his winnings for that night.</p>
<p>It’s not as though the Pentagon is taking action — or pretending to take action, as is much more likely — because battlefield abuses have suddenly been brought to its attention. From the beginning, one of the hallmarks of the post-9/11 wars has been the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2016/04/28/searching-for-ground-truth-in-the-kunduz-hospital-bombing/">widely reported</a> <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2017/03/09/women-and-children-in-yemeni-village-recall-horror-of-trumps-highly-successful-seal-raid/">killing of civilians</a> by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/books/review/Hammer-t.html">U.S. forces</a>.

<p>There has even been a begrudging chorus of admissions by the Pentagon that go back more than a decade. In 2010, the Joint Chiefs of Staff completed its classified “<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/LarryLewis_/status/1378387139558268930">Joint Civilian Casualty Study</a>.” In 2013, a Pentagon office called Joint and Coalition Operational Analysis published a report titled “<a href="https://info.publicintelligence.net/JCOA-ReducingCIVCAS.pdf">Reducing and Mitigating Civilian Casualties: Enduring Lessons</a>.” The remarkable thing about that 2013 report — other than the fact that it included most of the remedies Austin mentioned this week — was that it contained a list of a dozen other reports on civilian casualties that JCOA alone had published in the previous five years.</p>
<p>And five years later, in 2018, the Joint Chiefs completed yet <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/u.s.-military's-2018-study-on-civilian-casualties/e39c5889-6489-4373-bd8e-ac2ca012e03d_note.html">another classified report</a> on civilian casualties. The Washington Post, which revealed its existence, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/after-bloody-insurgent-wars-pentagon-launches-effort-to-prevent-civilian-deaths/2019/02/04/ce5386d8-7fec-4fcf-9cda-60e06b638115_story.html">described that report</a> as “a major examination of civilian deaths in military operations, responding to criticism that [the Pentagon] has failed to protect innocent bystanders in counterterrorism wars worldwide.” Sound familiar? And that secret report came two years after President Barack Obama had <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/07/01/executive-order-united-states-policy-pre-and-post-strike-measures">issued an executive order</a> that said the military was killing too many civilians and needed to take a range of actions to change that.</p>

<p>You get the point. The Pentagon’s protestations of disappointment at what has happened, and its promises to do better, are the standard confetti of insincerity. In many ways, it’s similar to executives at Facebook expressing <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/19/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-privacy-apologies.html">dismay and regret</a> at some of the ways their platform <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/why-zuckerberg-15-year-apology-tour-hasnt-fixed-facebook/">has been</a> used and abused, and <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/03/06/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-privacy/">promising to do a better job</a>. The important thing to watch is not what powerful institutions promise to do but what they actually do. And when they do nothing after promising again and again to make changes, you would be foolish to regard their latest vow as meaningful.</p>
<p>“While a serious Defense Department focus on civilian harm is long overdue and welcome, it’s unclear that this directive will be enough,” <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-statement-pentagons-new-civilian-harm-directive">noted</a> Hina Shamsi, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s national security project. “What’s needed is a truly systemic overhaul of our country’s civilian harm policies to address the massive structural flaws, likely violations of international law, and probable war crimes that have occurred in the last 20 years.”</p>
<p>The best template for understanding the endurance of the Pentagon’s failures on civilian casualties might be its record on curbing sexual abuse in its ranks. This is a problem that has existed forever but jumped into the public realm in a particularly strong way with the <a href="https://www.retroreport.org/video/the-legacy-of-tailhook/">1991 Tailhook scandal</a>, when 83 women and seven men were sexually assaulted at a Navy conference in Las Vegas. Since then, the military has continually promised to do everything it could to fight sexual abuse. There has been no shortage of studies and plans and hearings, but the problem persists, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/magazine/military-sexual-assault.html">nearly one in four servicewomen</a> reporting sexual assault in recent studies, and more than half reporting sexual harassment.</p>
<p>There is now hope of real change after Congress finally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/us/politics/military-sexual-assault-congress.html">passed legislation</a> in December that transfers to independent military prosecutors the authority to pursue sexual assault cases. Under an executive order signed by President Joe Biden this week, sexual harassment has also been <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2022/01/26/sexual-harassment-in-the-military-now-a-crime-under-biden-order/">added as a crime</a> to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. These moves came more than three decades after Tailhook.</p>
<p>It would be good if we could save ourselves another decade or two of insincere Pentagon reports and jump forward to the day when commanders no longer have the ability to protect their subordinates, and themselves, by standing in the way of prosecutions after civilians are recklessly killed. (There was <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/12/26/us-military-impunity-generals-kabul-serbia/">no disciplinary action</a> taken against any soldier after the Kabul drone bombing, for instance.) But that day is probably a long way off, especially when the current defense secretary is a former general who for many years commanded U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there is one thing Biden could do that would show the government is just a little bit serious about reducing civilian casualties. Daniel Hale, who pleaded guilty to leaking classified military documents that revealed the scale of civilian killings by U.S. drones, is currently serving a 45-month sentence for violating the Espionage Act. He should be pardoned, to demonstrate that it was terribly wrong to punish someone who tried to stop the murder of innocent people.</p>
<p>“I stole something that was never mine to take — precious human life,” Hale<a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/07/27/daniel-hale-drone-leak-sentencing/"> said at his sentencing</a>. &#8220;I couldn’t keep living in a world in which people pretend that things weren’t happening that were. Please, your honor, forgive me for taking papers instead of human lives.”</p>

<u>It was the</u> winter of 1991, and the country I was working in, the Soviet Union, was months away from its demise. Yet the collapse, so close, was unimaginable.</p>
<p>Moscow was frigid and miserable. The currency was a wreck, stores had empty shelves, and the Kremlin seemed more of a ghost ship than command center. The country&#8217;s Baltic republics were seeking independence, and when I reported on the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1991/02/18/in-latvia-violence-and-fear-have-a-face/22dd47f4-7d8d-4e56-ad2c-6529a766ae3d/">violence</a> that had already occurred there, struggle and darkness were all that seemed possible.</p>
<p>I was visiting the Soviet Union to help my overworked colleagues from the Washington Post, and on one of my first nights, I had dinner with a few correspondents who lived in the country and knew what was going on — or were supposed to. They talked of a grim era ahead in which the KGB and the Soviet Army would rule the country, because its leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, was losing control; his reforms unleashed only discontent and poverty.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->
<p>A few years later, after the Soviet Union was no more, <a href="https://petermaass.com/love-thy-neighbor-epilogue/">I wrote about that dinner</a> and what would have occurred if I had known the future and told my friends about it. “If I would have suggested that, in six months, hard-liners might stage a coup against Gorbachev, and that the coup would fail and that the Soviet Union, which we all had grown up with and believed to be immortal, would die on the spot, breaking into bits and pieces with names like Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, my colleagues would have laughed and wondered whether my water glass was filled with vodka.”</p>
<p>The astounding thing isn’t that every warning light was flashing red in the winter of 1991 and we didn’t see them. We saw those lights. Everyone did. We couldn’t miss them. We knew there was danger. The astounding thing is that we couldn’t imagine their submerged meaning, the future they indicated.</p>
<p>One year after the storming of the U.S. Congress, it&#8217;s a good time to recognize that we are no longer observers of the distressed futures that afflict other people. We are those people now. It is we, not the out-of-luck them, who are at the mercy of nightmares. So today is a good day to understand what that means.<br />

<h2>Sinister Dimensions</h2>
<p>I am a glutton for dystopia. While covering the war in Bosnia, I read J.G. Ballard’s “High-Rise,” a 1970s novel about a luxury apartment building in London where the residents devolve into war against each other, begun by a dispute over a loud party. I can’t remember why I chose to read Ballard, but the first sentences of “High-Rise” spoke to what I was learning in the Balkans about the ways societies slip, without knowing it, into the realm of nightmares:</p>
<blockquote><p>Later, as he sat on his balcony eating the dog, Dr. Robert Laing reflected on the unusual events that had taken place within this huge apartment building during the previous three months. Now that everything had returned to normal, he was surprised that there had been no obvious beginning, no point beyond which their lives had moved into a clearly more sinister dimension.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even as Sarajevo suffered its first casualties in April 1992, <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/europe-failed-to-defend-its-values-in-sarajevo/a-38309545">during a peace march</a>, lots of people still couldn’t see what was in front of them: a genocidal war by Serbs against Muslims. There were plenty of flashing red lights before the shooting started, years before it started, in fact — the death of Yugoslav ruler Josip Broz Tito; the publication of a nationalist tract by the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts; the rise of Slobodan Miloševi? — but what did these things mean, what was the future they foretold?</p>
<p>These questions lead me to another book I read during my time in the Balkans, this one about the Balkans. Though Rebecca West’s “Black Lamb and Grey Falcon” is a classic that was published in 1941 and elicits some groans nowadays for its Serbian orientation, it has a line from its narrator that remains a truth bomb: “In writing this book I have been struck again and again by the refusal of destiny to let man see what is happening to him, its mean delight in strewing his path with red herrings.” These red herrings are somewhat universal: the plans we have, the dreams we covet, the delusions we nurture.</p>
<p>It would be wrong to punish ourselves over our inability to see the future. Who could be expected to realize that it wasn’t just a reality TV star but the next president of the United States who rode down an escalator at Trump Tower on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/13/donald-trump-presidential-campaign-speech-eyewitness-memories">June 16, 2015</a>, and implausibly announced, as he described Mexicans as rapists, that he wanted to be the 45th commander in chief? For that matter, how could a young reporter in Budapest in 1990 foresee that the cool 20-something anti-communist activist he interviewed from time to time, just elected to parliament, would become a racist and antisemitic prime minister one day? (The cool kid was Viktor Orbán, and the young reporter was me.)</p>
<p>Red herrings, everywhere.<br />

<h2>Patriot Games</h2>
<p>The warning lights have been flashing in America for a long time. We could start in 1619 or 1789 and jump forward 200 years to Lee Atwater, Ronald Reagan, and <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/02/19/rip-rush-limbaugh/">Rush Limbaugh</a>, for instance. What I saw in the Balkans makes me think the emergence of Fox News in 1996 was the trigger mechanism for our current predicament. It’s hard to overstate the necessity, if your goal is national madness, of mainstreaming racism and hatred — a function that was fulfilled by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/24/serbia-state-tv-apologises-propaganda">Radio Television of Serbia</a> before the Bosnia war.</p>
<p>The late <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/14/milos-vasic-obituary">Miloš Vasi?</a>, one of the most fearless journalists in Serbia during the 1990s, chronicled his homeland&#8217;s descent into extremism and corruption. Vasi? knew that the great unwinding in the former Yugoslavia was not a unique phenomenon. “All it took was a few years of fierce, reckless, chauvinist, intolerant, expansionist, war-mongering propaganda to create enough hate to start the fighting among people who had lived together peacefully for 45 years,&#8221; he <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1993/03/15/quiet-voices-from-the-balkans">said</a> in 1993. “You must imagine a United States with every little TV station everywhere taking exactly the same editorial line — a line dictated by David Duke. You, too, would have war in five years.”</p>
<p>The Murdoch family, which owns Fox News, has required more than five years to create an actual war in the U.S., but the network’s millionaire hosts are not without results, and they remain hard at work encouraging their mostly white viewers to be the worst they can be and feel like patriots. I think Vasi?, who died last year, would have a lot of wisdom to share about our January 6 anniversary, and some of it would revolve around Americans finally seeing they are not the well-mannered exception to internal calamity that they liked to believe themselves to be.</p>
<p>While it’s too much to expect we can foretell our future, we can know from the multitude of flashing lights that we have slipped into what Ballard would instantly diagnose as a sinister dimension. And our journey is not complete. Aleksandar Hemon, the Bosnian American writer, <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/05/02/trump-nationalism-violence-yugoslavia/">put it well</a>: “What the actual resolution might look like, I fear to envision, but I know it will not resemble anything Americans can remember or dare to imagine.”</p>
<p>The fortunate thing is that we don’t need to know precisely what the future holds. History, and the presence of 20 million assault rifles in America, provides us with enough data to know the outlines of what’s ahead if we continue to pretend that nightmares are for other countries, not ours.</p>

<p><u>My education in</u> wartime savagery started in Bosnia in the 1990s. Reporting on the war, I visited death camps, saw civilians get shot and beaten, interviewed torturers, and was arrested multiple times for being in the wrong place and asking too many questions. Despite all of that, <a href="https://petermaass.com/love-thy-neighbor-excerpt/">I sensed at the time</a> that my Balkan lessons were incomplete &#8212; and those instincts have been confirmed by the past 20 years of U.S. warfare in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria.</p>
<p>We tend to associate barbarism with the kind of things I saw in Bosnia: close-quarters violence in which the perpetrators look into the eyes of their victims and leave the fatal encounter with drops of blood on their boots. That’s an inadequate understanding because it excludes the killing-from-a-distance that is now central to America&#8217;s forever wars, which have increasingly moved away from ground combat. According to the nonprofit organization <a href="https://airwars.org/news-and-investigations/tens-of-thousands-of-civilians-likely-killed-by-us-in-forever-wars/">Airwars</a>, the U.S. has conducted more than 91,000 airstrikes in seven major conflict zones since 2001, with at least 22,000 civilians killed and potentially as many as 48,000.</p>

<p>How does America react when it kills civilians? Just last week, we learned that the U.S. military decided that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/13/us/politics/afghanistan-drone-strike.html">nobody will be held responsible</a> for the August 29 drone attack in Kabul, Afghanistan, that killed 10 members of an Afghan family, including seven children. After an internal review, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin chose to take no action, not even a wrist slap for a single intelligence analyst, drone operator, mission commander, or general. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby bizarrely <a href="https://twitter.com/dave_brown24/status/1471125871717146632">said</a>, “We acknowledge that there were procedural breakdowns” but that “it doesn’t necessarily indicate that an individual or individuals have to be held to account.”</p>
<p>There has been quite a lot of savagery-adjacent news to absorb this month. The New York Times just published a two-part series by Azmat Khan, based on military documents, revealing that U.S. bombings since 2014 have consistently killed civilians but that the Pentagon has done almost nothing to discern how many were harmed or what went wrong and might be corrected. As Khan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/19/magazine/victims-airstrikes-middle-east-civilians.html">noted</a>, “It was a system that seemed to function almost by design to not only mask the true toll of American airstrikes but also legitimize their expanded use.”</p>

<p>Savagery consists of more than the act of killing. It also involves a system of impunity that makes clear to the perpetrators that what they are doing is acceptable, necessary — maybe even heroic — and must not cease. To this end, the United States has developed a machinery of impunity that is arguably the most advanced in the world, implicating not only a broad swathe of military personnel but also the entirety of American society.</p>

<h2>Elite Accountability</h2>
<p>Impunity tends to begin at the top. No American general has been disciplined for overseeing the catastrophic wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, nor for <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Afghanistan-Papers/Craig-Whitlock/9781982159009">lying to Congress</a> about these disasters. The opposite has occurred: Stars have usually been added to their shoulders, and when they retire from the military, they <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/09/04/mcchrystal-afghanistan-navistar-consulting-generals/">tend to march</a> into <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/12/04/stanley-mcchrystal-risk-military-generals/">well-paid positions</a> as board members in the weapons industry or elsewhere (even though they are not strapped for resources, thanks to pensions that can reach $250,000 a year). The reputation-protection racket is so galling that an Army officer who served two tours in Iraq wrote a <a href="http://armedforcesjournal.com/a-failure-in-generalship/">now-famous article</a> in 2007 that noted: “A private who loses a rifle suffers far greater consequences than a general who loses a war.”</p>

<p>We should not be surprised. We are a society that excels in elite unaccountability. Just look at the number of bank CEOs who faced criminal charges after the 2008 financial collapse (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/05/books/review/the-chickenshit-club-jesse-eisinger-.html">zero</a>), or the number of Sackler family members who were criminally charged after their company, Purdue Pharma, started the opioid epidemic with OxyContin (<a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/01/1031053251/sackler-family-immunity-purdue-pharma-oxcyontin-opioid-epidemic">also zero</a>), or the number of billionaires who avoid paying income taxes (<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax">lots of them</a>). And let&#8217;s not forget the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/george-w-bush/">politicians</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/maassp/status/1108342115975790593">pundits</a> who goaded America into an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/16/iraq.iraq">illegal invasion</a> of Iraq in 2003 and suffered no consequences. It’s not clear who takes their cues from whom, but it is obvious that all of these elites benefit from the con.</p>
<p>Military impunity is somewhat unique because it stretches downward, too. If an intelligence analyst or drone operator or fighter pilot follows orders and procedures for an airstrike that kills dozens of civilians in a wedding party — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/05/world/asia/05iht-afghan.3.17553439.html">which has happened</a> — they need to be excused of wrongdoing. After all, who gave the orders, and who set the procedures? These questions would require looking up the chain of command, and for that reason, they are not asked with any intention of finding the answers. That’s why it was with no sense of alarm that secret military documents <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/drone-papers/manhunting-in-the-hindu-kush/">published by The Intercept</a> in 2015 noted that in a two-year campaign called Operation Haymaker, 9 of 10 Afghans killed in U.S. drone strikes were not the intended targets. For the U.S., this was the acceptable cost of doing business.</p>

<p>The Pentagon&#8217;s culture of impunity for killing civilians stands in contrast to its zealous pursuit of soldiers for other offenses. Unlike the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates the financial industry, or the IRS, which oversees taxpayers, or the Senate and House ethics committees, which keep an eye on members of Congress, the U.S. military has wide authority and deep resources to impose an array of penalties, from pay reductions to loss of rank and <a href="https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2019/07/30/what-death-row-executions-may-mean-for-these-four-soldiers-at-leavenworth/">death sentences</a>. The military avidly uses these powers, too. In 2020 alone, there were more than <a href="https://jsc.defense.gov/Portals/99/Documents/Combined%20Final%20Article%20146a%20Reports%20FY20.pdf?ver=JHm4UBFAgyxujbHdt-opQA%3d%3d">37,000 cases of discipline</a> in the armed forces, and since 2001, there have been more than 1.3 million cases.</p>
<p>Yet these powers have been used sparingly or not at all when it comes to airstrikes that kill civilians. One of the worst massacres in two decades of warfare occurred not long ago, on March 18, 2019, when U.S. warplanes dropped bombs that killed scores of civilians, mostly women and children, in an Islamic State enclave in Syria. The carnage was immediately apparent. As the Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/13/us/us-airstrikes-civilian-deaths.html">reported last month</a>, an analyst who watched the attack on a drone video typed into a secure chat system, “Who dropped that?” Another analyst wrote, “We just dropped on 50 women and children.” A quick battle assessment settled on 70 people killed.</p>
<p>A legal officer flagged it as a possible war crime that warranted an investigation, the Times noted, “but at nearly every step, the military made moves that concealed the catastrophic strike.” The Pentagon’s inspector general looked into what happened, but even its report was “stalled and stripped of any mention of the strike.” An evaluator who worked on the inspector general&#8217;s report, Gene Tate, was forced out of his job after complaining about the lack of progress and honesty. Tate told the Times: “Leadership just seemed so set on burying this.”</p>
<p>I could go on for thousands of words describing other airstrikes that killed civilians and resulted in no discipline or slight reprimands that were issued only after embarrassing reports from news organizations and human rights groups. For instance, there was a 2015 airstrike on a <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2016/04/28/searching-for-ground-truth-in-the-kunduz-hospital-bombing/">hospital in Kunduz</a><a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2016/04/28/searching-for-ground-truth-in-the-kunduz-hospital-bombing/">, Afghanistan,</a> that killed 42 patients and staffers; the military’s reluctant discipline included counseling and retraining for some of the personnel involved. The point is this: A military establishment that has enthusiastically enforced requirements for things as petty as <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.694.1079&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">wearing a reflector belt</a><a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.694.1079&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"> while jogging</a> has consistently failed to discipline soldiers for wrongful bombings that its own battle assessments acknowledge have killed civilians.</p>
<p>The machinery of impunity actually has two missions: The most obvious is to excuse people who should not be excused. The other is to punish those who try to expose the machine, because it does not function well in daylight. That’s why Daniel Hale, an Air Force veteran whom the government accused of leaking those classified drone documents to The Intercept, <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/07/27/daniel-hale-drone-leak-sentencing/">was sentenced</a> under the Espionage Act to nearly four years in prison. It is not the act of killing civilians that will result in definite and heavy punishment, but <em>exposing</em> the act of killing.</p>

<h2>Undoing Impunity</h2>
<p>In 1992, I interviewed a Muslim girl in Bosnia who had been raped. “The Višegrad warlord took a fancy to her,” I later <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Love-Thy-Neighbor-Story-War/dp/0679763899">wrote</a>, “and one night dragged her and her younger sister away from their mother, who of course was crying hysterically and holding onto the legs of the warlord, who kicked her away and shouted, ‘I am the law.’”</p>
<p>The warlord’s name was Milan Luki&#x107;, and he was one of the most evil men in a war that had a surplus of them. He killed women and children with particular ruthlessness, one time setting fire to a house in which 59 civilians were sheltering; they all perished. But Luki&#x107; was saying one honest thing when he kidnapped the sisters: He <em>was</em> the law. His paramilitary thugs had a monopoly on violence in Višegrad and the full support of Serb political and military authorities. At the time, I didn&#8217;t imagine that their crimes would catch up with any of them.</p>
<p>My interest right now is in the durability of these machines of impunity, not the comparative depravity of the crimes they protect (what happened in Bosnia was genocide). It seems ridiculous to think that the U.S. military’s cover-ups will be undone. The Pentagon is now getting even more support from the country in a form that is easy to measure and crucial to sustaining its clout: funding. Congress has just passed a military budget of <a href="https://www.vox.com/22840615/us-defense-spending-increase-afghanistan-withdrawal">$768 billion</a>, which is more than was allocated in 2020, even though U.S. troops withdrew this year, in a humiliating fashion, from their forever war in Afghanistan. Despite what has happened, America&#8217;s elected representatives are not loosening their protective embrace of the Pentagon.</p>
<p>Yet the impunity that seemed eternal in Bosnia turned out to be short-lived, at least for the elites of criminality. Luki&#x107; is now in prison with a life sentence, thanks to <a href="https://www.icty.org/sid/10188">his conviction</a> at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia for crimes against humanity. Key wartime leaders were extradited to the Hague too. Slobodan Miloševi&#x107;, the president of Serbia, died of a heart attack before his trial concluded, but Radovan Karadži&#x107; and Ratko Mladi&#x107;, the political and military leaders of Bosnia&#8217;s Serbs, were convicted of genocide.</p>
<p>America in 2021 is not Serbia in 1995. Our machinery of impunity is not susceptible to pressure from larger nations. But the journalists, whistleblowers, and researchers who have done the hard work of exposing its lies — they are still at work. One thing I’ve learned over the years is that the more these people uncover, the harder they toil. I wouldn’t bet against them.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Michael Dowling made</u> an unorthodox move when the Covid-19 pandemic got underway. Dowling is the chief executive of the largest hospital network in New York, and he decided that instead of barring journalists from Northwell Health’s facilities, he would let a documentary team inside one of its hospitals.</p>
<p>A prominent figure in the U.S. health care industry, Dowling was making a radical break from other CEOs. As people stricken with Covid-19 began to perish, most hospitals closed their doors to journalists, claiming that patient privacy had to be protected and that outsiders who weren’t medical professionals might contract the virus or get in the way of their swamped staffs. Dowling had been a top health official in New York during the AIDS epidemic and didn’t think that it would be a problem.</p>
<p>He was right.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>The journalists he let inside Long Island Jewish Medical Center were led by an award-winning director, Matthew Heineman, whose just-released documentary, “<a href="https://films.nationalgeographic.com/the-first-wave">The First Wave</a>,” is being hailed for its <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2021/11/19/first-wave-documentary-heineman/">up-close realism</a> of a hospital at the pandemic’s outset. There were none of the disasters that other hospital executives claimed to fear if they granted access to journalists: No violations of patient privacy occurred, none of Heineman’s team contracted the virus, and the hospital’s staff has warmly embraced the film.</p>
<p>With the Omicron variant starting to overwhelm the U.S., the lessons learned from Northwell&#8217;s experience are timely in the extreme: hospitals do not have valid excuses for keeping journalists out, and letting reporters inside will confront skeptics with graphic evidence that might sway some of them.</p>

<h3>Telling the Real Story</h3>
<p>In an interview with The Intercept, Dowling became the first senior executive in the health care industry to say publicly that it was a mistake for hospital leaders to stand in the way of journalists trying to report on the fatal seriousness of Covid-19.</p>
<p>“I think they were unsure whether they can trust what goes on inside their organization,” Dowling said. “They were wondering, &#8216;Well, this is dangerous, why would you do that, you’ll never know what will come of it, this could be a disastrous [news] report, it could all be negative about mistakes that are made.’” He added, “But that’s the risk you take, and I’m not afraid of taking risks like this. Because I believe, especially in this case, telling the real story was important.”</p>
<p>As <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/11/13/covid-pandemic-hidden-toll-hospitals/">previously reported by The Intercept</a>, the general exclusion of journalists from U.S. hospitals early in the pandemic meant that there were scant photos or videos of patients afflicted with the virus. This paucity of graphic imagery came at a malleable time when Americans were making up their minds on whether lockdowns and other anti-Covid measures were truly necessary. While it is impossible to say whether stronger visual evidence would have diminished the skepticism that took root in the early days, a number of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/opinion/coronavirus-photography.html">academics</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DrPoorman/status/1275282863835889664">doctors</a> believe that would have been the case.</p>

<p>The pandemic has exposed how the documentation of what’s unfolding in an emergency room or intensive care unit can have a real impact on public safety and national politics. In less fortunate countries that have been consistently rattled by war or natural disasters, hospitals are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/18/world/a-sarajevo-hospital-works-in-horror-beyond-anything.html">common locations of newsgathering</a>, because that’s where the casualties and their truths are found. If climate change and political turmoil in the U.S. lead to a greater number of mass casualty events, hospitals will increasingly become contested spaces where corporations come into conflict with journalists trying to report the news that&#8217;s unfolding behind their closed doors.</p>
<p>The head of the American Hospital Association, Richard Pollack, declined an interview request for this story. The AHA provided a vague statement from Nancy Foster, its vice president of quality and patient safety policy, who noted that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health authorities recommended that hospitals restrict outsider access to prevent the spread of Covid and that even family members were not let inside at the pandemic’s outset. “Media visitation policies always prioritize patient safety and privacy, along with whether hospitals have the material and staffing resources to ensure members of the media can visit safely and without unduly disrupting patient care,” her statement said.</p>

<h3>Taking Care of Business</h3>
<p>Hospitals are big business. The largest network in the country, HCA Healthcare, had revenues of more than $51 billion in 2020, and its CEO was paid more than $30 million that year. The educational and professional <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/rankings-and-ratings/the-7-highest-paid-health-system-ceos.html">profiles of the industry’s CEOs</a> tend to be little different from those in other fields: While some have medical backgrounds, most worked their way to the top as managers and began their careers with business degrees. The prospect of letting journalists roam around their facilities during a pandemic is about as welcome to them as it would be for executives at Facebook or Exxon Mobil to let reporters attend strategy meetings during a public relations crisis.</p>
<p>In most ways, Northwell is a typical health care company. Like many, it is structured as a nonprofit, though the business practices of these nonprofits are largely indistinguishable from for-profit networks. Dowling is paid very well for his services — more than $4 million in 2019, according to the <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/display_990/112965586/04_2021_prefixes_06-13%2F112965586_201912_990_2021040217860586">latest salary information</a> available, and 14 other executives at Northwell earned in excess of $1 million that year. The company has acted aggressively to collect unpaid bills: In 2020, as most hospitals in New York ceased legal actions against overdue patients because of the pandemic, Northwell sued more than 2,500 people for an average of about $1,700 plus interest, according to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/05/nyregion/coronavirus-medical-debt-hospitals.html">New York Times</a>, which described it as “a flood of litigation even as the pandemic has led to widespread job losses.” (A Northwell spokesperson told The Intercept that more than half of those suits were filed by hospitals affiliated with the network but not owned by it.)</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[4](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[4] -->
<p>When it comes to media relations, Northwell is an outlier. In the 1980s and 1990s, Dowling was a senior official in Gov. Mario Cuomo&#8217;s administration, serving as health director and deputy secretary to the governor, which means that Dowling came into health care management after public service rather than business school. “I spent 12 years in government where I was in front of the media all the time,&#8221; Dowling recalled. &#8220;I was not uncomfortable with that at all.”</p>
<p>In 2001, Dowling was selected as the leader of what was then called North Shore-LIJ Health System, which in 2016 was rebranded as Northwell Health; the company now has more than 75,000 employees and annual revenue of about $15 billion. Dowling has become the most visible executive in New York’s hospital industry — according to the LexisNexis database, he was mentioned in far more news articles from 2018 to 2020 than the CEOs of other hospital systems that are more famous, such as Memorial Sloan Kettering, NYU Langone Health, and Mount Sinai Health System. Dowling even has an <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelJDowling">active Twitter account</a>, unlike the other CEOs.</p>
<p>His profile during the first year of the pandemic was enhanced by a close association with Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the son of Dowling’s former boss. Dowling assumed an unofficial position as Cuomo’s top Covid adviser in the private sector, often appearing at press conferences with him. When the time came for the first FDA-approved doses of the Covid vaccine to be delivered at the end of 2020, a nurse and doctor at Northwell were selected to receive them — a boon for the company’s profile, as the event was broadcast <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/14/us/coronavirus-vaccine-first-shot/index.html">live by CNN</a> and showed Dowling standing beside nurse Sandra Lindsay and Dr. Yves Duroseau.</p>

<h3>Practice for a Pandemic</h3>
<p>In what turned into an unintended dry run for the pandemic, Northwell gave a green light in 2017 for a documentary team to film at its Lenox Hill Hospital. The team worked there until the end of 2019 and crafted an eight-episode series for Netflix called “<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80201728">Lenox Hill</a>” that came out in 2020. An extra episode was added after the team was allowed to return to Lenox Hill as the pandemic began. So at the start of the Covid-19 crisis, Dowling actually had two teams of independent journalists inside his hospitals: one at Lenox Hill, the other at Long Island Jewish.</p>
<p>“This was not a big leap for us at all,” he said. “We have been doing these kinds of things for years.”</p>
<p>A key concern expressed by hospitals is that a journalist might disclose the name or identity of a patient without their consent, violating the privacy law known as HIPAA and potentially leading to heavy fines. But there’s a simple workaround that Northwell reached with the Netflix team and with Heineman’s team: The hospital was allowed to view a rough cut of their work before broadcast to make sure that every patient who was identified had given their consent.</p>
<p>“We had gone through that experience, we knew the protocols that would have to be followed, we knew the privacy issues that we had to deal with,” Dowling said. “I had other hospital CEOs say to me, &#8216;Man, this is crazy that you allow people to sit in your hospital watching everything that goes on full time for months on end.’ My attitude is, I’m OK with it.”</p>
<p>Most CEOs were not OK with it. Their decisions to ban reporters, taken one by one and with an impact that was collective, helped turn the sudden battle against Covid-19 into a long war with hundreds of thousands of victims whose terrifying plight could not be witnessed. This spared Americans from the medieval inconvenience of seeing the suffering and death of a plague in their midst. In its first months, the pandemic was defined by empty streets and grounded planes, by 6 feet of distance between nervous people, and by the strained faces of hospital workers who were swamped and frightened.</p>
<p>The enemy was microscopic, and its victims were invisible.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>It is time</u> to make a strange addition to the shortlist of essential documents on the dishonesty of America’s generals: a new book from retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal titled “Risk: A User’s Guide.”</p>
<p>McChrystal was removed from his command by President Barack Obama but afterward created a thriving consulting firm and often appears on TV to talk about war and politics. His new book is intended to be a primer for corporate leaders trying to navigate the perils of doing business in America. The conceit is straightforward: Hello, I am a retired four-star general who bravely led troops into battle, and I can tell you everything you need to know about managing risk.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>There is a lot that McChrystal might teach us, because he was responsible for a series of consequential errors from which valuable lessons could be learned. Those errors include the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/20/AR2009092002920.html">concoction of a plan</a> in 2009 to defeat the Taliban insurgency by <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/09/02/afghanistan-obama-war-biden/">flooding Afghanistan</a> with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/world/asia/06reconstruct.html">as many as 80,000</a> additional U.S. soldiers. This was the kind of troops-and-money strategy that succeeded mainly in killing lots of civilians and helping the Taliban return to power.</p>

<p class="caption">A cover of Stanley McChrystal&#8217;s latest book, &#8220;Risk: A User&#8217;s Guide.&#8221;</p>
<!-- END-CONTENT(photo)[1] --></div><!-- END-BLOCK(photo)[1] -->On a less catastrophic scale, McChrystal <a href="https://jonkrakauer.medium.com/general-stanley-mcchrystal-continues-to-elude-accountability-for-covering-up-the-fratricide-of-pat-d9e6d20d40ab">actively participated</a> in the cover-up of the friendly fire killing of NFL player-turned-soldier Pat Tillman, whose 2004 death the Pentagon initially blamed on the Taliban, knowing that this was untrue. McChrystal also took the ill-advised risk of allowing a Rolling Stone reporter to embed with his entourage on a trip around Europe, and the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/the-runaway-general-the-profile-that-brought-down-mcchrystal-192609/">resulting article</a>, which conveyed the general’s disdain for America’s elected leaders, led to his early retirement in 2010.</p>
<p>I am not arguing that McChrystal should abstain from writing about risk or suggesting that he didn’t have wartime successes. A book that intelligently drew from both sides of his military career could be useful. But that is not the book McChrystal chose to write, and for that we should be grateful, because he has instead provided us with a far more important document. “Risk” is stuffed with so many displays of dishonesty, ignorance, and banality that it’s the ultimate self-own for a generation of generals who led America into disaster after 9/11 — and profited from it.</p>
<p>With his new book, McChrystal turns himself into an accidental whistleblower.</p>
<h3>Fighting the Truth</h3>
<p>There is a basic question to ask before buying a general’s advice book: Why are we listening to this guy?</p>
<p>America treats its generals as revered proxies for its ordinary soldiers, loving them even though the wars they&#8217;ve presided over have been catastrophic. There has been more than $14 trillion in defense spending since 9/11, more than 7,000 U.S. soldiers dead in Iraq and Afghanistan, and at least several hundred thousand civilians killed (which is a <a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/human/civilians">conservative estimate</a>). Throughout these calamities, the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/09/08/afghanistan-iraq-generals-soldiers-disciplined-911/">generals lied</a> about what was happening, telling Congress and the American public that things were going well when they knew it wasn&#8217;t true. The breathtaking scale of their deceit was revealed in classified documents that the Washington Post published in an award-winning 2019 series titled “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/afghanistan-papers/afghanistan-war-confidential-documents/">At War With the Truth</a>.”</p>
<p>Their failures have occurred outside the battlefield too.</p>

<p>One of the most venerated generals of recent times is James Mattis, who commanded U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan and went on to become President Donald Trump’s first defense secretary. Before joining the Trump administration, Mattis was on the board of directors of Theranos to provide advice on “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/22/james-mattis-testifies-in-elizabeth-holmes-theranos-fraud-trial.html">building elite teams</a>.” He <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/8/31/20839873/james-mattis-book-theranos">received</a> an annual stipend of $150,000 and continued to defend Theranos even after the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901">revealed</a> in 2015 that the company’s blood-testing machines were fraudulent. Testifying in September at the trial of the company’s founder, Elizabeth Holmes, Mattis avidly threw her under the bus, saying that he was “disappointed at the level of transparency from Ms. Holmes.”</p>
<p>A different type of flameout happened to retired Gen. David Petraeus, another famous commander of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan who served as Obama’s director of the CIA. Petraeus didn’t last long at Langley because he was having an affair with his biographer and shared classified information with her. The tradecraft he employed to covertly communicate with her was amateurish: They used the drafts folder in a shared Gmail account. And while in Afghanistan, his military aides <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/12/13/david-and-paula/">were excluded</a> from helicopter trips so that his secret girlfriend could ride along. Petraeus resigned from the CIA and <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2015/03/03/petraeus-plea-deal-reveals-two-tier-justice-system-leaks/">pleaded guilty</a> to mishandling classified information, but he’s still respected and has a lucrative partnership at KKR, a private equity firm.</p>
<p>One more item from the annals of generals gone bad:</p>
<p>There’s retired Gen. Michael Flynn, who headed the Defense Intelligence Agency and briefly served as Trump’s national security adviser until it was realized that he had deceived Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with a Russian diplomat. After <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/01/trumps-ex-national-security-adviser-michael-flynn-charged-with-lying-to-fbi">pleading guilty</a> to lying to the FBI, Flynn became a <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/06/27/qanon-michael-flynn-digital-soldiers/">star</a> of the QAnon conspiracy crowd and called for America to have <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/15/politics/michael-flynn-one-religion/index.html">one religion</a> (no prizes for guessing which one). His leap into the world of the unhinged is not unique. Retired Brig. Gen. Donald Bolduc, who served 10 tours in Afghanistan and led Special Operations Command Africa, is a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in New Hampshire and has described the state’s governor, also a Republican, as a “<a href="https://nhjournal.com/bolduc-i-drove-communist-sympathizer-sununu-out-of-senate-race/">Chinese communist sympathizer</a>.”</p>

<p>You get the point. Putting aside the conspiracy theories, corporate frauds, and the sharing of classified documents with persons not authorized to receive them (your girlfriend), there is little evidence that the experience gained by generals translates into business acumen. In fact, there is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1544612321000696">evidence</a> that companies with military officers on their boards have worse outcomes than their competitors. It’s hard to imagine two cultures more different. In the military, a general can order the court-martial of a subordinate for disobeying orders. In the corporate world, Elon Musk is powerful, but he can’t send lazy workers to prison. The skills used to organize a sales team for another round of cold calls are not what you need to lead Delta Force operators into mortal combat. And lest we forget, the U.S. military <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/07/26/military-sexual-assault-whistleblower-suspension/">has</a> a <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/07/06/military-africa-sexual-assault/">culture</a> of <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/04/02/female-soldier-sexual-assault-22-troops-fort-sill/">sexual assault</a> and <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/10/03/okinawa-sexual-crimes-us-military/">harassment</a> that has resisted decades of reform efforts.</p>
<h3>Gladwell for Dummies</h3>
<p>McChrystal appears to have the distinction of making more money from his military service than any U.S. general of his generation.</p>
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/09/04/mcchrystal-afghanistan-navistar-consulting-generals/">investigation</a> by the Washington Post, McChrystal has served as a board member or adviser to at least 10 companies since leaving the military. He was paid more than $1 million for serving on the board of just one firm, Navistar International, which also paid $50 million to the government to settle accusations that it fraudulently overcharged the Marine Corps for armored vehicles. McChrystal also drew $70,000 for a single speech at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln and <a href="https://twitter.com/isaacstanbecker/status/1435694721591123974">$50,000</a> for an engagement at California Polytechnic State University. Both are public institutions not known to be awash with funds.</p>
<p>The engine of McChrystal’s business endeavors is his eponymous McChrystal Group, which has more than 50 employees and provides consulting services to corporate and government clients. While “Risk” is written in the first person, McChrystal has a co-author, Anna Butrico, who is an associate at his firm. References to the firm are scattered throughout the book, and its acknowledgments section gives credit to about a dozen employees who provided ideas and assistance. The book is prominently featured on the website of McChrystal Group.</p>

<p>The book is dishonest because it ignores or distorts the risks undertaken by McChrystal that failed. This includes the Tillman episode but most crucially the disastrous war strategies in Afghanistan and Iraq. While there are boastful passages about military missions in Iraq that are portrayed as successful — special forces would &#8220;identify and engage enemy fighters with stunning speed,&#8221; McChrystal claims — the abundant errors made there are basically unmentioned. More to the point, the handful of pages about Afghanistan skate past colossal failures in which McChrystal was deeply complicit. Violent raids by forces under his command are described only as creating “extraordinary political controversy” because they were “antithetical to the Afghan culture.” Nowhere does McChrystal admit the actual reason for the controversy: U.S. and Afghan forces killed an unconscionable number of civilians, and in some instances, the violence constituted war crimes.</p>
<p>Much of the book is not lies, just utter banality. It is a torrent of platitudes like this: “Fear of change is only natural — adaptability requires the ability, willingness, and, I’d argue, courage to dare to become something different.” Or this assemblage of clichés: “Knowing that transformation is inevitable, we can ensure that we’re asking the right questions of ourselves and our teams to calibrate to our new reality in order to be successful in an increasingly digitized world.” And this insight: “Against the greatest threats, winning is most often the product of teamwork.”</p>
<p>The book moves from one bromide to another with eighth grade-level graphics, and one of its key messages is perplexing from a grammatical perspective: that “the greatest risk to us &#8212; is us.” It evokes famous events or personalities to make points that are manifestly self-evident, with references to the Alamo, Google, Apollo 13, Aunt Jemima, Martin Luther King Jr., Joseph Goebbels, Blockbuster, Enron, Lehman Brothers, &#8220;The Wizard of Oz,&#8221; the Bay of Pigs, Greta Thunberg, Napster, Gettysburg, the Maginot Line, Coco Chanel, Hurricane Katrina, and the Fosbury Flop, among others. One can imagine McChrystal’s agent pitching the germ of this book as &#8220;Malcolm Gladwell for Dummies.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Manufacturing Fame</h3>
<p>It’s harmless, you might think. What could be so terrible about a retired general making a few bucks with potted wisdom from West Point and the Sunni Triangle? We can even enjoy a cynical laugh, if we wish, watching a grift come to life as corporate executives make <a href="https://www.mcchrystalgroup.com/library/risk-a-users-guide/bulk-book-order/">bulk purchases</a> of “Risk” and do <a href="https://yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/3402-forever-young">calisthenics at dawn</a> with Navy SEALs hired by McChrystal Group. The gullible marks get what they deserve, which is nothing. But I can’t steer my thoughts away from the sacrifices of the soldiers and civilians I met while covering the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I think few of them are pleased or amused by the ease with which fortune and fame are showered on generals who got so many people killed and maimed. Many would regard it as an injustice.</p>
<p>The villain in this story isn’t really McChrystal or his book. He’s doing what Americans are encouraged to do: Swim toward available commercial opportunities and make as much money as you can without breaking the law. Maybe he doesn’t need all that extra cash — generals can receive <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/01/07/military-pensions-four-star-officers/4359023/">more than $250,000</a> in annual retirement pay, after all — but how many people would turn down the partnerships and board seats that are offered to former generals?</p>
<p>The deeper problem, I think, is the adulation that McChrystal and other military leaders get from media organizations. They manufacture the fame that is so misplaced. Here, for instance, is a partial list of the outlets that gave fawning coverage to the rollout of “Risk”: <a href="https://www.axios.com/stanley-mcchyrstal-risk-book-57bc8c59-0d99-495d-b201-d35faa09712a.html">Axios</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cnn/videos/retired-general-on-greatest-risk-to-america/671989603685018/?__so__=permalink&amp;__rv__=related_videos">CNN</a>, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/gen-stan-mcchrystal-sees-parallels-between-jan-6-nazis-87s2l/">PBS</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/washington-post-live/2021/10/04/path-forward-mastering-risk-with-gen-stanley-mcchrystal-us-army-ret-anna-butrico/">the Washington Post</a>, <a href="https://time.com/6103633/stanley-mcchrystal-afghanistan-risk-book/">Time magazine</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2021/10/31/why-the-biggest-risk-in-digital-transformations-is-often-the-c-suite-itself/?sh=2067fdd3144a">Forbes</a>, <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/andrea-mitchell-reports/watch/retired-gen-mcchrystal-the-taliban-will-look-inside-for-help-making-it-more-difficult-for-women-or-look-outside-for-international-aid-123359813798">MSNBC</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/05/1043376695/you-are-not-your-job-new-book-offers-a-guide-for-managing-risks">NPR</a>, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/general-stanley-mcchrystal-on-afghanistan-and-new-book-risk-a-users-guide/?intcid=CNM-00-10abd1h">CBS News</a>, <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/influencers-andy-serwer-stanley-mcchrystal-100000346.html">Yahoo Finance</a>, and <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/podcasts/foreign-policy-playlist/risk-and-its-calculus/">Foreign Policy</a>.

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>At Long Island</u> Jewish Medical Center, a loudspeaker announces an emergency in one of the rooms. It is March 2020, and the Covid-19 pandemic has just begun to take hold in the U.S. A team of nurses and doctors in the hospital is preparing a patient for intubation. A doctor leans over the patient, whose name is Patrick George.</p>
<p>“George,” the doctor shouts, “do you want to be put on a respirator?”</p>
<p>“Put me on,” George responds weakly.</p>
<p>“We’ll let your family know, OK?” the doctor says.</p>
<p>George is struggling to breathe and knows it’s his last hope.</p>
<p>“Put me on now,” he says.</p>
<p>If you have survived the pandemic without going inside a Covid ward, you will likely be stunned by the grim intimacy of this scene and the fact that you are witnessing it, with real-time urgency, in Matthew Heineman’s new documentary, &#8220;The First Wave.&#8221; The scene offers the kind of life-and-death drama that medical staffs have staggered through every day while the rest of us rarely or never saw it. We were — and are — isolated from the traumatic realities inside U.S. hospitals as more than 750,000 souls perished from the virus.</p>

<p>This opening scene, not yet 30 seconds long, twists in ways you cannot forget.</p>
<p>A nurse puts a phone, encased in a plastic bag, in front of George’s face. On the other end, seeing him via FaceTime, is George’s wife.</p>
<p>“I love you, baby,” she cries out.</p>
<p>“I love you too,” George responds.</p>
<p>“OK, be strong.”</p>
<p>“Bye,” George says.</p>
<p>“I love you,” she repeats.</p>
<p>“Bye bye,” George says. “Bye bye bye bye bye bye.”</p>
<p>This scene is not done with us but I won’t say what happens next. What I can say is that “The First Wave” is necessary to watch. Unless you have already seen and heard the kinds of events it shows, you have an incomplete understanding of the pandemic and of what three-quarters of a million deaths mean — when instead of a statistic in a news story, the casualties are a man on his back, his wife on the phone, and the nurses and doctors doing everything they can to save his life.</p>

<p>The saving grace of this film, if that’s the right way to put it, is that it journeys around the epidemiological trenches at this New York City hospital and brings back a variety of stories, some of them uplifting, and they thread into an effective narrative. There are patients who seem on the verge of death and struggle back, there are family members urging them along on those plastic-encased phones, and there are medical staffers whose trauma-filled work is getting the attention it deserves in our less troubled lives.</p>
<p>It sounds strange to say, but there is art in this film too. The way the camera lingers just long enough at the right moments and not too long at others, the way the lifted brow of a nurse speaks louder than words, the way the film breaks out of Long Island Jewish and moves into the streets of New York City, taking us from the gasps of Covid patients to the “I Can’t Breathe” chants of the Black Lives Matter movement — this is masterful work.</p>
<p>Heineman is no stranger to documentaries. He directed the Academy Award-nominated “Cartel Land,” about the drug trade on the U.S.-Mexico border. He also directed “City of Ghosts,” an award-winning film about citizen journalists in Raqqa, Syria. Those films demonstrated a willingness and ability to work in dangerous areas and gain the confidence of people who otherwise might not let an outsider into their worlds. Those talents are what went into the making of “The First Wave.”</p>
<p>Heineman used his experience and contacts to gain unparalleled access to Long Island Jewish. Across the U.S., hospitals were shutting their doors to journalists as the pandemic began. Only a handful gained entry, and their visits were short, usually just a few hours or a few days at most. Heineman’s team was at Long Island Jewish for months. Hospital administrators have cited safety and privacy concerns for keeping journalists out, but as Heineman’s experience showed, they could work inside Covid wards without getting in anyone’s way or spreading the virus.</p>

<p>That’s what makes the footage in his documentary so extraordinary. I worked for months on <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/11/13/covid-pandemic-hidden-toll-hospitals/">an investigative article</a> that delved into the way hospitals cracked down on reporters in the U.S., and I spent a lot of that time scouring through the imagery that was published by journalists, including filmmakers, and by medical staffers (some hospitals <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-31/hospitals-tell-doctors-they-ll-be-fired-if-they-talk-to-press">even</a> <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/05/09/coronavirus-nyc-nurse-hospital-hipaa/">threatened </a>doctors and nurses who shared photos or videos). I’ve seen nothing that comes close to Heineman’s graphic portrayal of Covid victims.</p>
<p>The only visual documentation of the pandemic that’s in the same league comes from far away. The director Hao Wu, working with Chinese journalists in early 2020, got relatively unfettered access to four hospitals in Wuhan, where the virus originated. His powerful documentary, “<a href="https://www.76daysfilm.com/watch">76 Days</a>,” came out last year and won an Emmy. Until the emergence of Heineman’s film, which opened Friday, Americans who wanted a visceral look inside a Covid ward had to watch a film shot in China.</p>
<p>It is hard to categorize “The First Wave” because it crosses boundaries: It is a documentary that also feels like a horror film, an exposé of social injustice, and a love letter. In its review of “The First Wave,” the Washington Post has a line that manages to be insightful and off-kilter at the same time. “The film feels like a viscerally effective time capsule from the recent past,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/the-first-wave-movie-review/2021/11/16/9b98d44c-44b4-11ec-a3aa-0255edc02eb7_story.html">wrote</a> Michael O’Sullivan, “yet one whose arrival in theaters may still be too soon for many.”</p>
<p>A time capsule is filled with the familiar objects of a civilization. But what’s in “The First Wave” is unfamiliar to most of us; we have not seen it before and perhaps have been unable to imagine it. There is the anguish of patients as they labor to breathe, the medical instruments warning of hearts no longer beating, the body bags zipped up and hauled away, and the moments of silence before nurses rush to the next room to try to save another life. Stumbling onto this time capsule, we are visitors from another world who are seeing for the first time what the Covid pandemic really meant.</p>
<p>This film has not come too soon. It has come too late.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>United Memorial Medical Center</u> is a small hospital in a working class part of Houston, with just over 100 beds and 40 doctors. Most of its patients lack health insurance, and a wrecking company is located opposite its main building, which has the look of a brutal mall from the 1970s.</p>
<p>Yet nearly every major U.S. news outlet — the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, NBC, CBS, and others — published stories or photos about United Memorial in the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic. One of the pandemic’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/11/30/covid-photo-varon/">iconic pictures</a> shows the hospital’s then-chief of staff, Dr. Joseph Varon, embracing an older patient. No other hospital came close to getting as much coverage in the early phase of the pandemic.</p>
<p>The reason is simple: Unlike virtually every other hospital in the country, United Memorial was opening its doors to journalists trying to document the suffering on the front lines of the pandemic. The photographer who shot the picture of Varon visited the hospital more than 20 times. Because journalists were being turned away elsewhere, they flocked to United Memorial.</p>
<p>“One of the things a hospital has to do, to provide care for an acute illness, is to educate the public,” Varon told The Intercept. “And the only way I can educate the public is through the media. I need the world to understand what is going on.”</p>

<p>An investigation by The Intercept reveals that in the first months of the pandemic, only a small number of the more than <a href="https://www.aha.org/statistics/fast-facts-us-hospitals">6,000 hospitals</a> in the U.S. let journalists inside — and when access was permitted, it was usually limited to a short time span. The upshot is that most hospitals, citing safety and privacy concerns, turned themselves into vaults that hid the strongest evidence of the virus’s lethality. Doors were shut so firmly that an award-winning documentarian even gave up on his effort to film in the U.S. and instead made his documentary about a country where he could get access to Covid patients: China.</p>
<p>When it began in the U.S., the pandemic was a mass casualty event with few pictures of the casualties.</p>
<p>Journalists who have covered wars and epidemics told The Intercept that the obstacles they encountered during the first waves of the pandemic were unparalleled in their careers. Isabeau Doucet, who reported on <a href="https://isabeaudoucet.org/tag/cholera/">cholera in Haiti</a>, was completely shut out. “I spent months trying and failing to get access to hospitals or even to get permission to interview doctors who I had spoken to off the record,” Doucet said. “The stonewalling from hospitals was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->
<p>Misha Friedman, who worked in public health before becoming an <a href="https://mishafriedman.com/about/">award-winning photojournalist</a>, was shocked at the obstruction in New York City. “I tried to go through doctors and nurses, I tried to go to the top, I even went to someone who was on the board [of a hospital], a billionaire, and he said, ‘I understand, but I don’t want to get involved,’” Friedman explained. Lucas Jackson, a photographer with Reuters, <a href="https://twitter.com/Lucas_Jackson_/status/1456370644115865600">noted recently</a> that he “worked for one of the biggest news companies in the world and couldn’t get access to a single hospital within 100 miles of NYC.”</p>
<p>One of the few photographers who had success early in the pandemic was Victor Blue, working for the New York Times. But Blue is deeply critical of what happened to other reporters. “NYC hospitals should be ashamed for keeping out journalists — I believe it worsened and prolonged the pandemic,” Blue <a href="https://twitter.com/victorjblue/status/1456486530680344594">wrote</a> on Twitter earlier this month, <a href="https://twitter.com/victorjblue/status/1456676696375980032">adding</a>, “I was frustrated and angry more hospitals weren’t opening up. &#8230; There was plenty of room for every outlet to get access.”</p>
<p>The experience of being shut out was not universal. Blue worked alongside Sheri Fink, who has a medical degree from Stanford University and embedded in an Ebola treatment unit in Liberia in 2014. Fink reported from inside a number of hospitals early in the pandemic and noted in an interview that the early months were truly the great unknown, with tremendous fears that hospitals could <i>spread </i>the virus. “In previous emerging outbreaks, hospitals have become points of amplification,” she noted. “They have become places where the disease explodes and spreads.”</p>
<p>The Times seems to have gotten more access than other news organizations in the first months of the pandemic, but even so, its front pages featured just a few images of people afflicted with Covid-19 in American hospitals. For the month of March, the newspaper had just <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/27/nytfrontpage/scannat.pdf">one front-page photo</a> of a patient in a U.S. hospital. The next month, the Times had only three front-page photos of patients inside U.S. hospitals, on <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/05/nytfrontpage/scannat.pdf">April 5</a>, <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/13/nytfrontpage/scannat.pdf">April 13</a>, and<a href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/26/nytfrontpage/scannat.pdf"> April 26</a>. There were a lot of photos in the Times and other outlets <em>about</em> Covid-19 — pictures of empty streets, of people wearing masks, of socially distanced lines, of exhausted doctors and nurses — but scant photos of anyone sick with the virus in a hospital, which is where virtually all acute cases could be found.</p>
<p>There are many reasons the U.S. Covid death toll has surpassed 750,000, beginning with dismissive rhetoric from the Trump administration that encouraged Americans to doubt the seriousness of the virus. But there is a less examined reason too: Hospitals hid the human devastation in the pandemic’s early days, when opinions and policies were indelibly shaped<em>.</em> The Covid-19 pandemic began as a mass censorship event.</p>

<h3>Heroes and Bureaucrats</h3>
<p>The work of medical staffs — nurses, doctors, custodians, and others — is rightly regarded as heroic. These workers saved innumerable lives, sometimes at the cost of their own. But hospital bureaucrats undercut those efforts by turning away journalists seeking irrefutable evidence that could reduce the skepticism in America. Hospital administrations even <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/05/09/coronavirus-nyc-nurse-hospital-hipaa/">investigated</a><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-31/hospitals-tell-doctors-they-ll-be-fired-if-they-talk-to-press"> staff members</a> who shared videos they had shot themselves.</p>
<p>Administrators who spoke with The Intercept or provided written statements emphasized that they limited access because of privacy and safety concerns as well as worries about medical staff being deluged. It’s certainly true that in the early months of the pandemic, everyone was overworked and exhausted, there was a shortage of personal protective equipment, and fears of spreading the virus led hospitals to close their doors even to the spouses and children of patients who were dying. Many final farewells had to be made using iPads.</p>
<p>“At the height of the pandemic, during March and April, we thought that embedding media in the hospital would be a distraction both to the hospital and to the staff,” said Steve Clark, a spokesperson for St. Barnabas Hospital in New York City. St. Barnabas is in the Bronx, a part of the city that was hit particularly hard by Covid-19. Clark described the hospital’s staff as overwhelmed in the first months of the pandemic and added, “We had a policy that we followed very closely that we didn’t let any media into the building.”</p>
<p>Even hospitals that opened their doors tended to do so sparingly. Houston Methodist Hospital, one of the largest hospitals in Texas, allowed a team from the Times to report from its Covid care units in the summer of 2020, when the state was going through the first of its Covid waves. But that was it — no other journalists were given access in those crucial months, not even from the local newspaper, according to Stefanie Asin, the hospital’s media relations director.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22left%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-left" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="left"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[3] -->&#8220;At the end of the day, hospitals are a corporation with a focus on the bottom line.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[3] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[3] -->
<p>“It would be poor practice to let a bunch of journalists into Covid wards, into waiting rooms, into cafeterias,” Asin said. There was a singular reason, she explained, for giving a green light to the Times: The writer was Fink, who had reported from the hospital in the aftermath of hurricane Harvey. “We didn’t want to bring in outside people who we didn’t know,” Asin said. “We didn’t allow spouses into the Covid units. We’re not going to let in a photographer.”</p>
<p>Decisions of this sort, occurring one by one at hospitals across the country, created a visual drought. Some of the fiercest criticism is now coming not just from journalists but also from medical staff who sought <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/plea-nation-doctors-fighting-covid-19-getmeppe">greater public awareness</a> of the harm caused by the virus as the pandemic got underway.</p>
<p>“There was no appetite to let anyone in,” said Dr. Craig Spencer, director of global health in emergency medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, speaking about hospitals in general. Spencer, who treated Ebola patients in Guinea in 2014 and contracted the disease himself, has been frank about his disdain for policies set by administrators. “My presumption is that they would assume it would only be embarrassing. There was no benefit to them showing the apocalypse and what it looked like. Having patients all over the emergency department on oxygen canisters and people intubated is not going to be a good image for your hospital. At the end of the day, hospitals are a corporation with a focus on the bottom line.”</p>

<h3>Power of Photography</h3>
<p>There is a long-running debate about the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/23/books/chapters/regarding-the-pain-of-others.html">impact of photography</a> — whether pictures or videos can really change public opinion and government policy. But in the early days of the pandemic, a short burst of graphic images of the dying and the dead had a concrete effect, leading President Donald Trump to take the virus more seriously. Unfortunately, instead of encouraging hospitals to allow more access, things went in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>The breakthrough occurred in late March, when freezer trucks were used in New York City to store corpses for whom there was no room inside hospital morgues. Pictures and video emerged of body bags being transferred to these freezer trucks, and some images showed rows of corpses inside the portable morgues. Trump, who had vowed to reopen the country from a brief lockdown, announced on March 29 that the lockdown would continue. He specifically cited the imagery coming out of New York.</p>
<p>“I’ve been watching that for the last week on television, body bags all over in hallways,” Trump <a href="https://abc7ny.com/coronavirus-nyc-new-york-city-elmhurst-hospital-queens/6061403/">said</a> in a Rose Garden press conference. “I have been watching them bring in trailer trucks, freezer trucks — they are freezer trucks because they can’t handle the bodies, there are so many of them. This is essentially in my community in Queens — Queens, New York. I have seen things I’ve never seen before. I mean, I’ve seen them, but I’ve seen them on television in faraway lands.” Trump added, “These are trucks that are as long as the Rose Garden, and they are pulling up to take out bodies, and you look inside, and you see the black body bags. You say, ‘What’s in there? It’s Elmhurst Hospital, must be supplies.’ It’s not supplies; it’s people.”</p>
<p>This was a pivotal moment: Trump was swayed not by his science advisers or elected officials but by pictures he saw on his television. If this had been constructed as an experiment — can graphic images change the mind of the most powerful Covid cynic in the country? — the hypothesis would have been proved. Yet hospitals reacted by tightening their crackdowns on anyone trying to get this kind of opinion-changing footage.</p>
<p>Some of the imagery that shocked Trump came from <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/03/30/disturbing-footage-shows-dead-bodies-loaded-onto-truck-outside-brooklyn-hospital/">Brooklyn Hospital Center</a>. In late March, photographer Braulio Jatar shot a particularly chilling picture of a body wrapped in sheets as it was <a href="https://twitter.com/brauliojatarm/status/1244734177561448451">carried by a forklift</a> onto a freezer truck outside the hospital. But when Jatar returned to the hospital in April, a fence had been built to keep the bodies out of view. This was happening at other hospitals too. The president and the rest of the country would not be discomforted by further publication of disturbing imagery.</p>
<p>“It was a tough time emotionally,” said Lenny Singletary, Brooklyn Hospital’s senior vice president of external affairs. “My feelings at the time were a bit of frustration: &#8216;Wow, have some dignity for the loved ones.’ &#8230; We didn’t want people taking photos of bodies being transported.”</p>

<p>Singletary’s reaction is understandable. In ordinary times, it would be ghoulish to facilitate photography of body bags. In ordinary times, the sheer numbers of corpses, the statistics on their own, would be proof enough. But these were not ordinary times. “The numbers have become a concrete wall,” <a href="https://academic.oup.com/dh/article/45/3/489/6311888">noted</a> historian Mary Dudziak. “Covid-19 tables and graphs both reveal and conceal. They are intended to illuminate, but turning casualties into numbers accomplishes an erasure of the dead themselves.”</p>
<p>For some Americans, erasure was preferable. A telling example came as Los Angeles was going through its worst days of the pandemic in 2020. A Washington Post reporter, Scott Wilson, visited a mortuary and posted pictures of bodies wrapped in white cloths on Twitter. By the end of the day, he deleted <a href="https://twitter.com/PostScottWilson/status/1349186942676520960">his post</a> due to complaints from other accounts on the social media site.</p>
<p>“Mass death is ugly,” Wilson <a href="https://twitter.com/PostScottWilson/status/1349186942676520960">wrote</a>. “But I’ll self-censor.”</p>
<p>And it wasn’t just hospitals or social media that sanitized what the public would see as the pandemic got underway. When photographer George Steinmetz flew a drone over a mass grave on New York City&#8217;s Hart Island, officers from the city’s police department <a href="https://pressfreedomtracker.us/all-incidents/police-seize-drone-photojournalist-documents-mass-graves-new-york/">charged him</a> with a misdemeanor and confiscated his equipment. Though the charge was later dropped, the incident was another manifestation of the barriers that prevented Americans from seeing the pandemic’s true toll.</p>
<p>“If people had seen the reality of what it was like, they would have been more likely to follow social distancing and all the things we were recommending as public health measures,” said Spencer, the Columbia University doctor. “I think that if people were to have a better understanding of what it looks like for hospitals that are completely overwhelmed and struggling, what it looks like to be intubated — if people were able to see the apocalyptic conditions inside hospitals, I think it would change how willing people are to adhere to public health guidelines.”</p>

<h3>War Hospitals</h3>
<p>Whether in a pandemic, hurricane, or war, hospitals function as calamity’s mirror. I saw this during the siege of Sarajevo in the 1990s.</p>
<p>The Bosnian capital was surrounded by Serb troops who bombed and strafed the city, killing and wounding civilians by the thousands. Sometimes a journalist would be present when a mortar exploded at a marketplace or a sniper’s bullet hit its mark — one day I happened <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1993/03/11/in-sarajevo-terror-in-the-crosshairs/e00a7809-d70a-48f9-8137-45ec1d51784e/">to see a man get shot</a> and try to crawl to safety — but much of the time we caught up with the wounded at Kosevo Hospital, which would <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1993/03/10/noon-visiting-hours-prove-deadly-as-serbs-target-sarajevo-hospital/27c81bdd-1866-4f83-bf05-748e28866c7e/">often get bombed</a> too. There were no restrictions; you could talk to any doctors or patients who were willing to speak.</p>
<p>The war’s tragic face was revealed at this hospital. After all, how could you understand a war, how could you feel in your gut its darkness, how could you convey this to the rest of the world, without seeing the wounded and the dead and knowing their stories? How can anyone understand a calamity without seeing its victims? To be shut out of Sarajevo’s hospital would have meant being shut out of one of the most important battlegrounds of the war.</p>

<p>I cannot remember a doctor or patient declining to talk. They wanted the rest of the world to know the war’s brutality and inhumanity. Stories and images of victims are inherently powerful; casualties are evidence. The less evidence we see, the less we might believe or be aware of the disaster. That’s why, for instance, the U.S. military tries to prevent photographers from taking pictures of injured or killed soldiers. For nearly two decades, the Pentagon even banned journalists from covering the transfer of military coffins at Dover Air Force Base.</p>
<p>It is dark outside as I write these words, and I wonder why hospital photography has taken such a hold on me. There is an answer. I have spent much of my life writing about the dying and the dead, not in pandemics but in war, and on one occasion I got some photographic evidence that was scant at the time, and it was stolen from me. This was in 2005, when I got on a U.S. military flight in Baghdad that was heading for Kuwait. Before boarding, I was asked by a soldier whether I was willing to travel with “HR.” I didn’t know that military acronym, so I asked what it meant. Human remains, he said, not looking up.</p>
<p>The plane was a C-17, and it carried a dozen flag-draped coffins that were made of a shiny metal. The flight lasted for what seemed like hours. My knees were inches from a coffin. At the Kuwait military airport, an honor guard removed the caskets with aching respect. It was nighttime, so I held my camera at chest level, turned off the flash to attract minimal attention, and shot a set of photos. This was against the rules: Photos of coffins were still forbidden. After the last coffin was removed, the passengers, mostly soldiers and contractors, filed out of the back of the plane and onto a bus.</p>
<p>As the doors of the bus were about to close, a military police officer jumped on board.</p>
<p>“Someone was taking pictures,” he announced. “Who was it?”</p>
<p>I stayed quiet as a soldier raised her hand. The MP deleted her photos and left. But a few seconds later, the MP returned and asked, standing at the front of the bus, “Who else was taking pictures?”</p>
<p>I was traveling with a photographer, Gilles Peress, and didn’t want to jeopardize the photos he had taken during our work together in Iraq. The MP might confiscate his film. So I raised my hand, and the MP walked down the aisle to me. As he deleted my photos, he said he had the same camera and he really liked it. He smiled as he handed it back to me. My photos of the dead were gone.</p>

<h3>Pandemic Economics</h3>
<p>When there is a hurricane, flood, or wildfire, the damage is not hidden. In those emergencies, there are few restrictions on what journalists and the public can see — the snapped trees, submerged streets, bodies floating in water, houses in flames. But the worst destruction of Covid-19 is not on display in places where journalists can bear witness as they wish. Most of the sick, dying, and dead are in medical facilities whose economic interests are best served by keeping journalists away. That’s how you get a cataclysm without the visuals of cataclysm.</p>
<p>U.S. hospitals are a mix of for-profit and not-for-profit entities, though all must focus on the bottom line, some more fiercely than others. Their executives often earn salaries on an exorbitant par with the rest of corporate America. At Mass General Brigham, a not-for-profit hospital system in Massachusetts, 17 executives <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/08/18/business/here-are-16-honchos-who-made-more-than-1-million-mass-general-brigham-2018/">earned more than $1 million</a> in 2018; the chief executive earned about $4 million that year. One of the system’s main hospitals, Massachusetts General, told The Intercept <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/12/27/covid-photography-hospitals/">in a statement</a> last year that it did not allow photographers inside “for the privacy of our patients and also for their safety and that of our staff.”</p>
<p>The economics concept of “positive externalities” may help explain, in addition to safety and privacy concerns, why hospitals supposedly devoted to saving lives would refuse to allow journalists inside their walls during a pandemic. “Positive externalities” describe a situation in which the benefits of a company&#8217;s activity do not accrue entirely to the company paying for it. If the activity is costly to perform, the company will do less of it than society would like.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(promote-promo)[11](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_PROMO%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22align%22%3Anull%2C%22crop%22%3A%22promo%22%2C%22promo%22%3A%22the-coronavirus-crisis%22%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-promo="the-coronavirus-crisis" data-crop="promo" data-align=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-promo)[11] -->
<p>That might sound confusing, but here’s an example: When a hospital grants access to a journalist, the abundant upside of its action — public awareness of the danger of Covid-19 — would be spread across society rather than concentrated in the hospital. In doing so, however, the hospital may face a variety of potential costs, such as the publication of off-brand photos of chaos in its wards, a malpractice suit if a journalist sees something go awry, a privacy lawsuit if a patient’s identity is disclosed without permission, or the liability of a journalist contracting Covid-19.</p>
<p>“It’s a private cost and a public benefit,” said Ashvin Gandhi, an assistant professor at UCLA Anderson School of Management. Gandhi, who researches the health care industry, noted that “the more an activity helps third parties, the more of it that society as a whole wants to be done.&#8221; But that doesn&#8217;t change the core problem. The company performing the activity — let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s letting journalists into a Covid ward — doesn&#8217;t derive enough benefits to justify doing more of it. As a result, Gandhi added, “the larger a positive externality, the greater underprovision there will be.”</p>
<p>That raises a question about the relatively few hospitals that opened their doors a crack in the early days of the pandemic: Why did they?</p>

<p>Brooklyn Hospital, although it erected a fence to shield the transfer of body bags, did allow two teams of journalists inside in March 2020. Singletary, the hospital’s head of external affairs, played a key role. He was a newcomer to the health care industry, joining the hospital in 2018 after a career on Wall Street, and when the moment came to decide on giving access to journalists, “I was naive enough to take the risk,” he told The Intercept.</p>
<p>One consideration, he said, was that his hospital is a minor player in the industry: It’s a community facility that’s not affiliated with a large chain, and most of its patients do not have health insurance. Unlike the major medical centers everyone has heard about in New York — Mount Sinai, NYU Langone, NewYork-Presbyterian — Brooklyn Hospital has a hard time getting attention and is not drenched in donations from billionaires. Singletary said that as the pandemic began, a hospital trustee told him it could be an opportunity for good publicity.</p>
<p>“The statement was that it would be a shame if we wasted this crisis,” Singletary said. “In order for us to get a little place like ours the attention it so deserved, we had to do something a little bit different.”</p>
<p>Singletary said he asked his staff to contact the New York Times and he personally facilitated the visit of the newspaper&#8217;s journalists. After their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/nyregion/coronavirus-brooklyn-hospital.html">first story</a> was published, the hospital was inundated with requests from other media outlets. Singletary allowed one more team inside — a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-nyc-brooklyn-hospital-center-patients/">crew from CBS</a> — but refused all others.</p>

<h3>New York to Wuhan</h3>
<p>When the U.S. death toll reached 500,000 early this year, the New Yorker <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/the-awful-uncertainty-of-the-coronavirus-death-toll">published a story</a> about the milestone, using a photo that showed a crematorium worker amid stacks of coffins. But these were not U.S. victims — they were Italians. The photo was shot in Italy in 2020.</p>
<p>It has not been unusual for U.S. publications to use pictures from other countries to illustrate the human toll of the pandemic. When the New York Times published a “Year in Pictures” portfolio for 2020, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/year-in-pictures.html#march">main photo for March</a> was from Bergamo, the epicenter of Italy’s outbreak. The photo, which shows medical workers around a Covid patient at his home, was shot by Fabio Bucciarelli and is one of the strongest images to emerge from the pandemic’s early phase. The picture’s intimacy stemmed from Bucciarelli gaining <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/27/world/europe/coronavirus-italy-bergamo.html">close access</a> to Covid patients, access that most U.S. photographers could only dream of.</p>
<p>“It was very frustrating to see in March that all of the great stuff was coming from Italy,” noted Friedman, the photographer who was turned down across New York City. “They understood and were giving people more access.”</p>

<p>The saga of documentarian Hao Wu is instructive. Born and raised in China, Wu has lived in the United States for nearly 30 years, and in 2018 he directed the award-winning documentary “People’s Republic of Desire.” When the pandemic began, he wanted to make a documentary about Wuhan, the Chinese city where the pandemic originated, and New York City, where he lives. But he had no luck getting access to hospitals in New York, so he focused his attention on Wuhan, where it turned out that for a brief window of time, some Chinese journalists were able to get inside Covid wards.</p>
<p>Wu worked with journalists who gained access to four Wuhan hospitals in the early days of its lockdown. At the time, things were incredibly chaotic, and the central government in Beijing hadn’t yet issued guidelines for media access, Wu told The Intercept. Individual hospitals could decide on their own whether to let journalists inside, though this would change later on as Beijing took more control. At the lockdown’s outset, the journalists who collaborated with Wu were able to work with relative freedom, and their footage included a terrifying scene in which sick people banged on a hospital’s locked door to get inside for treatment. Wu turned the footage into the Emmy Award-winning “<a href="https://tiff.net/events/76-days">76 Days</a>,” a reference to the length of Wuhan’s lockdown.</p>
<p>This is one of the most stunning facets of the pandemic’s opening stages: America’s hospital industry may have been even more effective in censoring the media than China’s government. A one-party state that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/14/business/wuhan-coronavirus-journalists.html">detained</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/05/chinese-journalist-jailed-over-covid-reporting-is-close-to-death-family-say">imprisoned</a> citizen journalists for criticizing the government’s handling of the pandemic, China nonetheless had a brief window when its journalists could carve out more freedom to work inside hospitals than their American counterparts.</p>

<h3>A Long Island Exception</h3>
<p>What did it take to maneuver around the roadblocks in America?</p>
<p>Matthew Heineman is one of the most prominent documentarians in the U.S., and when the pandemic broke out, he wanted to get inside a hospital. His 2015 film about the drug trade, “Cartel Land,” had won a slew of awards. In 2017, he directed another award-winning documentary, “City of Ghosts,” about citizen journalists in Raqqa, Syria. But it was an earlier and lesser-known film, “Escape Fire,” that gave him the key he needed to get where he wanted to go.</p>
<p>“Escape Fire” was about the American health care system, and one of the authorities it featured was Dr. Donald Berwick, who headed the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services during the Obama administration. As the Covid-19 pandemic began, Berwick vouched for Heineman with Michael Dowling, the chief executive of Northwell Health, the largest health care provider in New York state. Dowling supported Heineman’s effort to make a Covid-19 documentary and connected him with Michael Goldberg, the executive director of one of Northwell’s flagship hospitals, Long Island Jewish Medical Center.</p>
<p>With the backing of Northwell’s top administrators, Heineman got to work — but he still had a ways to go. The initial agreement was that he would not film any patients. This is one of the barriers that journalists who have been fortunate enough to get inside a U.S. hospital usually run into. Because of the federal privacy law known as HIPAA, hospitals are concerned about fines from the government or lawsuits from patients if journalists disclose the identities of patients without approval. However, there have been just two cases in the past decade in which media organizations were found by the government to have breached patient privacy — and each case, in<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/nyregion/dying-in-the-er-and-on-tv-without-his-familys-consent.html"> 2011</a> and<a href="https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/2018/10/02/abc-film-crews-leave-hospitals-on-the-hook-for-hipaa-fines/"> 2014</a>, involved reality TV teams, not journalists.</p>
<p>“Wherever you are in the world, it’s important to get buy-in from the top, and then generally once that happens, it smooths the path below,” Heineman told The Intercept. “We gained access with the leadership team [of Northwell Health], and then the individual leadership team at Long Island Jewish, and then the doctors and patients.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[16](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[16] -->&#8220;If people truly saw what was happening, the overall narrative and dialogue about this pandemic would have been different. Everyone was clapping at 7 o’clock, but they didn’t really know what they were clapping for.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[16] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[16] -->
<p>About 18 months later, the result of Heineman’s efforts is a 93-minute documentary that is being released on November 19 and is truly breathtaking, with emotional scenes not just of doctors and nurses performing their front-line work but also the patients they were trying to save — and those they were unable to save. “<a href="https://films.nationalgeographic.com/the-first-wave">The First Wave</a>” contains some of the most explicit scenes that have been filmed in U.S. hospitals: There are shots of patients being intubated, of others dying as staff administer CPR, and of bodies being zipped into bags. The film also has an expertly layered narrative that is already being hailed, in <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/reviews/the-first-wave-review-1235081044/">advance reviews</a>, as a masterpiece.</p>
<p>Heineman feels that on a certain level, his film might be too little, too late. While he was inside the hospital, he was in touch with colleagues who were also trying to document the pandemic but were not able to get access to other medical centers. “I think one of the greatest tragedies of Covid is the fact that the general public did not see what was happening,” he said. “An already divided nation was further divided by misinformation and lack of clarity and real visual images.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible to know whether more reporting in the early days would have made a significant difference; that is the realm of the counterfactual. Fink isn&#8217;t sure it would have mattered. <span style="font-weight: 400">“I was very motivated early on by the thought that this could help people to understand the reality, help inform their decision-making, keep them safe, and contribute to saving lives,” she said. “But I don’t know. As I reported on surge after surge in hospitals overwhelmed in various places, I started to wonder whether or not I was right about the impact.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She doesn’t doubt the importance of what journalists were doing and would have liked to see more of it, but after 18 months and the accumulation of a considerable amount of information on the virus, there are still lots of people who refuse to be swayed by evidence. “There are literally people who are in hospitals now with Covid or who have family members in hospital with Covid who still feel exactly as they did about not trusting vaccines, not believing in the utility of masks,” Fink said. “So people have the data, and they are making different choices. They have different beliefs. I am not sure that more images of hospitals, more reporting out of hospitals, would change that.”</span></p>
<p>Heineman has a different view. &#8220;Stats and headlines can only do so much,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If people truly saw what was happening, the overall narrative and dialogue about this pandemic would have been different. Everyone was clapping at 7 o’clock, but they didn’t really know what they were clapping for.”</p>

<h3></h3>
<h3>Industrial Censorship</h3>
<p>Censorship operates in ways that are far more complicated than a government getting between journalists and a story, though that’s one element of what happened in America.</p>
<p>As The Intercept <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/12/27/covid-photography-hospitals/">previously reported</a>, the Trump administration contributed to the suppression of Covid journalism by tightening HIPAA guidelines on media access to health care facilities. In May 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees HIPAA, reinforced a set of restrictions on hospitals letting journalists inside. However, the fact that some journalists got access to United Memorial and other facilities shows that a willing hospital could open its doors.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[18](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A1%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="1"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[18] -->
<p>In other words, the White House’s instructions were not ironclad. This was less a matter of state censorship and more a matter of industrial censorship. When you step back, it’s truly remarkable that in an era of hypersurveillance, with cameras in everyone’s phones, with billions of images and videos created and shared every day, there was so little to be seen of the virus’s victims in the first months of the pandemic. In many ways, it is easier to find <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2018/04/photos-the-1918-flu-pandemic/557663/">pictures of Americans</a> suffering from the 1918 flu pandemic than from Covid a century later.</p>
<p>United Memorial’s defiance of the tide is explained by a single, illuminating factor. It is a small hospital and was pretty much ruled by one person last year — Varon. He was the chief of staff, chief of critical care, and chair of its board (though he recently stepped down from those positions and is now chief of Covid-19 and critical care). Varon is a confidence-filled maverick who does not mind the attention of the media or the disapproval of his peers. This year, for instance, he took another unconventional path by prescribing the human version of the drug ivermectin to some of his patients, in concert with treatments the Food and Drug Administration has approved for Covid-19. Last year, when he began bringing journalists inside the hospital, United Memorial’s general counsel “wasn’t too happy,” Varon recalled, but he bulldozed ahead.</p>
<p>Varon has spent a lifetime making diagnoses, and he has one for his profession in an era of pandemics. “The problem is that big hospitals are run by lawyers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They are not run by doctors.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Afghanistan was supposed to be the “good war” after 9/11, the one with a legitimate purpose and a happy ending. That also didn’t turn out to be true, but while the war’s momentum favored the Taliban for years, its final act had the suddenness of a guillotine, with a lot more pain. At Kabul’s airport, desperate Afghans clung to the sides of a departing U.S. cargo plane. Panicked families tried to get onto the diminishing number of evacuation flights. And 13 U.S. troops helping keep the airport open were killed in a suicide bombing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Just before midnight on August 30, the last U.S. aircraft and the last U.S. soldier got out of Kabul.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This defeat could have been an opportunity to rethink the logic of America’s war machine. That’s what defeats often do: They force you to reconsider the destructive tendencies that got you into the hole. One of those tendencies has been a nearly ceaseless rise in military spending that has little popular support. Even before the fall of Kabul, opinion </span><a href="https://egfound.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/EGF-WorldsApart-2019.pdf">polls</a> consistently showed that only a minority of Americans think that<span style="font-weight: 400"> the U.S. should spend more on its defense &#8212; just 26 percent in a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1666/military-national-defense.aspx">survey conducted by Gallup</a> in February. And o</span><span style="font-weight: 400">n the day that the U.S. got out of Afghanistan, Rep.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Guess what happened?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To understand the next step, you need to go back to April, when President Joe Biden proposed a</span> <a href="https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2021/4/9/breaking-biden-proposes-715-billion-pentagon-budget-for-2022"><span style="font-weight: 400">$715 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> Pentagon budget for 2022, which represented a 1.6 percent increase from 2021.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the legislative prelude to Lee’s call for new priorities. Two days later, on September 2, the House Armed Services Committee met to consider the military budget, and as expected, an amendment was introduced by the ranking Republican to match the Senate increase. This set off a debate in which one of the strongest backers of the plus-up was a Democrat, Rep. Elaine Luria, a former Navy officer whose Virginia district includes the naval station in Norfolk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In one word, we can sum up the ‘why,’ and that’s China,” Luria said. “We are ending our longest conflict of 20 years, but more than ever, the world is watching what we do here today. … Right now there are malign actors who seek to attack us and do us harm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This has been a reliable power move over the decades: When one threat fades away, another seems to come along at just the right time.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, the committee voted 42-17 to increase the budget, with 14 Democrats </span><a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/09/03/democrats-defense-industry-military-budget/"><span style="font-weight: 400">joining</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> 28 Republicans.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s as if we have learned nothing from the past 20 years,” said Rep. Sara Jacobs, a Democrat from California, during the debate. She noted that rather than pumping money into the military, more resources could go toward diplomacy, education, infrastructure, and public health. “That is what will determine if we are competitive with China, not whether we have one more F-35 that even the Pentagon says they don’t need,” she concluded.</span></p>
<p>The fundamental idea behind her argument was evoked during the Vietnam War by Martin Luther King Jr., who warned in 1967: “A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.”</p>

<h3>A Beverly Hills Mansion</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you want to understand the soul-killing trajectory of U.S. military spending, you should look at a recent home purchase in Beverly Hills, California.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Last month, a wealthy buyer paid $20.9 million for a mansion with 8,600 square feet of living space that includes five bedrooms, seven bathrooms, and an interior courtyard with an olive tree. The buyer’s name, according to a</span> <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/son-afghanistan-former-defense-minister-172358560.html"><span style="font-weight: 400">news article</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400">that was widely shared on social media, is Daoud Wardak. Little is known about Wardak except that his father was a defense minister in Afghanistan and his older brother founded an obscure logistics company that landed</span> <a href="https://www.typeinvestigations.org/investigation/2009/11/30/us-funds-taliban/"><span style="font-weight: 400">more than a quarter billion dollars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in U.S. military contracts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not clear how Wardak was able to purchase his new residence or the $5.2 million condo he also owns in Miami Beach, Florida. But what’s known is that</span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/study-says-nearly-half-of-defense-spending-for-9-11-wars-went-to-private-contractors"> <span style="font-weight: 400">nearly half</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of U.S. military expenditures since 9/11 — the total is about $14 trillion — have gone to contractors. Some are global brands of lethality, such as Raytheon and General Dynamics, while others are pop-up entities with headquarters that are post office boxes. The money that has vanished through corruption is legendary as well as unknowable, because the Pentagon has</span> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/19/997961646/the-pentagon-has-never-passed-an-audit-some-senators-want-to-change-that"><span style="font-weight: 400">never passed an audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, and until recently, it didn’t even try to conduct one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s a scenario of national deformation that was predicted in 1961 by President Dwight Eisenhower, who warned in his farewell address of the rise of a</span> <a href="https://www.eisenhowerlibrary.gov/sites/default/files/all-about-ike/speeches/wav-files/farewell-address.mp3"><span style="font-weight: 400">military-industrial complex</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. The numbers behind this deformation are stunning. Since 2001, the five largest weapons manufacturers in the U.S. have</span> <a href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2021/09/02/top-defense-firms-see-2t-return-on-1b-investment-in-afghan-war/"><span style="font-weight: 400">spent more than $1.1 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> lobbying the government — and that statistic doesn’t even include their donations to candidates, their funding of think tanks, or their payments to generals who become board members. These investments have paid off, according to Stephen Semler of</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">the</span> <a href="https://stephensemler.substack.com/p/the-top-5-military-contractors-ate"><span style="font-weight: 400">Security Policy Reform Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, which calculates that those five firms have received more than $2 trillion in government contracts since 2001.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then there is the revolving door. Biden chose as his defense secretary a board member of Raytheon — retired Gen. Lloyd Austin, who received a payout of up to $1.7 million when he left the company. Austin was also a member of defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton&#8217;s national security advisory board, for which he was paid $200,000 in the year before he became defense secretary. The revolving door was operational during the Trump administration too: President Donald Trump’s last confirmed defense secretary, Mark Esper, was a</span> <a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/mark-esper-raytheon-weapons-lobbyist/"><span style="font-weight: 400">senior lobbyist for Raytheon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> before joining the Cabinet; the company paid him more than $1.5 million in his final year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The door continues to spin. Just last month, the Pentagon’s head of foreign military sales, Heidi Grant, left her government job and a day later started</span> <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/digital-show-dailies/ausa/2021/10/13/pentagons-arms-sales-chief-resigns-as-biden-administration-faces-decisions-on-transfer-policy/"><span style="font-weight: 400">her new one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> as Boeing’s vice president for business development. The closeness of the industry and the government, to the point of being indistinguishable at times, was even referenced in a </span><a href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2021/10/27/weapons-execs-lament-losses-from-afghanistan-exit-tout-dod-budget-increase/">conference call</a> last month between investors and the chief executive of Raytheon, one of the largest weapons producers in the U.S.</p>
<p>“Defense spending is nonpartisan,” noted Gregory Hayes, the Raytheon CEO whose compensation <a href="https://www.journalinquirer.com/business/raytheon-ceo-made-21m-despite-pay-cut/article_4cdd5ca8-8658-11eb-82e3-f3bd7633e6b2.html">exceeded $20 million</a> last year. “We’re encouraged to see Congress supporting plus-ups to the president’s budget that are also aligned to our business and our investments.”</p>

<h3>America Against the World</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is a story about a reckoning that gets mugged every time it ventures into daylight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A year ago, a group of House Democrats led by Lee and Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., banded together to support an amendment to cut U.S. military spending by 10 percent. There were only 96 of them, so their amendment didn’t come close to passing, but it was the start of what progressives knew would be an incremental effort to narrow the distance between military spending and common sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Things seemed to look better this year.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The upstarts had</span> <a href="https://lee.house.gov/news/press-releases/reps-lee-pocan-announce-defense-spending-reduction-caucus"><span style="font-weight: 400">created</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the Defense Spending Reduction Caucus and</span> <a href="https://pocan.house.gov/sites/pocan.house.gov/files/documents/Biden%20Defense%20Cuts%20Letter_Final.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">sent a letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to Biden in March to remind him that if the Pentagon’s budget was cut by 10 percent, it would still be larger than the next 10 largest militaries combined (and most of those are U.S. allies). They argued that a clear lesson could be learned from the war on terror, which not only cost trillions of dollars, but also took the lives of more than</span> <a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/human/military/killed"><span style="font-weight: 400">7,000 U.S. soldiers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and at least</span> <a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/human/civilians"><span style="font-weight: 400">hundreds of thousands</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of Iraqi and Afghan civilians. “The premise of a military-centric foreign policy is a failure,” their letter stated, well before the fall of Kabul.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On September 22, the $740 billion budget, which had been approved by the Armed Services Committee, arrived for a vote on the House floor, where there was a short debate on the amendment to reduce it by 10 percent. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., cited China and warned of “catastrophic effects on our training and readiness” if there were any cuts. His remark drew a sharp response from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who said it wasn’t the military’s readiness that was threatened but “the profit margins of defense contractors.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The amendment got only</span> <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2021/09/23/house-nears-vote-on-final-passage-of-defense-policy-bill/"><span style="font-weight: 400">86 votes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, all from Democrats, which was fewer than the 93 votes it got a year earlier, before the humiliation in Afghanistan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were several reasons it fared worse, including the fact that this year the Pentagon budget came from a Democratic rather than Republican administration; some Democrats were willing to reduce the budget only if the other party was asking for an increase. Additionally, an amendment was offered this year to cut just the $25 billion plus-up, and this less radical proposal got</span> <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2021285?Page=1"><span style="font-weight: 400">142</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> votes, which wasn’t enough to pass but was more than the budget-reducing amendment got. It appears to have functioned as an easy way for Democrats to signal their slight concern about military spending without going against their president or seeking a true reduction.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The House approved the $740 billion budget with strong</span> <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2021/09/23/plans-for-bigger-defense-budget-get-boost-after-house-authorization-bill-vote/"><span style="font-weight: 400">support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> from both parties. The budget is now in the hands of the full Senate, which is expected to vote on it soon. Despite the failure in Afghanistan, there seems little likelihood that U.S. military spending will slow down.</span></p>

<p><u>Colin Powell is</u> being hailed, at his death, as a trailblazer. He certainly was that.</p>
<p>Raised in the South Bronx by immigrant parents, Powell was a graduate of the City College of New York and rose through the ranks of the U.S. military to become the first Black chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, under President George H.W. Bush during the Persian Gulf War. After that — and most famously — he served as America’s first Black secretary of state during the presidency of George W. Bush. He died today at 84 of complications related to Covid-19.</p>

<p>His contemporaries in the U.S. cannot find enough words of praise. “Colin Powell was the North Star to a generation of senior American military officers including me,” <a href="https://twitter.com/stavridisj/status/1450080725982748673">wrote</a> retired Adm. James Stavridis. For <a href="https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/1450148186958487552">Richard Haass</a>, who heads the Council on Foreign Relations, Powell was “the most intellectually honest person I ever met.”</p>
<p>It’s a different story in Iraq, where millions of people likely share the sentiments of Muntadher Alzaidi, who memorably <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4rYWc4o-eY">threw his shoes</a> at George W. Bush during a 2008 press conference in Baghdad. Reacting to Powell’s death, Alzaidi expressed sadness only over the fact that he did not face a war crimes trial for his pivotal role in the invasion of Iraq. “I am sure that the court of God will be waiting for him,” Alzaidi <a href="https://twitter.com/muntazer_zaidi/status/1450076978627977220">wrote</a> on Twitter.</p>

<p>Powell’s friends in America tend to briefly note, in the soft glaze of his own regret, the most consequential act of his life. On February 5, 2003, Powell made a <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4716794/user-clip-colin-powells-speech">76-minute speech</a> to the United Nations Security Council in which he argued the Bush administration’s case for invading Iraq. He insisted that Iraq’s leader, Saddam Hussein, was overseeing a secret program to make weapons of mass destruction. Powell brandished satellite photos of what he confidently said were decontamination trucks, aluminum tubes, and other WMD paraphernalia. He even held up a vial that he said could contain anthrax.</p>
<p>There was, of course, a big problem with all of his assertions: <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2018/02/06/lie-after-lie-what-colin-powell-knew-about-iraq-fifteen-years-ago-and-what-he-told-the-un/">They were lies</a>. The intelligence behind his speech was the opposite of emphatic — it was false, manipulated, and fabricated. The trucks were just trucks. The tubes were just tubes. There was no anthrax. There was, more fundamentally, no reason to invade Iraq. Nonetheless, thanks to Powell’s presentation, the Bush administration went ahead with its plans, and in the ensuing catastrophe, at least <a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/human/civilians/iraqi">several hundred thousand Iraqis</a> lost their lives, as well as more than 4,000 U.S. soldiers.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of senior officials in the Bush era who had a higher quotient of intentional malignance than Powell. We know their names well: Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Condoleezza Rice, George Tenet, Paul Wolfowitz, and, of course, Bush himself. But Powell was unique in a way that does not flatter his legacy: He was perhaps the only public figure who could have stopped the White House from going ahead with its lunatic invasion, and he failed to do so. In a lengthy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/magazine/colin-powell-iraq-war.html">article</a> published last year, writer Robert Draper traced the what-if of Powell, the most popular member of Bush’s post-9/11 Cabinet, telling the truth when it mattered:</p>
<blockquote><p>What if that same voice that publicly proclaimed the necessity of invading Iraq had instead told Bush privately that it was not merely an invitation to unintended consequences but a mistake, as he personally believed it to be? What if he said no to Bush when he asked him to speak before the U.N.? Powell would almost certainly have been obligated to resign, and many if not all of his top staff members involved in the Iraq issue would also have quit.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dominoes would have continued to fall. The British foreign secretary, Jack Straw, would have almost certainly followed Powell’s example, which meant that the crucial British support for the invasion would have cratered. In the U.S., Draper noted, “Doubters in the upper ranks of the American military — there were several — would have been empowered to speak out; intelligence would have been reexamined; Democrats, now liberated from the political pressures of the midterm election, would most likely have joined the chorus.”</p>
<p>That was the path not taken, because Powell would not stand up to Bush.</p>
<p>“I didn’t have any choice,” Powell told Draper feebly. “What choice did I have? He’s the president.”</p>
<p>The ironic twist of not just Powell’s career but also the careers of so many American generals is that they abjectly lacked, when the moment called for it, the one thing that soldiers are supposed to possess in abundance: courage. The history of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is filled with <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/09/08/afghanistan-iraq-generals-soldiers-disciplined-911/">U.S. generals who were lauded as heroes</a> but lacked the guts or honesty to stand up to the whims and dictates of their superiors. Millions of people have been killed and injured on their failed watch since 9/11.</p>

<p>Powell resigned from the Bush administration in 2004 and never really owned up to what he had done. He recognized that his U.N. speech was inaccurate and described it, in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/09/politics/powell-calls-his-un-speech-a-lasting-blot-on-his-record.html">interview</a> with celebrity journalist Barbara Walters, as “painful” and a “blot” on his career. Those comments, not long after he left office, were pretty much as far as he would ever go in terms of introspection or criticism. He was unable to admit the truth that his chief of staff Lawrence Wilkerson now acknowledges. “I participated in a hoax on the American people, the international community, and the United Nations Security Council,” Wilkerson has <a href="http://www.shoppbs.pbs.org/now/shows/315/whistleblowers.html">said</a>.</p>
<p>The “blot” did not matter that much to Powell’s reputation in the U.S., because after the Iraq disaster, he continued to blaze a lucrative path in the corporate world, joining the board of directors of <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/company/leadership/bios/bio-powell/">Salesforce</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomenergy.com/news/bloom-energy-issues-statement-on-the-passing-of-gen-colin-powell/">Bloom Energy</a> and becoming a “strategic adviser” to the venture capital firm <a href="https://www.kleinerperkins.com/people/colin-powell/">Kleiner Perkins</a>. (He was already very rich — he had received a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/colin-powell-fortune-includes-legacy-191929575.html">$6 million advance</a> for his 1995 memoir “My American Journey.”) He was a trailblazer, in this way, for a generation of retired generals who have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/09/04/mcchrystal-afghanistan-navistar-consulting-generals/">coasted into 1 percent status</a> thanks to the flattering reviews they receive in cultural and political circles no matter the actual consequences of their government service.</p>
<p>In fact, there are many levels on which Powell can be described as trailblazing, and it’s complicated to consider them together. As reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/Russian_Starr/status/1450123233525649412">Terrell Jermaine Starr</a> and columnist <a href="https://twitter.com/KarenAttiah/status/1450111648438566912">Karen Attiah</a> noted within hours of Powell’s passing, he was an important and inspiring figure to a large number of Black Americans, particularly before his service in the Bush administration. “I am genuinely sad about Colin Powell’s death — while acknowledging his role in America’s reckless decision to invade Iraq,” Attiah <a href="https://twitter.com/KarenAttiah/status/1450111648438566912">wrote</a> on Twitter.</p>
<p>Scholar and journalist Marc Lamont Hill struck a similar balance in his assessment today. “At the personal level, Colin Powell was a nice man,” <a href="https://twitter.com/marclamonthill/status/1450092574212042752">Hill wrote</a>. “He was also a trailblazer. But he was also a military leader and key strategist of an empire that killed countless people and undermined the sovereignty of multiple nations. In our memorials, we must be honest about all of this.”</p>

<p><u>If you are</u> waiting for an American general to resign or be fired over the drone strike that killed seven children and three men in Kabul last month, you will likely experience the meaning of infinity.</p>
<p>You might think that the Pentagon would be scrambling to find a general to take the fall for what can no longer be denied: that the U.S. military killed 10 Afghan civilians on August 29, called it a “righteous strike” against terrorists, and then had to admit the truth after journalists found out what happened. But don’t bet your bitcoin on it. The military is already saying that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/us/politics/pentagon-drone-strike-afghanistan.html">standard targeting protocols</a> were followed for the Kabul attack; the problem was a faulty assumption or two, we meant well, next time we’ll do better.</p>
<p>The generals are in a corner. If they admit that the Kabul massacre is resignation-worthy — and in a healthy society, a massacre would be — they would have to admit that resignations should have occurred after the multitude of U.S. bombings and attacks in the past 20 years that killed large numbers of civilians doing nothing more sinister than attending a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-attack/at-least-40-civilians-at-wedding-party-killed-during-nearby-u-s-backed-afghan-army-raid-idUSKBN1W80MI">wedding party</a>, seeking care <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2016/04/28/searching-for-ground-truth-in-the-kunduz-hospital-bombing/">at a hospital</a>, or <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-attack-drones/u-s-drone-strike-kills-30-pine-nut-farm-workers-in-afghanistan-idUSKBN1W40NW">picking pine nuts</a>. The Kabul bombing was an outlier only in the amount of attention it received; the killing of civilians has proven to be <a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/human">a feature</a> rather than a bug of the 9/11 wars.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->
<p>The generals who have overseen two decades of carnage in Afghanistan and Iraq are inept at winning wars, but they possess one skill in abundance: a knack for avoiding career consequences for their too-many-to-count errors. The generals, as well as the politicians who approve ever-rising military budgets, have managed to lull the country to sleep with a euphemistic lullaby about what they want us to limply understand as an infrequent phenomenon of “collateral damage.”</p>
<p>The lack of resignations, whether forced or voluntary, attests to a character trait that is not traditionally attached to U.S. generals but should be: cowardice.</p>
<h3>Moral Cowardice</h3>
<p>Let’s focus on moral cowardice. Since 2001, not a single general has had the courage to say, “Enough, I will not be part of this killing and deception any longer, it is wrong and harmful to all, here are my stars.” Again and again, the generals have <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Afghanistan-Papers/Craig-Whitlock/9781982159009">tolerated, excused, and lied</a> about <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2018/11/19/civilian-casualties-us-war-on-terror/">the slaughter of civilians in the 9/11 wars</a> — at least several hundred thousand noncombatants have been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the number is probably far higher. What happened in Kabul last month is a case study of all those pathologies of denial poured into one tragedy.</p>
<p>Courage is required to admit that you were dead wrong, to take an unpopular stand against your brethren, to cast shame on them, to bring on their disapproval. Courage is also necessary to sustain an objector in the aftermath of breaking away. Though a dissenting general would retire with a generous pension, he could forget about landing the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/09/04/mcchrystal-afghanistan-navistar-consulting-generals/">lucrative corporate gigs</a>, usually with military contractors, that shower millions of dollars on former commanders who lend their prestige to forever warfare.</p>
<p>In other words, it doesn’t require a ridiculous amount of courage for a general to do the right thing.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[2](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[2] -->
<p>We have to look elsewhere, far below the military’s upper echelons, to find the courage that ending 20 years of unlawful warfare requires. Look, for example, to Daniel Hale, who worked on the intelligence side of drone warfare for the Air Force and came to be repulsed by it. In 2015, Hale leaked classified military documents that revealed the underside of the U.S. drone program and in particular the weaknesses of its targeting protocols and its tendency to kill people who were not the intended targets. The Intercept published classified documents about problems in the U.S. drone program in an <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/drone-papers/">eight-part series</a> in late 2015.</p>
<p>“With drone warfare, sometimes nine out of 10 people killed are innocent,” Hale <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/07/27/daniel-hale-drone-leak-sentencing/">has explained</a>. “You have to kill part of your conscience to do your job. &#8230; I stole something that was never mine to take — precious human life. I couldn’t keep living in a world in which people pretend that things weren’t happening that were.”</p>
<p>Today, Hale is not pulling down six figures a year as a board member of Raytheon Technologies or Lockheed Martin. He is serving a 45-month prison sentence for violating the Espionage Act.</p>
<h3>Fire the Generals</h3>
<p>Of course, getting rid of the senior leadership of the armed forces would be an incredibly radical move, but Andrew Bacevich has put forward a plan to do just that.</p>
<p>Bacevich is a retired Army colonel who in recent decades emerged as one of the most prominent intellectual critics of American foreign and military policy. On the 20th anniversary of 9/11, he published a lightly noticed article proposing a wholesale clearance of the nation’s military leadership due to their losing streak. Its winking title was “A Modest Proposal: Fire All of the Post 9/11 Generals” — but Bacevich stressed that his piece was not a Swiftian satire.</p>
<p>“Allow me to suggest &#8230; a purge,” he <a href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2021/09/11/a-modest-proposal-fire-the-generals/">wrote</a>. “Oblige all active duty three- and four-star generals (and admirals) to retire forthwith. Rebuild the ranks of the senior officer corps with members of a younger generation willing and able to acknowledge the shortcomings of recent American military leadership at the top.”</p>
<p>To find the replacements, Bacevich suggested that the secretary of defense — though not the current one, Lloyd Austin, who was a four-star general until recently — personally interview one- and two-star generals who show promise and ask this one question: “On a scale of one-to-ten, where one is lousy, ten excellent, and five mediocre, how would you rate U.S. military performance over the past 20 years?” Generals who give a rating of five or below would proceed to the next round, consisting of writing an essay in two hours that answers the question, “What is the problem and how do we fix it?”</p>
<p>Bacevich concluded, “Those essays should provide the basis for selecting and assigning the next generation of senior leaders.”</p>
<p>There’s no need to wonder whether the next generation would be better than the present one, because Bacevich’s plan is not going to be adopted; the generals don’t want it, and the politicians don’t want it. We’re stuck with a cadre of military leaders who lack the courage to admit the dishonor of killing civilians.</p>

<p><u>Pretty much every</u> day since 9/11, the U.S. military has disciplined soldiers who failed to do their jobs properly. They have been punished for minor offenses, like being late for duty, and for serious crimes, such as murder or assault. Since 2001, there have been more than 1.3 million cases of discipline in the armed forces, according to the Pentagon&#8217;s <a href="https://jsc.defense.gov/Portals/99/Documents/Combined%20Final%20Article%20146a%20Reports%20FY20.pdf">annual reports</a> on military justice.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the generals who misled Congress and the American public about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have not needed to worry about negative consequences for their careers. After 20 years of conducting a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Afghanistan-Papers-Secret-History-War/dp/1982159006/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwssyJBhDXARIsAK98ITTGqpF5_vjPNwWjjyHnxCQiDSvFrygi1x91VBQ6JljMHm7GO-_Igy4aApHDEALw_wcB&amp;hvadid=406679762563&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9004351&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=788760049527465248&amp;hvtargid=kwd-850514860686&amp;hydadcr=20136_10153358&amp;keywords=afghanistan+papers&amp;qid=1630775566&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExVUpUQTlKMTdFN1FWJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNDMwNDE4MTJRS004WjFDRExSUCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNTI2MDAxVDJYRkxRRDJLQ1Qmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl">disinformation campaign</a> about what was really happening on the ground, not a single U.S. general has faced any punishment. The reverse happened — they were praised for their deceptively upbeat assessments and given more stars, and when they retired with generous military pensions, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/09/04/mcchrystal-afghanistan-navistar-consulting-generals/">they landed high-paying jobs</a> on corporate boards, further profiting from their disingenuousness.</span></p>
<p>This disconnect is getting new scrutiny after the collapse of the American campaign in Afghanistan. Last month, a Marine officer <a href="https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/your-marine-corps/2021/08/30/marine-relieved-for-viral-video-now-says-hes-resigning-his-commission/">posted a video</a> in which he scorched the country&#8217;s generals for the chaos of the evacuations from Kabul. His video went viral, especially on right-wing platforms <span class="s1">that prefer to focus only on the war&#8217;s final act under President Joe Biden. But Lt. Col. Stuart Scheller’s video — </span>which elicited a rapid reaction from the military’s machinery of discipline, with Scheller being relieved of his command in hours — has stirred up a deeper critique of America’s generals.</p>

<p>“Four-star general officers are treated with great respect in the U.S. military — akin to modern day viceroys,” wrote Andrew Milburn, a retired colonel, in <a href="https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/your-marine-corps/2021/09/02/fired-marines-question-about-leader-accountability-should-not-be-dismissed/">an article</a> in Marine Corps Times last week. “Their exalted position shouldn’t ­permit them to execute without ­question an interminable and costly war to no end. Or, worse, to offer ­continuous assurance that the war was going well when it wasn’t. … Despite two wars that have seen their shares of disasters — not a single general officer has been relieved of his duties for incompetence.”</p>
<p>In Afghanistan and Iraq, several hundred thousand civilians and combatants have perished (including more than 7,000 American soldiers), millions of people have become refugees, and trillions of dollars have been wasted. Politicians were responsible for this, pundits were responsible, and so-called experts from think tanks were responsible too. But the generals were closest to these wars and most aware, or should have been, of what was happening. Few were closer or profited more than two in particular: Gen. Lloyd Austin, who is now secretary of defense, and Gen. David Petraeus, one of the most lauded military figures of the past 20 years.</p>

<h3>A Meeting in Baghdad</h3>
<p>Back in 2003, Austin strode into a meeting at Baghdad’s oil refinery and demonstrated how the U.S. military was well on its way to catastrophe in the forever wars.</p>
<p>At the time, Austin was the assistant commander of the 3rd Infantry Division, the backbone of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. A month earlier, U.S. forces had seized the Iraqi capital, which quickly descended into chaos. Austin was meeting on May 12 with the director of the Daura refinery, which was the target of nightly waves of looters trying to steal whatever they could — gasoline, cars, cash, office furniture.</p>
<p>Dathar Khashab, the refinery director, had one item on his agenda.</p>
<p>“The problem is security,” he told Austin. “The most irrational things are happening in Baghdad. Yesterday I lost one of my pickups.”</p>
<p>Austin did not want to hear that the occupation was wobbling. He blamed looting on criminals released from prison by ousted Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, even though the looting was being done by pretty much anyone with a wheelbarrow or AK-47. He said things were improving every day, which they were not.</p>
<p>“We never promised to get rid of all crime in a city of 6 million, but we’re getting our hands around it,” he said. “We’re setting up new police, and we’re doing it quickly.”</p>
<p>Khashab, dressed in work overalls, was having none of it.</p>
<p>“Things are getting worse, not better,” he replied. “Continuous theft is still here.”</p>
<p>Since 9/11, U.S. generals have consistently failed to see what was happening before their eyes, or they knew what was happening and lied about it. The conversation at the Daura refinery was an early look at this syndrome. There was little doubt to anyone with a clear mind that Baghdad, at that moment, was getting more dangerous. Austin insisted on his own reality.</p>

<p>“You compare the crime statistics today, after a war, to any major city in the world — the crime you have here is less,&#8221; Austin said. &#8220;There is a perception that crime is rampant. It is not.”</p>
<p>Khashab, whom I had been shadowing for a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/08/magazine/meet-the-new-boss.html">magazine article</a>, was about to explode.</p>
<p>“But the Iraqi people in Baghdad are comparing the crime now to what they had two months ago!”</p>
<p>Austin was now visibly irritated.</p>
<p>“What you had two months ago was a brutal dictator who killed thousands of people,” he shot back.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Khashab replied, “but we did not have people stealing cars and robbing houses.”</p>
<p>The meeting came to a cold end. After Austin left, Khashab started talking about setting up booby traps to ward off the looters.</p>
<p>A few years after the invasion, Austin returned to Iraq as the commander of U.S. forces there, and later he took charge of Central Command, the headquarters for military operations in the Middle East and Afghanistan. His charmed path became even more charmed after he retired from the military. In addition to drawing a monthly pension of about $15,000, Austin <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2021/06/18/heres-how-much-secretary-of-defense-lloyd-austin-is-worth/?sh=1a36f34a63e4">joined several corporate boards</a>, including the board of directors of United Technologies Corporation, the military contractor that merged with Raytheon in 2020, from which he has received more than $1.5 million, and advisory boards at Booz Allen Hamilton and a private equity firm called Pine Island Capital Partners. Biden’s secretary of defense owns a <a href="https://taskandpurpose.com/news/secretary-defense-home/">$2.6 million mansion</a> in the Washington, D.C., area with seven bedrooms, a five-car garage, two kitchens, and a pool house.</p>
<h3>Fatal Errors</h3>
<p>In congressional testimony, in media interviews, and in speeches to their troops, Austin and the other generals who oversaw the 9/11 wars did the opposite of telling the truth.</p>
<p>“The Afghan forces are better than we thought they were,” Marine Gen. John Allen <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?304961-1/afghanistan-war-part-1">told Congress</a> in 2012, when he was commanding U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan. “This has been dramatic progress.”</p>
<p>Allen’s successor, Gen. Joseph Dunford Jr., was just as bullish.</p>
<p>“I talk a lot about winning these days, and I firmly believe that we’re on a path to win,” he said in Kabul in 2013.</p>
<p>In the same ceremony, Dunford’s deputy voiced similar optimism.</p>
<p>“You will win this war, and we will be there with you every step of the way,” said Gen. Mark Milley, who is now the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
<p>Austin, when he took his turn atop Central Command, parroted the happy talk of his predecessors. In Senate <a href="https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Austin_03-08-16.pdf">testimony</a> in 2016, he said the Afghan military was fending off the Taliban and getting “stronger and more capable.” He added, “Afghanistan remains a worthwhile and strategically necessary investment.”</p>
<p>It’s crucial to understand what the generals were <em>not</em> saying. Austin, for instance, congratulated the Afghan military for having “retaken and reestablished security in key areas, such as Kunduz.” He did not mention that the battle for Kunduz involved a U.S. aircraft <a href="https://www.msf.org/kunduz-hospital-attack-depth">attacking a hospital</a> and killing 42 civilians — doctors, nurses, patients. It was the kind of civilian slaughter that typified U.S. and Afghan military operations, and that doomed the war. Austin and an entire generation of generals did their best to avoid mentioning these inconvenient details, denying them unless they were confronted with irrefutable evidence, and then doing little in the aftermath to prevent these atrocities from reoccurring.</p>
<p>It would be dismal enough if the generals believed their own optimism, but they didn’t, as journalist Craig Whitlock’s new book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Afghanistan-Papers-Secret-History-War/dp/1982159006/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwybyJBhBwEiwAvz4G73gEcEfgdaRfImHbRCZAVSNbxHtRHf9OSCT7n6WuqZaiSnfMmrmDyBoCDMsQAvD_BwE&amp;hvadid=409998701681&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9004351&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=5348430712555934994&amp;hvtargid=kwd-850514860686&amp;hydadcr=20136_11117821&amp;keywords=afghanistan+papers&amp;qid=1630534796&amp;sr=8-3">The Afghanistan Papers</a>,” explains. Based on secret interviews the government conducted with officers and civilians who served in Afghanistan, Whitlock’s book offers overwhelming evidence that military leaders knew the war was failing and lied about it. The book cites an Army colonel, Bob Crowley, as saying that “every data point was altered to present the best picture possible.” Whitlock described the military’s upbeat assessments as “unwarranted and baseless,” adding that they “amounted to a disinformation campaign.”</p>

<h3>Failures and Lies</h3>
<p>Unlike their counterparts in the worlds of politics or journalism, members of the armed forces belong to an institution that claims to aggressively regulate itself with an internal justice system that punishes troops who violate its code of conduct. Thousands of officers and enlisted troops are court-martialed every year; some are incarcerated in military prisons, and <a href="https://jsc.defense.gov/Portals/99/Documents/Combined%20Final%20Article%20146a%20Reports%20FY20.pdf">tens of thousands</a> face lesser punishments, such as reductions in rank and other-than-honorable discharges. A review by The Intercept of the Pentagon’s annual reports on military justice, going back to 2001, shows more than 1.3 million cases of nonjudicial punishment and courts martial. While a handful of <a href="https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2017/05/17/us-navy-admiral-sentenced-to-18-months-in-fat-leonard-bribery-scandal/">top military officers</a> have been punished for bribe-taking and other offenses in recent years, there has not been a whisper of the possibility of holding combat generals to account for the carnage they perpetuated.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[5](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[5] -->
<p>“An officer who misrepresented, misled, and lied to Congress, under the standards of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, has committed a crime,” noted Paul Yingling, a retired Army officer and author of a widely read article on generals evading responsibility. “Captains and sergeants face consequences all the time if they lie or otherwise engage in dishonorable conduct. All I would ask is that we apply the same standards to the conduct of war that we apply to falsifying travel documents.”</p>
<p>Yingling’s 2007 article was titled “<a href="http://armedforcesjournal.com/a-failure-in-generalship/">A Failure of Generalship</a>” and included a now-famous line: “As matters stand now, a private who loses a rifle suffers far greater consequences than a general who loses a war.” A few years later, a similar critique came from Lt. Col. Daniel Davis, whose article in Armed Forces Journal, headlined “<a href="http://armedforcesjournal.com/purge-the-generals/">Purge the Generals</a>,” suggested that “a substantial chunk” of military leaders should be fired. In 2012, the journalist Thomas Ricks, who had spent much of his life covering and studying the U.S. military, wrote <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/11/general-failure/309148/">a slashing article</a> that described the history of American generals after 9/11 as “a tale of ineptitude exacerbated by a wholesale lack of accountability.” Ricks went on: “Ironically, our generals have grown worse as they have been lionized more and more by a society now reflexively deferential to the military.”</p>
<p>Whitlock’s book pointed to one reason the generals failed: cowardice. In one of the secret military interviews, a British general, Peter Gilchrist, who served as deputy commander of U.S. and NATO forces in the early years of the Afghanistan War, described his American counterparts cowering during meetings with then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. “This was a real cultural shock for me,” Gilchrist said. “You should see these guys — and they’re great men, grown up, intelligent, sensible, but like the jellies when it came to going in front of the SecDef.”</p>
<h3>A Narrative of Success</h3>
<p>It was 2005, still early in the disaster in Iraq, and the most famous general of the 9/11 era, David Petraeus, was telling me how wonderfully things were going.</p>
<p>At the time, Petraeus was charged with creating new Iraqi security forces after the original Iraqi army was disbanded at the start of the U.S. occupation. The bureaucracy he presided over went by the acronym MNSTC-I — Multi-National Security Transition Command-Iraq — and was headquartered in Baghdad’s Green Zone, which was ringed by miles of blast walls, razor wire, and stop-or-die checkpoints. Petraeus had four computers on his desk, giving it the look of a currency trader’s workstation, and there was a fruit bowl atop a mahogany table. He wielded a laser pointer to highlight statistics on a PowerPoint that was titled “Commanders Brief” and projected onto a flat-screen TV for his audience of two — me and another U.S. reporter.</p>
<p>The U.S. had distributed 98,000 sets of body armor to the new Iraqi forces, Petraeus said with enthusiasm, or what he wanted to be understood as enthusiasm. These Iraqi fighters had also been provided with 230 million rounds of ammunition, 100,000 Kalashnikov rifles, and 5,400 heavy machine guns. Four bases the size of Fort Drum had been established across the country, he added, with a total of 92 operational battalions of more than 40,000 troops. “People keep asking when will the Iraqis take over,” Petraeus said. “They have taken over in certain areas.”</p>
<p>This was largely a fiction. The security forces in question were embryonic, generally ineffectual, and entirely dependent on not just American supplies but on American soldiers leading the fight. Petraeus was doing what pretty much every general who served in Iraq and Afghanistan would do, stringing together any data he could find that would masquerade as a narrative of success. The statistics on his PowerPoint were vintage Vietnam — find big numbers and call them victory.</p>
<p>I was in Petraeus’s office to get his support for an embed with one of the handful of Iraqi forces that seemed willing to fight. They were called the Special Police Commandos, and Petraeus had dispatched one of his top advisers, Jim Steele, to work with them. I got a green light for the embed and caught rides on Blackhawks to Tikrit and then Samarra, north of Baghdad, where the Iraqi commandos were engaged in an offensive alongside U.S. forces.</p>
<p>The tactics employed by these U.S.-trained commandos were violently illegal. I saw detainees beaten up, I heard a prisoner scream from torture, and I witnessed a mock execution. After it became clear that I was seeing a lot of war crimes, I was abruptly told that my embed was over — grab my backpack and get on the next chopper to anywhere. I quickly made satphone calls to as many officials as I could reach in the few minutes available before being driven off the small U.S. base where I was staying; at the last moment, I was told I could continue for a few more days.</p>
<p>The cynicism of America’s most famous general emerged after the publication of my story, which had the cover headline “<a href="http://www.enterworldpressphoto.org/editie1/images/coverNYT_01.jpg">The Salvadorization of Iraq?</a>” — referring to the dirty war in El Salvador in the 1980s. I expected that Petraeus would be upset, because the tactics of his Iraqi pupils were clear violations of the Geneva Conventions. Instead, a few hours after my story was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/01/magazine/the-way-of-the-commandos.html">posted online</a>, Petraeus emailed me to request a correction that would state he was responsible for standing up the Special Police Commandos. He was upset that I hadn’t given him sufficient credit for creating these thugs in combat fatigues.</p>
<p>In 2007, Petraeus was named the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq and became famous for implementing a strategy of counterinsurgency that he portrayed as focusing on protecting civilians and winning their hearts and minds. It was the opposite of what he was hoping to get credit for with his brutish commandos two years earlier; the contrast showed the lack of sincerity in either strategy. Yet those strategies had one thing in common: They provided a justification for keeping the war going, offering an illusion of victory on the horizon.</p>

<p>Petraeus, hailed as a savior in Iraq, went on to command U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan from 2010 to 2011. While there, he painted a deceptively rosy picture of what was happening. As Whitlock notes in “The Afghanistan Papers,” Petraeus told Congress in 2011 that U.S. and Afghan soldiers were engaged in “precise, intelligence-driven operations” that killed or captured “some 360 targeted insurgent leaders” in a typical 90-day period and that the number of surveillance blimps and towers had increased from 114 to 184. “The past eight months have seen important but hard-fought progress,” he <a href="http://www.usglc.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/SASC-Petraeus-Hearing-Transcript-3152011.pdf">told</a> the House Armed Services Committee. “Key insurgent safe havens have been taken away from the Taliban. Numerous insurgent leaders have been killed or captured.”</p>
<p>But as Whitlock’s book notes, “military officers in the field knew the blizzard of numbers meant nothing.” The more important truth was that civilian casualties were rising. “The casualty figures showed that Afghanistan was growing more unstable and insecure — the exact opposite of what the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy was supposed to accomplish. U.S. intelligence assessments also cast doubt on the war’s progress. Intelligence analysts in the CIA and the military prepared reports that were far more pessimistic than the pronouncements from commanding generals in the field. But intelligence officials rarely spoke in public and their reports remained classified.”</p>
<p>Public assessments from the generals were akin to a grift. In a <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-09-03/afghanistans-corruption-was-made-in-america">scathing article</a> last week, one of Petraeus&#8217;s advisers in Afghanistan, Sarah Chayes, recalled how she made a flurry of proposals for stemming corruption in the U.S.-backed government in Kabul. &#8220;None of those plans was ever implemented,&#8221; Chayes wrote. &#8220;I responded to request after request from Petraeus until I realized that he had no intention of acting on my recommendations; it was just make-work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Petraeus continued to float upward. In late 2011 he was tapped by President Barack Obama to head the CIA, but in 2012 he was caught sharing highly classified information with his girlfriend and biographer. He resigned from the CIA but avoided the felony charges and lengthy prison sentences that ruined the lives of other people who leaked classified information. Instead, Petraeus landed a lucrative partnership at the private equity giant KKR. He often gives speeches to friendly audiences, and he frequently appears on cable television, where <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2021/09/02/afghanistan-mcmaster-backlash/">in recent days</a> he has sharply criticized the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>For military critics like Yingling, Petraeus should be answering hard questions from Congress, not getting softballs from TV hosts.</p>
<p>“Congress has the power to subpoena witnesses and compel testimony,” Yingling told The Intercept. “They can subpoena Gen. Petraeus, compel him to testify. They can put documents before him to ask him what he knew, when he knew it. And if they don’t, that failure itself is complicity.”</p>
<p>Yingling knows that his desire for an honest congressional investigation is likely a fantasy, because America’s political leaders have been co-conspirators with the generals in sustaining the bloodshed overseas. As the dust settles on 20 years of American warfare in Afghanistan, Congress is <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/09/03/democrats-defense-industry-military-budget/">on track </a>to approve a military budget that will be larger than before.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Reality Winner,</u> the most prominent and harshly punished whistleblower of the Trump era, has been released to a halfway house after serving most of her five-year sentence for leaking a classified document on Russia&#8217;s effort to hack the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</p>
<p>Court filings make clear that Winner had <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4334950-Reality-Winner-Interrogation-Transcript">wanted to make Americans aware</a> that the <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/winner-sentencing-memo.pdf">government had concluded</a> that Russia secretly tried to gain access to U.S. voting systems in 2016, contrary to what the Trump administration said in 2017. Winner was a contractor for the National Security Agency when she disclosed the document, which was <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2017/06/05/top-secret-nsa-report-details-russian-hacking-effort-days-before-2016-election/">published by The Intercept</a> in June 2017. The NSA document described phishing attempts by Russian military intelligence against local U.S. election officials — and was the most convincing evidence to emerge of the Russian effort.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>Winner was prosecuted under the Espionage Act, even though election officials in the U.S. indicated that <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2018/06/20/state-election-russia-hacking-voting-system/">it was her action</a>, rather than warnings from their own government, that had made them aware they were targets of Russian hackers. While the Obama administration had used the draconian Espionage Act against a record number of leakers, none received a sentence as long as Winner’s, who pled guilty rather than face what could have been an even longer sentence if she had gone to trial.</p>
<p>The injustice of her case was highlighted when Marina Butina, a Russian national, received an 18-month sentence in 2018 for trying to influence American political figures without registering as a foreign agent. It struck many observers as dumbfounding that an actual Russian agent would receive a lighter jail sentence than an American trying to reveal a secret Russian effort to alter the outcome of an election. Winner was even denied compassionate release during the Covid-19 pandemic — and subsequently <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/07/21/reality-winner-coronavirus/">contracted</a> the disease.</p>

<p>Although Winner was prosecuted by President Donald Trump&#8217;s Department of Justice, the decorated Air Force veteran has not received any favors from President Joe Biden. She has been released according to a normal schedule that takes account of her good behavior while behind bars, her lawyer said in a statement. Winner&#8217;s request for a pardon and commutation of her sentence has not been granted.</p>
<p>“It is wonderful news that Reality Winner is finally out of prison,” said Betsy Reed, editor-in-chief of The Intercept. “Her arrest and 63-month sentence, the longest in federal court history for the alleged crime of being a journalist’s source, was a massive injustice meant to silence other whistleblowers and threaten the practice of national security journalism. The Trump Justice Department should never have prosecuted her, and President Biden should have pardoned her.”</p>
<p>The Press Freedom Defense Fund, which is part of First Look Institute, The Intercept’s parent company, <a class="c-link" href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2017/07/11/first-look-to-support-defense-of-reality-winner-in-espionage-act-prosecution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">supported</a> Winner’s legal defense.</p>
<p>Winner was serving her sentence at a federal prison in Fort Worth, Texas, and is now in a halfway house in the state. She remains formally incarcerated. According to a <a href="https://twitter.com/alisongrinter/status/1404457754962636804">statement</a> from her lawyer, Alison Grinter Allen, &#8220;Reality and her family have asked for privacy during the transition process as they work to heal the trauma of incarceration and build back the years lost. Her release is not a product of the pardon or compassionate release process, but rather the time earned from exemplary behavior while incarcerated.&#8221;</p>

<p><u>If a war movie</u> focuses on the killing of civilians rather than the courage of soldiers, can it win an Academy Award? The conventional wisdom — “that’s improbable” — may be upended by a wrenching film about the genocide in Bosnia, “Quo Vadis, Aida?”</p>
<p>Hollywood and its American audiences typically love war movies in which soldiers are brave heroes or tragic victims, like “Saving Private Ryan,” “The Hurt Locker,” or “American Sniper.” Soldier-centered films appeal to America’s rapture for the muzzle side of warfare, what with our troops <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/war-time-an-idea-its-history-its-consequences/9780199775231">nearly always</a> at war and some <a href="http://americanempireproject.com/base-nation/">800 military bases</a> overseas. The side of war we can identify with, and have a political need to justify, is the combatant’s.</p>
<p>A nominee for best international feature film, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quo-Vadis-Aida-Jasna-Djuricic/dp/B08YP6238S">Quo Vadis, Aida?</a>” focuses not simply on the Serbs who committed mass murder in Srebrenica in 1995 or the United Nations troops who allowed it to happen, but mainly on the Bosnian civilians who were the targets. The film’s protagonist is a fictional translator for the U.N., played by the brilliant Jasna &#272;juri&#269;i&#263;, who tries to save her family from the carnage that she knows is coming. Written and directed by Jasmila &#381;bani&#263;, who lived in Sarajevo during its siege by Serb forces in the 1990s, “Quo Vadis, Aida?” has earned a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/movies/quo-vadis-aida-review.html">tremendous</a> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2021-03-09/quo-vadis-aida-review-oscar-international-feature">amount</a> of acclaim and more than a <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8633462/awards">half-dozen prizes</a> at film festivals in Europe and the U.S.</p>
<p>All of this makes for a potentially stark moment at the Oscars ceremony next month.</p>
<p>In its category, &#381;bani&#263;&#8217;s film runs <a href="https://variety.com/feature/2021-oscars-best-international-feature-predictions-1234880372/">second</a> in most <a href="https://www.nextbestpicture.com/best-international-feature-film.html">predictions</a> to the Danish entry “Another Round,” which is about four men going through a midlife crisis. Of all the Oscar races, this may be the best one to gauge whether the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is serious about honoring the kinds of films that have been neglected in its long history — neglected due to the dominating preferences of its overwhelmingly white and male membership. &#8220;Quo Vadis, Aida?&#8221; is directed by a woman, primarily about a woman, and the war victims it portrays are Muslim.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->
<p>In recent years, the Academy has made a highly publicized push to add women and people of color to its voting ranks so that the movies and actors it rewards are themselves more diverse; this has been the overdue power of the #OscarsSoWhite movement. Theoretically, this should mean that &#8220;Another Round&#8221; will not have an unwarranted advantage when votes are counted, even though there&#8217;s still a lot of progress to be made in the Academy&#8217;s membership.</p>
<p><u>“Another Round” is</u> a charming movie about Martin, Tommy, Peter, and Nikolaj, who decide to drink during the day to break out of their routinized behavior and depressed moods at the school where they teach. Boozing helps for a bit, but the results aren’t great in the long run (surprise). The film delivers the warmth that viewers tend to appreciate, and it has a rambunctious final scene. It also has a somewhat famous director, Thomas Vinterberg, and a lead actor, the superb Mads Mikkelsen, who is known in the U.S. for his TV work in “Hannibal.”</p>
<p>I can understand why it’s the front-runner. What’s not to love in a film about four straight white men in their middle ages, directed by a man, with no female character of significance, and lots of Danish modern furniture? I say that with a crooked grin because I honestly enjoyed the film, but I’m in its demographic. What&#8217;s arguably also true, as film critic Claudia Puig <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/awards/story/2020-12-31/oscars-2021-buzzmeter-gets-you-in-the-awards-season-swing#internationalfeature">observed</a>, is that it&#8217;s another &#8220;banal story of middle-age ennui.&#8221;</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[2](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[2] -->By choosing to nominate this film from Bosnia, the Academy has brought itself to the precipice of doing something that is right and courageous.<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[2] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[2] -->
<p>Therein lies the Academy’s challenge.</p>
<p>It’s not just that “Quo Vadis, Aida?” avoids patriotic notions of war as a cauldron in which soldiers touch the limits of masculine endurance and brotherhood. The demographics of its makers, cast, and characters are the opposite of Oscar bait, especially against a betting favorite that caters to sensibilities that have been favored since forever. But by choosing to nominate this film from Bosnia, the Academy has brought itself to the precipice of doing something that is right and courageous.</p>
<p>I covered the war in Bosnia, and everything in &#381;bani&#263;’s movie reflects what happened in Srebrenica, where more than 8,000 Muslims were massacred, and throughout the war: the civilian essence of wartime casualties, the caught-in-a-vise dilemma of families with no way out, the courage of noncombatants, and the cowardice of Serb forces as well as U.N. commanders. Conventional storylines are overturned. It&#8217;s not soldiers but their civilian targets who possess the qualities of dignity and love. We finally are hearing not just about the people who suffer the most in war, but from them, directly.</p>

<p>“So far, the story of Srebrenica has been told by courts, a few academics (some more, some less well-meaning), and the media,” <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/analysis/analysis-quo-vadis-aida-srebrenica-survivors-finally-telling-their-own-story/2150305">wrote</a> Emir Suljagi&#263;, one of the U.N.’s translators in Srebrenica, who now oversees the Srebrenica Memorial Center. “We, the survivors of the Bosnian genocide, have barely begun to tell our story.”</p>
<p>I wrote a <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/104880/love-thy-neighbor-by-peter-maass/">book</a> about the genocide a generation ago, when the people of Bosnia were at their lowest moment and had little access to the culture industry that lay outside their ripped-apart homeland. One of the rewards of time’s passage is the ability to see a nation’s history finally get the narrators it deserves and that the rest of us need. “Quo Vadis, Aida?” consists of a survivor telling the story of survivors in a gripping 102-minute film that fills you with horror and shame until, in its final moments, it delivers an indecipherable sliver of what might be hope.</p>
<p>It is the kind of movie that cannot be forgotten once you have seen it. The choice that faces the Academy should be an easy one.</p>

<p>In a way, this was an intimate inauguration. There was no central mass of people gathered at one spot, cheering or laughing together. It was up to each individual, each modest assembly, to gesture or shout on their own, when and how they felt the urge. At Black Lives Matter Plaza in downtown Washington, photographer Ron Haviv, on assignment for The Intercept, caught people throwing their arms into the air in celebration, defiantly refuting everything that had happened in recent years, looking ahead to a future that, their fierce expressions seemed to say, has to be better than what they just endured, and will be better.</p>

<p>It was an inauguration characterized not by vastness but by distance, because it took place beyond the view of the relatively few people who were trying to catch a glimpse of it. There will be no polemics about the size of the day’s crowd, whether it was the biggest ever or not; there is a pandemic still with us, and two weeks ago, a mob stormed the Capitol. What the celebrators caught of the ceremony was enough, even if it was on a screen.</p>
<p>So it was for the young women who gathered at one of the dark fences that turned the center of Washington, D.C., into a maddening maze. One of them holds a phone in her ungloved hand; they all look intensely at it and despite their masks, you can see, or maybe sense, that there are smiles underneath. Haviv was a few feet from them, at the moment when the motorcade bearing Biden — he was now the president — rolled past. As with most of the day’s events, the motorcade was not visible at their spot, so what sufficed for these women was the sight of Al Roker on their handheld screen telling them what was going on just out of view. We love Al Roker, they agreed, holding their coffee cups.</p>

<p>The emptiness of the streets was not a void. The distanced inauguration allowed for the time and freedom to think without interruption, without the force of a crowd around you instructing you how to feel, filling you with its emotions. There was much to think about: the riot of January 6, the years and years of delusional mobs, the impassable fences of this day, the lines of soldiers, the quiet of an event that is not supposed to be quiet, America in 2021.</p>

<p>What was it like to be there, what ideas did the day generate? &#8220;Obviously, everyone wanted to be more safe than sorry, and we&#8217;re grateful that nothing happened,&#8221; said <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/staff/akelalacy/">Akela Lacy</a>, a reporter for The Intercept who covered the day&#8217;s events. &#8220;But the feeling of victory broadcast from the inauguration was in stark contrast with how the city felt all day: empty and eerily quiet, militarized, closed off, and with far more National Guard members, police, and press than members of the public. And with all that, it still didn’t feel totally &#8216;secure.&#8217; The people of D.C. didn’t get to be part of this event today except through a screen. I think it just reflects how far we have to go to really move on from the events that started off the year, and makes me wonder what police presence in D.C. will look like in the future, and how it has and will impact people who keep the city running and weren’t part of the events today.&#8221;</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t just the troops who were a reminder of the brutal facts that a better-than-average inaugural speech could not wish away. While there was no violence on this day, there were a few people wearing the hats that we have not seen the last of, streaming their MAGA stories to followers across the nation. This day was not the occasion they had hoped for, but there are many days ahead that they hope to shape and own.</p>

<div class="module-message__text module-message__text--incoming" dir="auto">It is impossible to stay away from the soldiers on the streets, visually or politically.

<p>The capital is filled with all kinds of headquarters and edifices, including the National Press Building, across the entrance of which a line of soldiers with riot shields marched on Inauguration Day. It was a moment to stop and think, because when the mob attacked the Capitol two weeks ago, they also <a href="https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2021/reporters-covering-the-capitol-attack-were-used-to-harassment-and-heckling-but-wednesday-was-different/">attacked journalists</a> who were trying to cover the day&#8217;s events. Enemy of the people, the mob shouted, repeating a line that they had learned from their leader.</p>

<p>There is no easy explanation for the day, no single picture that says it all or most of it all. There are, despite the formations of soldiers and the still-broken windows and doors at the Capitol, images of a girl like Lily Wade, who is 8 years old and wanted her mother to bring her to the inauguration to see Kamala Harris become the first woman vice president. Lily is from Alabama. Where is she looking? Ahead, into the distance, the future.</p>

<p>There has been a nearly overnight militarization of Washington, D.C., after the U.S. Capitol was stormed by a mob of Americans inspired by the words, delusions, and narcissism of President Donald Trump — who will be known as “former president” in a merciful matter of hours. In this interregnum, between the Trump riot and the Biden presidency, the city has been turned into a geometric hive of fences and checkpoints and thousands of soldiers. It is a panorama of military occupation that most Americans would regard as the exclusive plight of <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/01/09/america-trump-violence-bosnia/">unfortunate foreigners</a>, <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/10/25/bosnia-war-us-election-politics/">not themselves</a>, <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/05/02/trump-nationalism-violence-yugoslavia/">not their country</a>.<br />

<p>Photographer Ron Haviv, on assignment for The Intercept, roams around Washington, D.C., and sees what is there and notices what is not. Haviv is one of the most lauded war photographers of our times, and what his camera captures is <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/01/19/biden-inauguration-security/">both remarkable and banal</a>. “The riot has turned a once free-looking city into a city that’s on the defensive, waiting for another attack,” Haviv observes. “But there is no visible enemy. It’s an enemy being ascertained through online chatter, through rumors. There’s no opposition in the streets, no militia, no Trump supporters. So it’s a bit surreal, all this defense against something that doesn’t physically exist at the moment.”</p>

<p>These pictures are dumbfounding. A federal building at night, with a row of streetlights on one side of the avenue and coils of barbed wire on the other. The Capitol glimpsed through the thin fabric of a flag, through a fence, through soldiers. The troops and their gear in a heap on the ground, humans and weapons and backpacks sloshed together in an indistinguishable combat green heap. There are no civilians in these pictures. The year is 2021, the month is January, the country is America, the capital and its reality are ours: We made it, we live in it, here it is.</p>

<p>Haviv was at the riot on January 6, inside the Capitol. He listened to the incendiary speech outside the White House by Trump and moved with the crowd that was under the president’s sway as it <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/01/06/trump-mob-storms-capitol-congress/">lumbered and agitated</a> its way to Congress. What Haviv saw that day and what he sees in its tense aftermath, in a city that has undergone an armed transformation to ensure that a transfer of power, already violent, does not become violent once more — it is not so extraordinary, actually.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>As Covid-19 tore</u> through the United States in the spring, a senior official in the Trump administration quietly reinforced a set of guidelines that prevented journalists from getting inside all but a handful of hospitals at the front line of the pandemic. The guidelines, citing the medical privacy law known as HIPAA, suggested a nearly impossible standard: Before letting journalists inside Covid-19 wards, hospitals needed prior permission from not only the specific patients the journalists would interview, but also other patients whose names or identities would be accessible.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/guidance-on-media-and-film-crews-access-to-phi.pdf">The onerous guidelines</a> were issued on May 5 by Roger Severino, who worked at the conservative Heritage Foundation before Donald Trump appointed him to direct the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. The guidelines made it extremely difficult for hospitals to give photographers the opportunity to collect visual evidence of the pandemic’s severity. By tightening the circulation of disturbing images, the guidelines fulfilled, intentionally or not, a key Trump administration goal: keeping public attention away from the death toll, which has surpassed 300,000 souls.</p>
<p>“The last thing hospital patients need to worry about during the Covid-19 crisis is a film crew walking around their bed shooting B-roll,” Severino said dismissively in a short press release accompanying the guidelines.</p>

<p>In the pandemic’s early days, when hospitals were first inundated with media requests, the prevailing HIPAA guidelines were quite restrictive, even on matters that had nothing to do with media access. Those guidelines predated the Trump administration and were not written for a pandemic. But the scale of the Covid-19 crisis quickly forced the Trump administration to loosen a wide range of privacy restrictions on medical providers — except, as it turned out, the ones that kept Americans from viscerally seeing the ailing and the dying.</p>
<p>For instance, HHS allowed hospitals to <a href="https://www.radarfirst.com/blog/privacy-vs-public-health-compliance-and-reporting-during-covid-19/">share Covid-19 information with first responders</a> and with <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/04/09/ocr-announces-notification-enforcement-discretion-community-based-testing-sites-during-covid-19.html">organizations involved in Covid-19 testing</a>. Hospitals were told that they would not face sanctions for <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://compliancecosmos.org/despite-temptation-keep-media-out-without-prior-authorization">sharing information</a> with the families or friends of Covid-19 patients. Doctors were freed to discuss or transfer patient information with <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/03/17/ocr-announces-notification-of-enforcement-discretion-for-telehealth-remote-communications-during-the-covid-19.html">technologies that were not secure</a>, such as email, FaceTime, and Skype. As it relaxed these restrictions, the agency said that medical providers would <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2C6iOdS_FR0">not be punished for breaches</a> of patient confidentiality if they acted in good faith during the pandemic.</p>

<p>The government’s permissiveness did not extend to journalists. The media guidelines announced by Severino in May reinforced HIPAA’s restrictions and warned hospitals that violations could bring fines in the millions of dollars. The announcement was not reported by general-interest publications, but news outlets for the health care industry <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://compliancecosmos.org/despite-temptation-keep-media-out-without-prior-authorization">noticed</a> what had happened. The headline of <a href="https://journal.ahima.org/patient-privacy-prevails-over-covid-19-media-coverage/">one of those industry stories</a> was blunt: “Patient Privacy Prevails Over Covid-19 Media Coverage.”</p>
<p>Severino’s guidance, little known outside the health care industry, may help solve one of the mysteries of the pandemic: Why have Americans seen relatively little imagery of people suffering from Covid-19? While there is a long-running debate over the influence of disturbing images of death and dying — whether they actually move public opinion — the relative paucity of videos and photographs of the pandemic’s victims might help explain why Covid-19 skepticism has thrived as the death toll in America reaches the level of a 9/11 every day.</p>
<p>“For society to respond in ways commensurate with the importance of this pandemic, we have to see it,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/opinion/coronavirus-photography.html">wrote</a> art historian Sarah Elizabeth Lewis. “For us to be transformed by it, it has to penetrate our hearts as well as our minds. Images force us to contend with the unspeakable. They help humanize clinical statistics, to make them comprehensible.”</p>

<p><u>From the moment</u> Covid-19 took hold, journalists in the United States experienced immense difficulty getting access to what amounts to ground zero of the emergency. This was not because they were not trying — they deluged hospitals with requests to document what was happening. Nor was it because doctors and nurses resisted — they clamored for more attention to the agonies endured by their patients. With infrequent exceptions, hospitals said no to the requests from journalists, often without explanation.</p>
<p>Lucas Jackson, a senior photographer for Reuters, recalls that at the start of the pandemic in March, he worked with a team at Reuters that called nearly every hospital and trauma ward in New York City. They created a spreadsheet of the hospitals and whether they had been contacted and what their response was. Only a few responded, and none granted access, even though Reuters offered Guantánamo levels of control to hospital staff, agreeing to get releases from patients and allowing hospital staff to look at all photographs to make sure no names or identities were disclosed. “If that’s what it takes, we were willing to do it,” Jackson told The Intercept.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[3] -->“Photography has played such a key role in the civil rights movement, in ending the Vietnam War, and any number of key moments in American history — and it just seems missing in action on this crisis.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[3] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[3] -->
<p>Michael Kamber, a former war photographer who directs the Bronx Documentary Center in New York City, recalls security guards shooing him off the sidewalks in front of Lincoln Medical Center. “This is the greatest loss of life on the American continent in such a concentrated time, and we’re seeing almost no images that really convey the devastation and the death,” Kamber said. “Photography has played such a key role in the civil rights movement, in ending the Vietnam War, and any number of key moments in American history — and it just seems missing in action on this crisis.”</p>
<p>Kamber, like other photographers, accepts that safety and privacy concerns need to be upheld, but he believes that those concerns are used as excuses for the repression of journalism that is manifestly in the public interest. In the cases in which hospitals have allowed journalists inside during the pandemic, there have been no privacy breaches — which proves that reporters can work at the medical front line without violating patient privacy. “The government and nearly all health care facilities have banded together in the name of protecting the privacy of the sick and have done an excellent job of keeping photographers as far away from the grief and devastation as possible,” Kamber said.</p>
<p>There have been exceptions, of course. John Moore, an award-winning photographer for Getty Images, got inside a Connecticut hospital in the early days of the pandemic. A contact with connections to the hospital vouched for Moore, removing the obstacles that were keeping others out. Even so, Moore had just one visit to the intensive care unit, working in a hurry with a communications official carrying a stack of releases that everyone he came into contact with had to sign. Moore did not take pictures of patients’ faces. “We established ground rules ahead of time, and I stuck to those,” he said.</p>
<p>Getty Images is a major photo agency that has worked hard to get its photographers into hospitals, with only rare success. “For every thousand calls or emails, you maybe get three yeses,” said Sandy Ciric, the agency’s director of photography. “Sometimes we even had the CEO say, ‘This is great, yes, we want coverage,’ and then someone tells them no and they change their mind.”</p>
<p>The exceptions demonstrate that not all the blame can be placed on the government. There is enough wiggle room in the regulations for determined hospitals to let journalists inside and trust them to follow the rules. Journalists who spoke with The Intercept noted a similarity to embeds with the U.S. military: Just as embedded war reporters were privy to sensitive information that they were trusted to keep to themselves, journalists in hospitals can be counted on to not publish patient information that they are not supposed to publish.</p>
<p>A photographer who got access to several hospitals in the early months of the pandemic expressed quiet fury that most medical facilities in the country chose to keep their doors closed. “I was not happy that I had a scoop,” said the photographer, who asked that their name not be used in order to protect their ability and their employer’s ability to continue to work inside hospitals. “I was not happy that I had exclusive access. I felt that all my colleagues should have had the same access I had. &#8230; The dearth of images of death and dying directly contributed to the disinformation [about Covid-19] and the ongoing disbelief in our country, full stop. And the hospitals have to answer for that. The hospitals bear some responsibility.”</p>

<p><u>The war metaphor</u> sheds light on why 300,000 coronavirus deaths have elicited a shallower national response than the loss of life in previous catastrophes. Domestic opposition to the war in Vietnam was shaped by imagery of U.S. soldiers as well as Vietnamese civilians in agonizing moments of injury or death. Americans were horrified to see the true face of war. Having learned its lesson, the U.S. government suppressed imagery of American casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan: The embed program aimed at preventing journalists from roaming around battlefields on their own, taking pictures of whatever they wanted.</p>
<p>Eerily, the embed <a href="https://fair.org/extra/from-self-censorship-to-official-censorship/">guidelines</a> used by the Pentagon included a prior-consent clause similar to what HIPAA, or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, demands. The guidelines prohibited war journalists from publishing pictures or videos of wounded soldiers unless they had prior written permission from the soldiers (a practical impossibility on the battlefield): “Names, video, identifiable written/oral descriptions or identifiable photographs of wounded service members will not be released without service member’s prior written consent.” The guidelines also enforced a ban on photography of the dead: “Images clearly identifying individuals ‘killed in action’ will not be released.”</p>
<p>The unifying principle between repressing photography of a war and photography of a pandemic is that a population that cannot see human carnage will not object as strongly to its perpetuation and will not care as much about the incompetence that brought it on. Hospitals and nursing homes may not have the mendacious intent of the U.S. military, but their actions have a similar effect of making it nearly impossible for ordinary Americans to be confronted with visual evidence of the true cost of the calamity that’s unfolding.</p>
<p>The Intercept reached out to a number of hospitals to ask about their media polices, including Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, Mount Sinai in New York City, and Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. The only one that responded was Massachusetts General in Boston, which provided the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>MGH has been restricting outside photographers from working in areas of the hospital where staff care for COVID patients. This is for both for the privacy of our patients and also their safety and that of our staff. Throughout the pandemic, the hospital has taken careful steps to minimize the amount of people coming to campus to ensure that only those essential for patient care and hospital operations are working in the building. While we recognize the importance of telling the story of how this pandemic has affected our patients and staff, our top priorities must always be privacy and safety. Our team has taken additional steps to make our experts, caregivers and consenting patients available to journalists remotely, as well as images and videos captured by our staff photographers.</p></blockquote>
<p>As the daily death toll reaches shocking new highs, there continues to be relatively little photography of patients in hospitals. The Intercept reviewed the front pages of the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times for the past month and found no photos of hospital patients on all but a few days. When there is photography from inside hospitals, it is almost always of doctors and nurses. The pandemic certainly gets its share of visual coverage, but the pictures tend to be surrogates of suffering, such as people wearing masks as they wait for Covid-19 tests or go about their daily routines. Because it doesn’t happen often, when a powerful photo <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/california-hospital-covid-capacity/">from inside a hospital</a> happens to emerge — such as Go Nakamura’s photo of a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/11/30/covid-photo-varon/">doctor embracing a Covid-19 patient</a> last month — it gets an enormous amount of attention.</p>

<p>“Events on this scale are understood through abstractions, which is necessary and likely helpful in terms of psychological defenses, but also results in a disconnect between people who experience it firsthand, and those who do not,” noted Dr. Elizabeth May, a psychiatry resident at a hospital in New York City. “As a physician, I wish that those close to me could really picture and see what I have seen, that I could know that they have seen this, and not feel like I need to protect their abstractions when what I really need is their support and empathy.”</p>
<p>Willingly or not, some hospitals have turned themselves into apparatuses of silence — and staff inside them are upset.</p>
<p>In April, when the first surge of the pandemic decimated New York City, a nurse at Lincoln Hospital shared video footage of herself and other staff describing the difficulty of treating Covid-19 patients without adequate protective gear or lifesaving supplies. The video was <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/04/21/coronavirus-new-york-lincoln-hospital-emergency-room/">published by The Intercept</a>, and shortly afterward, the nurse, Lillian Udel, was <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/05/09/coronavirus-nyc-nurse-hospital-hipaa/">informed by the hospital</a> that she was being investigated for HIPAA violations. That prompted another nurse at the hospital, Kelley Cabrera, to speak out. “HIPAA is kind of being used to gag people,” <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/05/09/coronavirus-nyc-nurse-hospital-hipaa/">she told The Intercept’s Akela Lacy</a>. “We’re all experiencing the most difficult working conditions we’ve ever faced. And everybody who is speaking out is doing so to advocate for patients, ultimately. It looks like hospital administrations tend to run to HIPAA for their protection, not so much patient protection.”</p>

<p>May, the psychiatry resident, noted how some hospitals, even in a pandemic, are reluctant to show what happens behind their doors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hospitals, as businesses, as profit-driven entities, do not want to be associated with death and suffering — it is very off-brand for them, I think,&#8221; said May. &#8220;So emerges an unfortunate dovetailing of HIPAA as a safeguard for civil rights and HIPAA as a vehicle for hiding off-brand aspects of medicine. &#8230; As a psychiatrist, I find myself thinking about shame and what role institutional shame has to play in the hiding of death and suffering.”</p>
<p>Dr. Elisabeth Poorman, a physician in Seattle, was particularly blunt on social media. “Americans do not respond to statistics,” she <a href="https://twitter.com/DrPoorman/status/1275282863835889664">wrote on Twitter</a> in June. “They respond to stories. Every hospital needs to let cameras in and show what dying of Covid looks like. Instead, PR depts silence us.” Responding to a commenter who said HIPAA was silencing the hospitals, Poorman shot back, “No, HIPAA is the excuse.” Earlier this month she told The Intercept, “I don’t really see things changing, because people don’t want to think creatively about this.”</p>

<p><u>When HIPAA was</u> passed in 1996, the law did not include media guidelines. That changed after hospitals, seeking to increase their profiles and their revenues, opened their doors to reality TV shows. In 2012, one of those shows, “NY Med,” which starred Dr. Mehmet Oz, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/nyregion/dying-in-the-er-and-on-tv-without-his-familys-consent.html">broadcast an episode</a> that featured a blurred-out patient in the emergency room who had been hit by a sanitation truck. The patient died, and when the episode aired, his widow happened to be watching and recognized her late husband’s voice. She was shocked. Neither she nor anyone in her family had given permission for her husband’s last moments to be filmed.</p>
<p>Four years later, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/22/nyregion/new-york-hospital-to-pay-fine-over-unauthorized-filming-of-2-patients.html">agreed to pay</a> a $2.2 million fine. HHS also <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/2023/film-and-media/index.html">announced</a> strict new guidelines that required, before journalists could enter any patient area, “prior written authorization from each individual who is or will be in the area or whose PHI [protected health information] otherwise will be accessible to the media.” These guidelines in 2016 spelled the end of reality TV shows about hospitals and unfortunately turned them into no-go zones for reporters who, unlike reality TV crews, could be trusted to behave responsibly.</p>

<p>Severino, choosing to reinforce rather than relax the 2016 guidelines, was unequivocal in May. “The Covid-19 public health emergency does not alter the HIPAA Privacy Rule’s existing restrictions on disclosures of protected health information (PHI) to the media,” his guidelines stated. “As explained in prior guidance, HIPAA does not permit covered health care providers to give the media, including film crews, access to any areas of their facilities where patients’ PHI will be accessible in any form (<em>e.g.</em> written, electronic, oral, or other visual or audio form) without first obtaining a written HIPAA authorization form <em>from each patient whose PHI would be accessible to the media</em>.” (The italics are in Severino’s guidance.)</p>
<p>Severino declined an interview request from The Intercept, but his office released a short statement in his name that said his decision to relax some HIPAA guidelines “can help save lives during the pandemic.” His statement justified the reinforced media restrictions by saying that “hospitals allowing camera crews to film Covid-19 patients in distress without their permission is a breach of trust that violates patients’ privacy rights.” But this ignores the fact that the lessons of 2012 have been learned; nobody is proposing to broadcast videos or photos of non-consenting patients. In essence, Severino is all but barring journalists from hospitals because he says they will do something that they pledge they will not do and that hospitals would not permit them to do.</p>
<p>Adam Greene, an expert on HIPAA and a partner at the law firm Davis Wright Tremaine, said it comes down to the amount of legal risk a hospital is willing to assume and the amount of time it is willing to devote to figuring that out. A hospital has to wade through a lot of regulatory questions before deciding to let a journalist inside, and that means tapping into legal resources that might be scarce or expensive. And if a decision is made to grant access, there’s always a chance that something could go wrong and a privacy breach could happen. “When you look at the incentives for hospitals, it is much easier to decline the request and avoid any risk of penalty,” Greene said. “There is not much in it for them to spend the time and resources to navigate HIPAA to find a way to do this.”</p>

<p><u>At Fox News,</u> a funny thing happened on the road to redemption.</p>
<p>As Donald Trump fell behind in the presidential vote count, Fox began pivoting away from the reality TV star it had backed for so many years. There was an early announcement by Fox that <a href="https://twitter.com/therecount/status/1323863137016307713">Arizona had been won</a> by Joe Biden. There was a reporter calling Trump’s fraud claims “<a href="https://twitter.com/johnvarian77/status/1325198395221311490">just not true</a>.” And there was an <a href="https://twitter.com/RiegerReport/status/1325921413358882827">abrupt silencing</a> of Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany by anchor Neil Cavuto. This seemed to be evidence that Fox and the Murdoch family, which owns the network, were finally turning on Trump with a weapon they had rarely aimed at him: truthfulness.</p>
<p>But then, like the <a href="http://allaboutfrogs.org/stories/scorpion.html">scorpion that stings the frog</a> in the middle of a stream, Fox did what it had always done by nature. Its primetime hosts made a frantic assault against the math of ballot counting, arguing against all evidence that Trump was right, the voting was rife with fraud, and Biden and antifa were stealing the election. The false allegations came night after night from a who’s who of <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamTrump/status/1326364881042468865">delusional thinking</a>, led by Sean Hannity and including Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, Jeanine Pirro, Jesse Watters, and Mark Levin. The network loved it, putting up a <a href="https://twitter.com/ndrew_lawrence/status/1327406000513699840">promotional spot</a> that highlighted their fabulism.</p>
<p>What was going on? Fox’s <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/11/11/fox-news-biden-trump-president-elect/">split-screen approach</a>, which consists of bouts of honesty during its less-influential daytime hours and nonstop falsehoods during its primetime programs, is actually kind of ingenious. It allows the network to wear a fig leaf of honesty in front of people living in the real world, while continuing to throw insane chum into the billion-dollar market for delusions. Nobody is entirely happy (there have been protest chants of “<a href="https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1324194510046289920">Fox News sucks</a>”), but the network’s ratings <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/526376-fox-news-wins-ratings-week-but-msnbc-touts-daytime-figures">remain strong</a>.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->
<p>Much of the discussion around misinformation has focused on the supply coming from Fox News, Facebook, and Twitter. But the latest convolutions speak to the <a href="https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/1326539335294857218">demand side of the market</a>. Thanks in large part to the decades Fox has devoted to inciting and expanding an audience for right-wing content, a lucrative market has been brought into existence. Fox’s disinformation is desired by its viewers, not forced upon them. In fact, while Fox is contaminating its daytime programming with dollops of truth, smaller TV outlets that are fiercely pro-Trump at all times, such as Newsmax and One America News, are seeing <a href="https://apnews.com/article/newsmax-sudden-competitor-fox-news-bddb5f123fe8d187570129a8425c7303">remarkable gains</a>. This appetite for political fantasies was noted by Al Schmidt, a city commissioner in Philadelphia who forcefully denied unfounded claims that ballots had been cast in the name of dead voters. As the Republican <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRickyDavila/status/1326583837741125632">told CNN</a>, “One thing I can’t comprehend is how hungry people are to consume lies and to consume information that is not true.”</p>
<p>Yochai Benkler, the lead author of an excellent book on disinformation “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Network-Propaganda-Manipulation-Disinformation-Radicalization/dp/0190923636">Network Propaganda</a>,” has devoted much of his life to studying the internet and communication. In an interview, he noted that “the market structure of this niche of the outrage industry really does discipline the outlets.” He pointed out that the most prominent conservative publication that turned on Trump in recent years — the Weekly Standard — was <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/the-closing-of-the-weekly-standard-makes-neoconservatisms-exile-from-the-republican-party-official">abruptly closed</a> in 2018. When there’s a choice between being truthful and being profitable, it’s an easy call for right-wing media executives. “To be surprised that business puts profits ahead of ethics is to miss the fundamental spring mechanism of capitalism,” Benkler said.</p>

<p>But this isn’t just a matter of future revenue for Fox and the Murdochs. The primetime fraud clamor has the effect of creating a false narrative that will likely deform the U.S. political system for years ahead. About half of Republicans in a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll/half-of-republicans-say-biden-won-because-of-a-rigged-election-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKBN27Y1AJ">new Reuters/Ipsos poll</a> believe that Trump “rightfully won” the election, and according to a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/09/republicans-free-fair-elections-435488">Politico poll</a>, 70 percent of Republicans do not believe the election was free or fair — even though, it bears repeating, there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud, and nearly every day another court in the nation tosses out another unfounded lawsuit from the Trump campaign. Of course, the campaign’s tweets and statements reach an audience without amplification by Fox News, but the amplification is <a href="https://www.cjr.org/analysis/trump-twitter-disinformation-voter-fraud-election.php">crucial oxygen</a> that gives vigorous life to the delusions.</p>
<p>What this means, once Biden is inaugurated in January, is that a bitter portion of the electorate will likely regard his presidency as illegitimate — a presidency of stolen votes. It takes little imagination to envision four years of far-right kneecapping of Biden based on this fraudulent narrative of fraud. It would be a new form of birtherism but more virulent and durable because Fox has seeded it so deeply and widely — and seems intent to continue doing so. Even if Trump shambles off to a post-presidential bog of legal jeopardy and incoherent tweets, the Republican Party will have the weapon it needs to inflict the damage it wants.</p>

<p>In the end, as journalism professor Bill Grueskin <a href="https://twitter.com/BGrueskin/status/1056168760690786304">has noted</a>, it boils down to the toxic choices of Rupert Murdoch and his heirs. Fox News is owned and controlled by the Murdoch family, which is presided over by its 89-year-old patriarch, Rupert, who founded the network in 1996. His oldest son, Lachlan, is now the chief executive of Fox&#8217;s parent company. Rupert’s five other children — Prudence, Elisabeth, James, Chloe, and Grace — <a href="https://www.afr.com/companies/media-and-marketing/trouble-in-the-murdoch-trust-fund-20200807-p55jh3">hold ownership shares</a> of the family’s assets but do not currently have any active management responsibilities. The Murdoch family is collectively worth about <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rupert-murdoch-wife-net-worth-family-news-corp-companies-2019-2">$17 billion</a>.</p>
<p>It’s somewhat understandable why Hannity would shout about election fraud even though he must know the charges are bogus. His ratings depend on providing the false narratives that his viewers demand; if his audience shrinks, he could lose his show and the clamor he clearly adores. The out-of-the-spotlight Murdoch family does not have that excuse, because their financial situation and their day-to-day lives would not be affected by a ratings decline. They could fire Hannity and Carlson and still be assured of possessing enough money to acquire luxury yachts and country estates for generations of their spawn.</p>
<p>What explains the choices of Fox’s owners? The mechanisms of capitalism are recalibrated when the law or the markets demand it. The Murdochs have built a machine that’s operating as designed — the markets are rewarding them with billions of dollars a year while the First Amendment is shielding them from liability for <a href="https://twitter.com/akarl_smith/status/1329093895590973440">the damage they cause</a>. The Murdochs are capitalists, Benkler observed, not ethicists. “They are sitting on this incendiary device that is burning down the house,” he said, “but they are not the first or the last willing to make money off destroying lives.”</p>
