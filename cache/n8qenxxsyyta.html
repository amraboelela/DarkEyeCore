The U.S. claimed it did not intend to kill Samir Khan, who was traveling with Awlaki when a Hellfire hit their vehicle. The third — and most controversial — killing of a U.S. citizen was that of Awlaki’s son, 16-year-old Abdulrahman Awlaki. He was killed two weeks after his father, while having dinner with his cousin and some friends. Immediately after the strike, anonymous U.S. officials asserted that the younger Awlaki was connected to al Qaeda and was 21 years old.

That’s all garbage. The Obama administration has been quite ruthless in its pursuit of terrorists.

According to \u003ca href=\"/document/2015/10/14/small-footprint-operations-5-13/#page-3\">one slide\u003c/a>, as of 2012 the base at Camp Lemonnier housed more than a dozen armed drones and additional surveillance aircraft. Its arsenal also included eight manned F-15E warplanes, which can carry so-called bunker busters — 5,000-pound laser-guided bombs.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The ISR Task Force recommended providing special operations forces with more and better drones and an enhanced mandate to capture and interrogate suspects “via host-nation partners.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Outsourcing U.S. kill/capture operations to local forces, which occurred frequently throughout the Bush administration’s time in office, regularly led to human rights abuses, torture, and extrajudicial killings. “I’m very hesitant on backing foreign militaries or paramilitary forces or militias,” said Clinton Watts, a former FBI special agent who worked on counterterrorism and later served as an executive officer of the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point. “I’ve seen that up close before and you’re backing rape and pillage campaigns through the countryside, usually. You can’t control them and you don’t have transparency over what they do and it blows up in your face the same way that a bad drone strike does.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The ISR Task Force asserted that an increase in the number of capture operations \u003ca href=\"/document/2015/10/14/small-footprint-operations-2-13/#page-12\">could be achieved\u003c/a> by using U.S. “advisors” to build partnerships with local forces and by conducting “advance force operations.” AFOs are used by the U.S. military to discreetly plant tracking devices, conduct surveillance, and physically access places inhabited by potential targets, often in “denied areas” where the U.S. is not yet at war. Forces deployed in AFOs \u003ca href=\"http://fas.org/man/eprint/respass.pdf\">may also conduct\u003c/a> clandestine “direct actions,” including kill/capture operations.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>During the Bush administration, AFOs served as a primary vehicle for justifying the \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/24/politics/pentagon-sends-its-spies-to-join-fight-on-terror.html\">clandestine deployment\u003c/a> of U.S. special operators \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/world/asia/the-secret-history-of-seal-team-6.html?_r=0\">across the world\u003c/a> to engage in “\u003ca href=\"http://fas.org/man/eprint/respass.pdf\">operational preparation\u003c/a>” of a future battlespace.

Gen. Flynn, who served for years as the chief intelligence officer for JSOC. “You cannot conduct counterinsurgency, counterterrorism, or counter-guerrilla operations without having effective interrogation operations,” Flynn said in an interview. “If the president says, &#8216;Defeat this enemy,&#8217; but you say you need resources that you never get, you just can’t defeat the enemy.

The same month the ISR study was circulated — May 2013 — Obama signed the policy guidance on the use of force in counterterrorism operations overseas. A senior administration official, who declined to comment on the classified documents, told \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em> that &#8220;those guidelines remain in effect today.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>U.S. intelligence personnel collect information on potential targets, as \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em> has \u003ca href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/08/05/watch-commander/\">previously reported\u003c/a>, drawn from \u003ca href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/07/23/blacklisted/\">government watchlists\u003c/a> and the work of intelligence, military, and law enforcement agencies. At the time of the study, when someone was destined for the kill list, intelligence analysts created a portrait of a suspect and the threat that person posed, pulling it together “in a condensed format known as a ‘baseball card.’” That information was then bundled with operational information and packaged in a “target information folder” to be “staffed up to higher echelons” for action. On average, it took 58 days for the president to sign off on a target, \u003ca href=\"/document/2015/10/15/small-footprint-operations-2-13/#page-41\">one slide\u003c/a> indicates.

The documents acknowledge that using metadata from phones and computers, as well as communications intercepts, is an inferior method of finding and finishing targeted people. They described SIGINT capabilities in these unconventional battlefields as “poor” and “limited.” Yet such collection, much of it provided by foreign partners, accounted for more than half the intelligence used to track potential kills in Yemen and Somalia. The ISR study characterized these failings as a technical hindrance to efficient operations, omitting the fact that \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/world/asia/drone-strikes-reveal-uncomfortable-truth-us-is-often-unsure-about-who-will-die.html\">faulty intelligence\u003c/a> has led to the killing of innocent people, \u003ca href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/american-italian-hostages-killed-in-cia-drone-strike-in-january-1429795801\">including\u003c/a> U.S. citizens, in drone strikes.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The source underscored the unreliability of metadata, most often from phone and computer communications intercepts. These sources of information, identified by so-called selectors such as a phone number or email address, are the primary tools used by the military to find, fix, and finish its targets. “It requires an enormous amount of faith in the technology that you’re using,” the source said. “There’s countless instances where I’ve come across intelligence that was faulty.” This, he said, is a primary factor in the killing of civilians. “It’s stunning the number of instances when selectors are misattributed to certain people. And it isn’t until several months or years later that you all of a sudden realize that the entire time you thought you were going after this really hot target, you wind up realizing it was his mother’s phone the whole time.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Within the special operations community, the source said, the internal view of the people being hunted by the U.S. for possible death by drone strike is: “They have no rights. They have no dignity. They have no humanity to themselves. They’re just a ‘selector’ to an analyst. You eventually get to a point in the target’s life cycle that you are following them, you don’t even refer to them by their actual name.” This practice, he said, contributes to “dehumanizing the people before you’ve even encountered the moral question of ‘is this a legitimate kill or not?’”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>By the ISR study’s own admission, killing suspected terrorists, even if they are “legitimate” targets, further hampers intelligence gathering. The secret study states bluntly: “Kill operations significantly reduce the intelligence available.” A chart shows that special operations actions in the Horn of Africa resulted in captures just 25 percent of the time, indicating a heavy tilt toward lethal strikes.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2 class=\"sq-head-alt\">Strikes often kill many more than the intended target\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003ca class=\"sq-article-link\" href=\"/drone-papers/manhunting-in-the-hindu-kush\">\u003cimg src=\"/wp-uploads/sites/1/2015/10/GettyImages-107990394-promo.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\u003cspan class=\"\">Read more\u003c/span>\u003cbr />\nManhunting in the Hindu Kush\u003c/a> The White House and Pentagon boast that the targeted killing program is precise and that civilian deaths are minimal. However, documents detailing a special operations campaign in northeastern Afghanistan, Operation Haymaker, show that between January 2012 and February 2013, U.S. special operations airstrikes killed more than 200 people. Of those, only 35 were the intended targets. During one five-month period of the operation, according to the documents, nearly 90 percent of the people killed in airstrikes were not the intended targets. In Yemen and Somalia, where the U.S. has far more limited intelligence capabilities to confirm the people killed are the intended targets, the equivalent ratios may well be much worse.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Anyone caught in the vicinity is guilty by association,” the source said.

This appears due, in large part, to the fact that Afghanistan and Iraq were declared war zones, and in Iraq the U.S. was able to launch attacks from bases closer to the targeted people. By contrast, in Somalia and Yemen, undeclared war zones where strikes were justified under tighter restrictions, U.S. attack planners described a serpentine bureaucracy for obtaining approval for assassination. The secret study states that the number of high-value targeting operations in these countries was “significantly lower than previously seen in Iraq and Afghanistan” because of these “constraining factors.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Even after the president approved a target in Yemen or Somalia, the great distance between drone bases and targets created significant challenges for U.S. forces — a problem referred to in the documents as the “tyranny of distance.” In Iraq, more than 80 percent of “finishing operations” were conducted within 150 kilometers of an air base. In Yemen, the average distance was about 450 kilometers and in Somalia it was more than 1,000 kilometers. On average, one document states, it took the U.S. six years to develop a target in Somalia, but just 8.3 months to kill the target once the president had approved his addition to the kill list.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2 class=\"sq-head-alt\">Inconsistencies with White House statements about targeted killing\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003ca class=\"sq-article-link\" href=\"/drone-papers/the-kill-chain\">\u003cimg src=\"/wp-uploads/sites/1/2015/10/KC_HeadsRedacted01-promo.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\u003cspan class=\"\">Read more\u003c/span>\u003cbr />\nKill Chain\u003c/a>The White House’s publicly available policy standards state that lethal force will be launched only against targets who pose a “continuing, imminent threat to U.S. persons.” In the documents, however, there is only one \u003ca href=\"/document/2015/10/15/small-footprint-operations-5-13/#page-6\">explicit mention\u003c/a> of a specific criterion: that a person “presents a threat to U.S. interest or personnel.” While such a rationale may make sense in the context of a declared war in which U.S. personnel are on the ground in large numbers, such as in Afghanistan, that standard is so vague as to be virtually meaningless in countries like Yemen and Somalia, where very few U.S. personnel operate.\u003c/p>\n\u003c/div>\n\u003cp>While many of the documents provided to \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em> contain explicit internal recommendations for improving unconventional U.S. warfare, the source said that what’s implicit is even more significant.

Under Brennan, the nominations process was reportedly concentrated in the White House, \u003ca href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/content/who-will-drones-target-who-us-will-decide\">replacing\u003c/a> video conferences once run by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/plan-for-hunting-terrorists-signals-us-intends-to-keep-adding-names-to-kill-lists/2012/10/23/4789b2ae-18b3-11e2-a55c-39408fbe6a4b_story.html\">elevating\u003c/a> the role of the National Counterterrorism Center in organizing intelligence. Later in 2013, the White House \u003ca href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/why-white-house-blessed-recent-yemen-drone-strikes-f6C10936036\">reportedly\u003c/a> tightened control over individual strikes in Yemen.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At the time of the study, with the president’s approval, JSOC had a 60-day window to hit a target. For the actual strike, the task force needed approval from the Geographic Combatant Command as well as the ambassador and CIA station chief in the country where the target was located. For a very important target, such as al Qaeda-linked preacher Anwar al Awlaki, who was a U.S. citizen, “it would take a high-level official to approve the strike,” said Lt. Col. Mark McCurley, a former drone pilot who worked on operations in Yemen and recently published a \u003ca href=\"http://www.penguin.com/book/hunter-killer-by-t-mark-mccurley-kevin-maurer/9780525954439\">book about his experiences\u003c/a>. “And that includes a lot of lawyers and a lot of review at different levels to reach that decision. We have an extensive chain of command, humans along the whole link that monitor the entire process from start to finish on an airstrike.” The country’s government was also supposed to sign off. “One Disagrees = STOP,” the slide notes, with a tiny red stop sign.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In practice, the degree of cooperation with the host nation has varied. Somalia’s minister of national security, Abdirizak Omar Mohamed, told \u003cem>The Intercept\u003c/em> that the United States alerted Somalia’s president and foreign minister of strikes “sometimes ahead of time, sometimes during the operation &#8230; normally we get advance notice.” He said he was unaware of an instance where Somali officials had objected to a strike, but added that if they did, he assumed the U.S. would respect Somalia’s sovereignty.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>By 2011, when the study’s time frame began, Yemen’s president Ali Abdullah Saleh was in crisis. Facing domestic protests during the Arab Spring, he left the country in June 2011 after being injured in a bombing. Both the CIA and JSOC stepped up their drone campaigns, which enjoyed \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/29/world/middleeast/yemens-leader-president-hadi-praises-us-drone-strikes.html\">vocal support\u003c/a> from Saleh’s eventual successor, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“It was almost never coordinated with Saleh. Once Hadi became president, March 2012, there was a big chance we’d be in the loop” before drone strikes were conducted, said a former senior Yemeni official who worked for both the Saleh and Hadi governments.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Today, with Yemen’s capital under the control of the Houthi rebel group and undergoing bombardment by Saudi Arabia, administration lawyers \u003ca href=\"http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-yemen-houthis-20150206-story.html\">do not seem worried\u003c/a> about asking permission to carry out drone strikes amid the fray.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Now, I think they don’t even bother telling anyone. There is really no one in charge to tell,” said the former Yemeni official, who requested anonymity citing current unrest and the fact that he no longer works for the government.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>Who Can Be Targeted\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>Both the Bush and Obama administrations have maintained that the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, or AUMF, permits the pursuit of members of al Qaeda and its affiliates wherever they may be located.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Pentagon study refers throughout to operations that fall under AUMF. But it also underlines how the targeted killing campaigns differ from traditional battlefields, \u003ca href=\"https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/document/2015/10/14/small-footprint-operations-2-13/#page-6\">noting\u003c/a> that the region is located “Outside a Defined Theater of Active Armed Conflict,” which limits “allowable U.S. activities.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Obama administration officials \u003ca href=\"https://www.propublica.org/documents/item/425630-crs-targeted-killing#document/p12/a71709\">have said\u003c/a> that in addition to being a member of al Qaeda or an associated force, targets must also pose a significant threat to the United States. In May 2013, facing increasing pressure to fully admit the existence of the drone war and especially to address allegations of civilian harm, the White House \u003ca href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/23/fact-sheet-us-policy-standards-and-procedures-use-force-counterterrorism\">released\u003c/a> policy guidelines for lethal counterterrorism operations that seemed to further restrict them. In a \u003ca href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/23/remarks-president-national-defense-university\">speech\u003c/a>, Obama announced that action would be taken only against people who posed a “continuing, imminent threat to the American people,” and who could not be captured. A strike would only occur with “near certainty” that no civilians would be killed or injured.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Even with the new guidelines, \u003ca href=\"http://opiniojuris.org/2011/05/21/no-the-un-has-not-affirmed-that-the-us-is-engaged-in-an-armed-conflict-with-al-qaeda/\">legal observers\u003c/a>, particularly \u003ca href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/07/31/us-reassess-war-model-against-al-qaeda\">human rights lawyers\u003c/a>, have disputed the Obama administration’s position that the U.S., in strict legal terms, is in an armed conflict with al Qaeda in Yemen or Somalia — and therefore dispute what standards should apply to strikes. Others question the extent to which the hundreds of people killed in drone strikes in those countries meet the supposedly strict criteria.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“I think there can be questions raised about how stringently some of the requirements are being applied,” said Jennifer Daskal, an assistant professor of law at American University who worked for the Department of Justice from 2009 to 2011. “Near certainty of no civilian deaths, is that really imposed? What does it mean for capture not to be feasible?

The process often depends on assumptions or best guesses in provinces like Kunar or Nuristan, the source said, particularly if the dead include “military-age males,” or MAMs, in military parlance. “If there is no evidence that proves a person killed in a strike was either not a MAM, or was a MAM but not an unlawful enemy combatant, then there is no question,” he said. “They label them EKIA.” In the case of airstrikes in a campaign like Haymaker, the source added, missiles could be fired from a variety of aircraft. “But nine times out of 10 it’s a drone strike.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The source is deeply suspicious of those airstrikes — the ones ostensibly based on hard evidence and intended to kill specific individuals — which end up taking numerous lives. Certainty about the death of a direct target often requires more than simply waiting for the smoke to clear. Confirming a chosen target was indeed killed can include days of monitoring signals intelligence and communication with sources on the ground, none of which is perfect 100 percent of the time. Firing a missile at a target in a group of people, the source said, requires “an even greater leap of faith” — a leap that he believes often treats physical proximity as evidence.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The documents include slides focused specifically on Haymaker operations from January 2012 to February 2013, distinguishing between raids, described as “enabled” and “combined” operations, and airstrikes, which are described as “kinetic strikes.” In both cases, raids and airstrikes, the source said the target was always an individual person. “Every mission that’s triggered begins as an objective to find one person for whatever reason,” the source said, adding, “Every jackpot is one person off the list.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>According to the documents, raids performed on the ground during Haymaker were far less lethal than airstrikes and led to the capture of scores of individuals. Research by Larry Lewis, formerly a principal research scientist at the Center for Naval Analyses, supports that conclusion. Lewis spent years studying U.S. operations in Afghanistan, including raids, airstrikes, and jackpots, all with an eye to understanding why civilian casualties happen and how to better prevent them. His contract work for the U.S. military, much of it classified, included a focus on civilian casualties and informed tactical directives issued by the top generals guiding the war. During his years of research, what Lewis uncovered in his examination of U.S. airstrikes, particularly those delivered by machines thought to be the most precise in the Pentagon’s arsenal, was dramatic. He \u003ca href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/02/us-drone-strikes-afghan-civilians\">found \u003c/a>that drone strikes in Afghanistan were 10 times more likely to kill civilians than conventional aircraft.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“We assume that they’re surgical but they’re not,” Lewis said in an interview. “Certainly in Afghanistan, in the time frame I looked at, the rate of civilian casualties was significantly higher for unmanned vehicles than it was for manned aircraft airstrikes. And that was a lot higher than raids.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The limited point of view of the drone’s camera, what Lewis describes as the “soda straw effect,” together with the globally dispersed operational network that supports drone strikes, can lead to mistakes, he argues, including the loss of innocent lives. The materials obtained by \u003cem>The Intercept \u003c/em>make just one explicit mention of civilian casualties, in the Task Force 3-10 mission statistics from September 2011 through September 2012.

The problem, he said, is that savvy, opportunistic strongmen maneuvered to draw U.S. forces into local conflicts, a dynamic that played out again and again throughout the war. “We knew nothing about who we were shooting at — specifically in Kunar,” Trevithick said. He understands the frustration of conventional U.S. forces who were dropped in places like Kunar. “I don’t blame them,” he said. “They’re put in an impossible situation themselves. But what happens is everyone starts looking like the enemy. And that means you start shooting. And that means people actually do become the enemy.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In September 2010, nine years after the terrorist attacks in New York City, the U.S. military and coalition forces were working their way through a list of 744 people slated for death or capture in Afghanistan. According to the so-called Joint Prioritized Effects List (JPEL), provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, Kunar, with 44 targets, had the third-highest total in the country. Few of the Kunar targets represented core al Qaeda-linked figures, and many were associated with local groups like the Salafists, whose listed offenses typically included attacks on Western and Afghan government forces in the province. The targets on the 2010 list were prioritized with rankings of one to four, in terms their significance, with one being the most significant. In Kunar, a single target rose to the level of priority one, while more than 80 percent were designated priority three. Seven of the JPEL targets appear in the Haymaker slides, though just three had been linked to al Qaeda. Regardless of their associations, the U.S. ultimately devoted the same resources to picking off locally affiliated militants as it did to the campaign against the group responsible for 9/11.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>After nearly a decade of war, thousands of operations, and thousands of deaths, some within the special operations community began to question the quality of the United States’ targets in Afghanistan. “By 2010, guys were going after street thugs,” a former SEAL Team 6 officer \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/world/asia/the-secret-history-of-seal-team-6.html\">told\u003c/a> the \u003cem>New York Times\u003c/em> recently. “The most highly trained force in the world, chasing after street thugs.” Concerns that the U.S. was devoting tremendous resources to kill off a never-ending stream of nobodies did little to halt the momentum.\u003c/p>\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(photo)[7](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PHOTO%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22RESOURCE%22%7D)(%7B%22scroll%22%3Afalse%2C%22align%22%3A%22bleed%22%2C%22bleed%22%3A%22full%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22auto%22%7D) --\>\u003cdiv class=\"img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto\" style=\"width: auto;\">\u003c!-- CONTENT(photo)[7] --\>\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-6477\" src=\"/wp-uploads/sites/1/2015/10/17871494565_f44640bc74_o-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"Uniformed and civilian cyber and military intelligence specialists monitor Army networks in the Cyber Mission Unit’s Cyber Operations Center at Fort Gordon, Ga.

Unleashed in the early morning hours of October 3, in the province of Kunduz, the U.S. attack killed at least a dozen members of the humanitarian group’s medical staff and 10 patients, including three children. A nurse on the scene recalled seeing six victims in the intensive care unit ablaze in their beds. “There are no words for how terrible it was,” the nurse \u003ca href=\"http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/unspeakable-msf-nurse-recounts-attack-msfs-kunduz-hospital\">said\u003c/a>.

In August, the United Nations \u003ca href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=51563#.VedLLlzeyfR\">reported\u003c/a> that civilian casualties in Afghanistan “are projected to equal or exceed the record high numbers documented last year.” While most civilian casualties in the first half of 2015 were attributed to “anti-government” forces, 27 deaths and 22 injuries were attributed to airstrikes “by international military forces,” a 23 percent increase over last year, most of them, unlike the air raid in Kunduz, carried out by drones.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Despite the rise in civilian casualties and the well-documented failure of drone strikes to achieve the military’s broader objectives, there is every indication that unmanned airstrikes will play an increasing role in U.S. military engagement in Afghanistan, as they have in war zones across the world. Less than two weeks after the U.N. issued its report, \u003cem>Foreign Policy\u003c/em> \u003ca href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/08/14/easing-off-the-taliban/\">revealed\u003c/a> that JSOC has drastically reduced the number of night raids it conducts in Afghanistan, while dramatically increasing its reliance on airstrikes, and is currently “on pace to double the rate at which it kills ‘high-value individuals’ using kinetic strikes, compared to how many it was killing that way five years ago.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Afghanistan’s northeastern border with Pakistan remains an active area of focus for the remaining U.S. special operations forces in the country. The Pech Valley, once a hotspot during the Haymaker campaign, continues to host a constellation of armed groups. Al Qaeda, the organization used to justify both the invasion of Afghanistan and the Haymaker campaign, reportedly enjoys a more pronounced presence in the valley than ever. “The al Qaeda presence there now,” according to a \u003ca href=\"http://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/SR382-Ten-Years-in-Afghanistans-Pech-Valley.pdf\">report \u003c/a>by the United States Institute for Peace, “is larger than when U.S. counterterrorism forces arrived in 2002.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>With JSOC and the CIA running a \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-launches-secret-drone-campaign-to-hunt-islamic-state-leaders-in-syria/2015/09/01/723b3e04-5033-11e5-933e-7d06c647a395_story.html\">new drone war\u003c/a> in Iraq and Syria, much of Haymaker’s strategic legacy lives on. Such campaigns, with their tenuous strategic impacts and significant death tolls, should serve as a reminder of the dangers fallible lethal systems pose, the intelligence community source said. “This isn’t to say that the drone program is a complete wash and it’s never once succeeded in carrying out its stated purpose,” he pointed out. “It certainly has.” But even the operations military commanders would point to as successes, he argued, can have unseen impacts, particularly in the remote communities where U.S. missiles so often rain down. “I would like to think that what we were doing was in some way trying to help Afghans,” the source explained, but the notion “that what we were part of was actually defending the homeland or in any way to the benefit of the American public” evaporated long ago. “There’s no illusion of that that exists in Afghanistan,” he said. “It hasn’t existed for many years.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">\u003cem>Top Photo: Ed Darack/Getty

Despite his apparent instruction at an al Qaeda-affiliated camp, he was not arrested on his way back to England, suggesting that intelligence collected by the U.S. about his whereabouts might not have been immediately shared with British agencies. Lynne Arnold, a spokesperson for London&#8217;s Metropolitan Police, declined to answer questions for this story, saying she was &#8220;not able to discuss&#8221; why Berjawi was not arrested or whether U.S. authorities had shared any information about him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>According to the interview conducted by Cage, which campaigns on behalf of terrorism suspects who are denied legal rights, Berjawi did not begin to notice that British authorities were interested in him until about 2007.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That year, counterterrorism forces in Nairobi detained two of Berjawi’s friends from London, who had fled Somalia after war broke out with Ethiopia. The pair were later released without charge. Upon their return to London, the men told Berjawi that during their detention in Kenya, British agents had questioned them and shown them his photograph.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“That’s when I realized myself I was starting to be followed,” Berjawi said. “I would see someone — the same person — following me, wherever I was. The same car — I actually even memorized the number plate.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Berjawi’s suspicions appear to have been further confirmed between 2007 and 2008. During a trip to Lebanon, he was stopped at a Lebanese airport and questioned about why he had traveled to the country. He told the authorities he was visiting family, gave them a phone number for his uncle, and eventually they let him through. Berjawi was interrogated again on his way out of Lebanon, but arrived back in London without any problems. A few days after his return, however, Berjawi called his uncle and learned that he had been approached by Lebanese counterterrorism agents, who had been asking questions about him.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cu>\u003cspan class=\"dropcap\">B\u003c/span>Y EARLY 2009, BERJAWI\u003c/u> was working in London with his stepfather as a plumber and air-conditioning engineer.

But Berjawi was still on the radar of security agencies, and he was about to experience his first serious interrogation.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>With a childhood friend named Mohamed Sakr, Berjawi arranged a trip to Kenya. According to his account, he wanted to go on a wildlife safari, but counterterrorism officials in Kenya suspected otherwise.

The main part of the house had four bedrooms, but there were two additional bedrooms in a separate wing that the family kept for guests.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Recalling how he first came into contact with Berjawi and Sakr, Mansour told me that he put them up as a favor to a friend named Mohamed, whom he had met in Dubai while working briefly for a tech company there that provided information security services.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>According to Mansour, Berjawi and Sakr claimed they had traveled to Kenya to research a substance known as “miraa” — or khat — an amphetamine-like stimulant grown and consumed in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Mansour’s first impression of the pair was that they were “regular Joes.” They lounged around the house, watched movies, played games with his children, and occasionally prayed. “But they didn’t seem like hardcore, staunch Muslims,” Mansour said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At first, Berjawi and Sakr said they would only need a place to stay for a few days. But a few days soon turned into a week. When Mansour asked about their plans, he was told they were waiting for some money to be sent to them before they moved on.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“I didn’t feel like they were a threat in any way, even when they overstayed,” said Mansour. “The only strange thing that I noticed from them the whole time is that it seemed like they weren’t trying to go out; they weren’t trying to leave the house.”\u003c/p>\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(photo)[4](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PHOTO%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22RESOURCE%22%7D)(%7B%22scroll%22%3Afalse%2C%22align%22%3A%22bleed%22%2C%22bleed%22%3A%22full%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22auto%22%7D) --\>\u003cdiv class=\"img-wrap align-bleed full-bleed width-auto\" style=\"width: auto;\">\u003c!-- CONTENT(photo)[4] --\>\u003cimg class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-6609\" src=\"/wp-uploads/sites/1/2015/10/PeckhamJourney01.png\" alt=\"\" />\n\u003cp class=\"caption source pullright\">Illustration: The Intercept\u003c/p>\u003c!-- END-CONTENT(photo)[4] --\>\u003c/div>\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(photo)[4] --\>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Suddenly, about two weeks into their stay, in February 2009, Kenyan anti-terror police surrounded Mansour’s Nairobi house. Berjawi was playing pool in the games room when he heard a loud series of knocks at the door. He peered through a curtain and saw heavily armed Kenyan officers, a helicopter flying above, and lots of cars. The police then stormed the property, told Berjawi to get on the floor, and pointed a gun at his head while he was searched.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Berjawi told Cage that he and Sakr were handcuffed, taken to the anti-terror police headquarters, and placed in separate cells. Berjawi described his cell as a “black hole” with “no pillows, no light, nothing,” and said that when he asked for food a guard told him that he had to drink his own urine.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Later that day, Berjawi said he was taken from his cell through a long dark corridor to a private room. He was dazzled by the bright lights when the door opened, but when his eyes regained focus he could see about five men, dressed smartly in suits.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“They looked like professional people, y’know, they didn’t look like they belonged there,” Berjawi later recalled. “You could tell the difference between them and the guards that were working there. With the guards you can smell the sweat on them, and some of them were even drunk.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Berjawi said the men accused him of being an al Qaeda suicide bomber who had come to Kenya as part of a plot to attack the Israeli Embassy and an Israeli-owned supermarket. He denied the allegations and requested a lawyer. “My friend, this is Africa,” he recalled being told. “In Africa, the only thing we can give you is black magic.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For four days, Berjawi and Sakr were held in custody and repeatedly interrogated. According to Berjawi, when he was eventually given some food, a porridge-like dish called “ugali,” the guards had sprinkled it with cigarette ash. He claimed they also asked him if he was gay and insinuated that they were going to send in a man who would rape him. Toward the end of the ordeal, Berjawi said that both he and Sakr endured several mock executions. “They just threw us out the car in the forest, and we heard ‘tchck-tchk’— you know, the noise was there, and then I’d feel a gun to the back of my head, like that, but &#8230; nothing. Then they’d just all laugh, pick us back up, throw us back into the car, then they’d drive again.

Together with Sakr, Berjawi was flown back to London accompanied by four Kenyan agents.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When the plane touched down, an announcement came over the speakers instructing all passengers to remain in their seats. A large group of “big white built men came on the plane with suits,&#8221; Berjawi later recounted. &#8220;One of them directly looked at me and smiled, and he called me, ‘Bilal, would you like to stand up?’”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The men ushered Berjawi and Sakr off the plane, at which point the friends were separated. The men told Berjawi they were from the British domestic security agency, MI5.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Over a period of about 10 hours, the agents interrogated him about his visit to Kenya and warned him he was not allowed to decline to answer their questions, suggesting he was detained under a British law, the \u003ca href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/schedule/7\">Terrorism Act\u003c/a>, which makes it a criminal offense to respond with “no comment.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The British agents snapped photographs of Berjawi and took his fingerprints. He recalled that they were apologetic, telling him, “We have to do this.” But he was left feeling aggrieved; after interrogating him, the agents took his money and shoes, handed him his clothes in a garbage bag, and left him alone in the airport, barefoot, without any means to return to his home in northwest London.\u003c/p>\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[5](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22none%22%7D) --\>\u003cblockquote class=\"stylized pull-none\" data-shortcode-type=\"pullquote\" data-pull=\"none\">\u003c!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[5] --\>A few weeks later, Berjawi called his uncle in Lebanon, who described receiving another visit from counterterrorism agents.

Rage said that Berjawi had been killed by a U.S. drone, and vowed revenge for the killing. He added: “We take his death as congratulation, thanks to Allah. &#8230; His martyrdom dream has just become true.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As news of Berjawi’s demise spread, it fueled paranoia within elements of al Qaeda in Somalia. Seven months prior to his death, al Qaeda’s chief in East Africa, Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, had also \u003ca href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/11/al-qaida-bomber-fazul-abdullah-mohammed-killed\">been killed\u003c/a>. Berjawi was said to have been close to Mohammed, and perhaps was his successor, so when he too died in a sudden attack there were suspicions that al Shabaab was carrying out some kind of clandestine coup.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Some news reports out of Kenya initially suggested the attack on Berjawi was an “\u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20121020083857/http://allafrica.com/stories/201201250052.html\">inside job\u003c/a>,” and that he had been assassinated due to a power struggle. \u003ca href=\"http://www.somaliareport.com/index.php/post/2749/Al_Qaeda_Al-Shaabab_Pledge_AllegianceAgain\">Subsequently\u003c/a>, one Somali outlet reported that at least 100 foreign al Qaeda fighters in Somalia had fled the country, partly due to leadership squabbles.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“It is true that those brothers left us and went to Yemen due to some minor internal misunderstandings amongst ourselves,” an al Shabaab spokesperson was quoted as saying at the time. “This started when we lost our brother, Bilal el-Berjawi, on January 21.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Once it became apparent that Berjawi had in fact been killed in a U.S. drone strike, the groups appear to have settled their differences and strengthened their alliance. Three weeks after Berjawi’s death, the leaders of both al Qaeda and al Shabaab appeared in a video together. Al Shabaab \u003ca href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/02/09/world/africa/somalia-shabaab-qaeda/\">pledged\u003c/a> its allegiance to al Qaeda and vowed that it would “march with you as loyal soldiers.”\u003c/p>\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(photo)[10](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PHOTO%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22RESOURCE%22%7D)(%7B%22scroll%22%3Afalse%2C%22align%22%3A%22none%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22auto%22%7D) --\>\u003cdiv class=\"img-wrap align-none  width-auto\" style=\"width: auto;\">\u003c!-- CONTENT(photo)[10] --\>\u003cimg class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-6529\" src=\"/wp-uploads/sites/1/2015/10/Testa.London.002-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"UK.

Relatives speculated that it was this phone call that had exposed him as a target for the drone strike. That seems unlikely, however. According to the timeline obtained by \u003cem>The Intercept, \u003c/em>Berjawi’s location had already been established by the covert special operations unit nine days prior to the lethal attack.

In a propaganda video, the alleged informants confessed to having hidden a cellphone in Berjawi’s vehicle so that he could be tracked and bombed. One of the accused informants, Isaac Omar Hassan, said a man working with the CIA in Mogadishu handed him a Nokia X2 cellphone and an envelope containing $4,000 cash.

If people are accused of wrongdoing they should be brought before a court and tried. That is what it means to live in a democracy that adheres to the rule of law.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Since 2006, the British government has reportedly \u003ca href=\"https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2014/12/10/what-do-we-know-about-citizenship-stripping/\">deprived\u003c/a> at least 27 people of their U.K. citizenship on national security grounds, deeming their presence “not conducive to the public good.” The power to revoke a person’s citizenship rests solely with a government minister, though the decision can be challenged through a controversial immigration court. When cases are brought on national security grounds, they are routinely based on secret evidence, meaning the accusations against individuals are withheld from them and their lawyers.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“The net effect of the practice,” according to Craig, is “not only to remove judicial oversight from a possible life and death decision, but also to close the doors of the court on anyone who seeks to expose some of the gravest abuses being committed by Western governments.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>There have \u003ca href=\"https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2015/09/07/raf-drone-strike-syria-deaths-means-at-least-10-britons-now-killed-by-drones-in-wests-war-on-terror/\">reportedly\u003c/a> been at least 10 British citizens killed in drone attacks as part of a covert campaign that, between 2008 and 2015, has gradually expanded from Pakistan to Somalia and now to Syria.
