                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Almost four years</u> after a federal judge <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2018/08/01/barry-jones-arizona-death-row-conviction-overturned/">overturned</a> Barry Jones’s 1995 conviction, the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated the order directing Arizona to release or retry Jones and reinstated his death sentence. The ruling puts Jones on a path to execution in a state that just restarted its death machinery — despite significant evidence that he is innocent.</p>
<p>The 6-3 <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-1009_19m2.pdf">decision</a> in Shinn v. Martinez Ramirez was authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote that Jones and David Martinez Ramirez, another man on Arizona’s death row, should not have been allowed to present new evidence in federal court showing that they had received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial. In Jones’s case, the evidence dismantled the state’s original theory of the crime, prompting U.S. District Judge Timothy Burgess to vacate his conviction. If not for the failures of Jones’s trial attorneys, Burgess wrote in 2018, jurors likely “would not have convicted him of <em>any</em> of the crimes with which he was charged and previously convicted.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>The Supreme Court’s May 23 ruling renders this evidence — and Burgess’s core findings, which were twice upheld by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals — moot. The majority agreed with Arizona’s contention that under the 1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, or AEDPA, which sharply <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2016/05/04/the-untold-story-of-bill-clintons-other-crime-bill/" target="_blank">limits</a> federal appeals, the hearing in Jones’s case should never have taken place. “In our dual-sovereign system, federal courts must afford unwavering respect” to trials in state court, Thomas wrote. Federal courts “lack the competence and authority to relitigate a state’s criminal case.”</p>
<p>The decision is a devastating blow to Jones, who has always insisted on his innocence. But it also slams the courthouse door on countless incarcerated people whose lawyers failed them at trial. “The court’s decision will leave many people who were convicted in violation of the Sixth Amendment to face incarceration or even execution without any meaningful chance to vindicate their right to counsel,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissent joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[1] -->
<p>Sotomayor described Thomas’s opinion as “perverse” and “illogical,” in part because it eviscerates the court’s own 2012 <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/10-1001" target="_blank">ruling</a> in Martinez v. Ryan, another case out of Arizona. That decision created a much-needed remedy for defendants who received poor representation both at trial and in state post-conviction proceedings. Under the stringent rules governing federal appeals, a defendant who fails to challenge their trial lawyer’s performance in state court is forbidden from bringing that evidence to federal court. But Martinez created an exception. It held that if the failure to develop such evidence in state court was due to a post-conviction lawyer’s own ineffectiveness, the defendant should be excused — and allowed to bring an ineffective assistance claim in federal court.</p>
<p>The ruling in Martinez v. Ryan was narrow. Limited to those with “substantial” claims of poor lawyering, which is difficult to prove, it offered a possible path to relief, not a guarantee. Still, it was a rare lifeline to people on death row, many of whom had been represented by lawyers who were overworked, underpaid, and often unqualified. Notably, the 7-2 majority in 2012 included Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, neither of whom raised concerns at the time over how the decision might be reconciled with AEDPA’s procedural hurdles.</p>
<p>Yet both justices joined Thomas, one of two dissenters in Martinez, in weaponizing AEDPA to gut the 10-year-old ruling — an emblem of the court’s newly aggressive indifference to its own legal precedent. Law professor Leah Litman, an expert on AEDPA and constitutional law, compared the decision to the leaked draft opinion in Dobbs v. Mississippi, which stands to <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/05/04/roe-abortion-supreme-court-samuel-alito/">overturn Roe v. Wade</a>. Both, she wrote in an <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/05/scotus-constitutional-right-habeas-corpus-prison-death-row.html">article for Slate</a>, make clear “that the court’s conservative supermajority is hellbent on smashing and grabbing precedent and constitutional rights no matter the consequences.”</p>

<h2>Perverse and Illogical</h2>
<p>Jones was sent to death row for the rape and murder of his girlfriend’s 4-year-old child, Rachel Gray. The child arrived at a Tucson hospital early in the morning on May 2, 1994, and was declared dead on arrival. An autopsy showed a blow to her abdomen, which ruptured her small intestine, developing into a fatal case of peritonitis. Investigators seized on Jones without considering how or when the child sustained the injury. At trial, prosecutors relied on circumstantial evidence and dubious forensic testimony to convince jurors that Jones had repeatedly assaulted Rachel the day before she died. His trial attorneys called no witnesses at the guilt phase aside from his 12-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>Jones’s case seemed like the perfect example of what the Martinez ruling was designed to address. Not only had his trial lawyers failed to investigate the medical evidence that provided the basis for his conviction, but his post-conviction attorney also failed to do the same. At Jones’s <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2018/02/09/arizona-death-row-barry-jones-evidentiary-hearing/">evidentiary hearing</a> in 2017, medical experts debunked the narrow timeframe during which the state claimed Jones had assaulted Rachel, showing that her fatal injury could not have developed so quickly. A slew of additional witnesses shed light on shocking investigative failures by the Pima County Sheriff’s Department.</p>
<p>But in Thomas’s view, this hearing was nothing more than an “improper burden imposed on the states” by the Martinez decision. The “sprawling” seven-day hearing “included testimony from no fewer than 10 witnesses, including defense trial counsel, defense post-conviction counsel, the lead investigating detective, three forensic pathologists,” and more, he wrote. The hearing covered “virtually every disputed issue in the case, including the timing of Rachel Gray’s injuries and her cause of death. This wholesale relitigation of Jones’ guilt is plainly not what Martinez envisioned.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22left%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-left" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="left"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[3] -->Jones’s case seemed like the perfect example of what the Martinez ruling was designed to address.<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[3] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[3] -->
<p>In her dissent, Sotomayor pointed out what should have been obvious to the court that handed down the Martinez ruling just a decade ago: Such a thorough hearing “was necessary only because trial counsel failed to present any of that evidence during the guilt phase of Jones’ capital case,” she wrote. “The District Court’s hearing was wide-ranging precisely because the breakdown of the adversarial system in Jones’ case was so egregious.”</p>
<p>The notion that Jones’s hearing was a misapplication of Martinez only really made sense to those who believed that the ruling should be a remedy on paper alone. This had been at the heart of Arizona’s argument for years; prosecutors insisted that even if Martinez allowed Jones to use new evidence to bring forth a claim that his trial lawyers had been ineffective, he was not actually allowed to use that evidence to prove it.</p>
<p>The confusion over such logic was on display at the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/08/13/arizona-death-penalty/" target="_blank">oral argument</a> in Jones’s case before a 9th Circuit panel in 2019, during which the judges seemed stupefied. When they asked why a judge would allow a claim to be brought if they couldn’t consider the evidence, Arizona Assistant Attorney General Myles Braccio replied that a judge could just look to the state court record. “But that doesn’t make sense if the claim wasn’t developed in state court,” one judge replied. Another called it a “Catch-22.”</p>
<p>At the Supreme Court argument in December, the conservative justices clearly grasped the problem. Thomas kicked off the questions. Why give a defendant the chance to bring a previously barred claim of ineffective assistance of counsel only to forbid them from presenting the evidence to support it? he asked. “It seems pretty worthless.” Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted that in Martinez, the court “obviously carefully crafted an opinion to give you the right to raise an ineffective assistance claim, to make sure it’s considered at least once, and this would really gut that in a lot of cases.”</p>
<p>In the end, this is precisely what the justices decided to do. “While we agree that any such … hearing would serve no purpose,” Thomas wrote, “that is a reason to dispense with Martinez hearings altogether.” In a nod to Arizona’s <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/12/30/barry-jones-arizona-supreme-court/">repeated contention</a> at oral argument that “innocence isn’t enough” for Jones to prevail in this case, Thomas cited the court’s decision in Herrera v. Collins, which famously held that there was no constitutional prohibition against executing someone for a crime they did not commit. In a case like Jones’s, he wrote, federal intervention is “an affront to the state and its citizens who returned a verdict of guilt after considering the evidence before them.”</p>
<h2>A Lot at Stake</h2>
<p>I first <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2017/10/23/barry-jones-arizona-death-row-rachel-gray/">wrote</a> about Barry Jones in 2017, in advance of the evidentiary hearing in Tucson. At that time, there was no reason to suspect that Martinez was in peril. In fact, the Supreme Court had extended the ruling to apply to defendants in Texas and other states whose appellate procedures differed from Arizona’s. Although lawyers for incarcerated people were working hard to use Martinez to win relief for their clients, few had effectively availed themselves of the decision.</p>

<p>Jones was about to be an exception. In the years since his 1995 trial, the central evidence against him had largely fallen apart. Even the pathologist who conducted Rachel’s autopsy and took the stand against Jones at trial, Dr. John Howard, seemed to acknowledge that his testimony had been misleading. At the trial of Jones’s girlfriend, Angela Gray, who was sentenced to eight years in prison for her failure to take her daughter to the hospital the night before she died, Howard estimated that Rachel’s fatal intestinal wound was “most consistent” with occurring 24 hours or longer before her death. Yet at Jones’s subsequent trial, Howard said the injury was consistent with being inflicted 12 hours before Rachel’s estimated time of death — precisely the window the state used to implicate Jones.</p>
<p>Jones’s lead trial attorney, Sean Bruner, failed to confront Howard with the discrepancy. “I could have cross-examined him on that 24-hour/12-hour thing, and I missed that,” Bruner <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2017/10/23/barry-jones-arizona-death-row-rachel-gray/">told me</a> in 2017. For his own part, Howard explained in an affidavit that he only answered the questions he was asked on the stand. If trial attorneys had asked whether Rachel’s abdominal injury could have happened “more than 24 hours before her death, I would have answered the question in the affirmative.”</p>

<p>Burgess, the judge, seemed disturbed by Howard’s willingness to change his opinions from one moment to the next. “You understand that in these trials there was a lot at stake, right?” he asked at the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2018/02/09/arizona-death-row-barry-jones-evidentiary-hearing/">2017 hearing</a>. Yet Howard continued to shift his analysis on the stand, saying that the abdominal injury could have taken place “a few hours, typical of a day or the same day as death,” while adding that “it could be just a few hours, it could be 24 hours, it could potentially, or at least in theory, be longer.”</p>
<p>The evidence that Jones had raped Rachel also failed to stand up to scrutiny. Although Howard said that injuries to the child’s vagina had been inflicted at the same time as her abdominal trauma, experts who reviewed the case for Jones’s federal defenders flatly disputed this. Dr. Janice Ophoven, a renowned pediatric pathologist, testified that the injury was likely “weeks old.” Another pathologist said that he would not even put it in the same context as the abdominal injury: “It’s not in the death timeline.”</p>

<p>The vaginal injury was key to law enforcement’s original suspicion of Jones. He had been the one to drop off Rachel and her mother at the hospital, where Pima County Sheriff’s Detective Sonia Pesqueira examined the child herself, finding her covered in bruises, with blood in her underwear. Later that morning, before an autopsy had been conducted, Pesqueira aggressively interrogated Jones, accusing him of killing Rachel and falsely claiming that his own daughter had accused him of hurting the child. Yet she neglected to collect key evidence that could have connected the child’s injuries to the perpetrator, such as the clothes she was wearing the previous day. When part of a pair of underwear was tested for DNA years later, there was nothing that matched Jones.</p>

<p>At the evidentiary hearing, prosecutors insisted that Pesqueira had “followed the evidence of guilt for Rachel’s injuries, and that road led directly to Jones.” Besides, they said, her investigation was irrelevant since the hearing was limited only to the question of whether Jones’s defense attorneys had been ineffective. “Law enforcement has nothing to do with this case,” Braccio said.</p>
<p>But Burgess disagreed. “The evidentiary hearing in this case has demonstrated that the police investigation was colored by a rush to judgment and a lack of due diligence,” he wrote. “Effective counsel would have brought this to the jury’s attention.” For example, there were numerous alternate suspects at the Desert Vista Trailer Park in Tucson where Gray and Jones lived. Pesqueira had no answer for why she neglected to investigate any of them — or why she ignored evidence that Gray herself had physically abused her children.</p>
<p>But the most important witnesses were the experts who showed that Rachel’s fatal injury could never have led to her death so quickly. One was an independent pathologist who agreed back in 1994 to study the microscopic slides from Rachel’s autopsy but never received the materials from Jones’s trial attorneys. “Rachel’s small bowel laceration was not inflicted on May 1, 1994,” he wrote in a 2017 affidavit, and “Jones’s jury was misled to believe otherwise.” Another doctor testified that there were “no reported cases in medical literature in which this type of injury has resulted in death in less than 48 hours.”</p>
<p>Ophoven, the pediatric pathologist, pointed to the physical evidence as well as Rachel’s symptoms to show how the injury to Rachel’s small intestine had become deadly over time. Whatever caused the injury, Ophoven said, the subsequent inflammation typically associated with such abdominal trauma had spread slowly to her abdominal cavity, making it harder to detect. One neighbor had told investigators that Rachel looked gray and unwell on April 30 — two days before her death, which was an important clue. “The gray color is kind of specific to this kind of process,” Ophoven testified. Yet Pesqueira admitted that she dismissed the statement at the time. “I thought she was giving me the wrong day,” she testified.</p>
<p>In his 91-page <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4636294-Barry-Jones-Order-07-31-18.html">order</a>, Burgess wrote that such testimony could well have convinced a jury not to convict Jones of murder. His lawyers’ investigative failures “pervaded the entire evidentiary picture presented at trial.” But today, as far as the Supreme Court is concerned, this partial and distorted picture is the only one that matters. The evidence presented at the hearing has been completely swept away.</p>
<h2>Killing an Innocent Man</h2>
<p>On the day after the Supreme Court’s ruling, Jones’s longtime attorney, Arizona Assistant Federal Defender Cary Sandman, was still grappling with what had happened. Although he’d swiftly assembled his legal team to discuss next steps, it would take another day for him to bring himself to read the decision. At 70, Sandman had hoped to welcome Jones to the outside world as one of the final capstones to a long legal career. Instead, he went to see Jones at the Arizona penitentiary where he remains with no clear way out.</p>
<p>The court’s decision fulfilled Sandman’s worst fears. “There was no reason to take that case unless they were gonna basically neuter Martinez,” he said. After the oral argument in December, Sandman echoed what legal observers were saying: The justices had asked all the right questions. But in the end, this only made the ruling more cruel. “The majority’s Kafkaesque decision will condemn many to wrongful imprisonment, or worse, death,” Sandman said. “All in the name of state’s rights.”</p>

<p>For attorney Bob Loeb, who argued for Jones before the court, Thomas’s one-paragraph summary of the facts in the case was <a href="https://twitter.com/BobLoeb/status/1528804201706491904" target="_blank">infuriating</a> to read. “On May 1, 1994, Barry Lee Jones repeatedly beat his girlfriend’s 4-year-old daughter,” it began. Never mind that this time frame and the medical claims it relied on had been repeatedly debunked. In a statement, Loeb <a href="https://twitter.com/BobLoeb/status/1528753737266864130" target="_blank">wrote</a> that the decision was “tragic for Barry Jones, who remains in prison notwithstanding evidence which the district court determined undercut the murder charge against him — evidence showing that the conviction was based on assertions that were scientifically untrue.”</p>
<p>If there is any hope for Jones going forward, it could lie with the office that sent him to death row in the first place. In the years I&#8217;ve reported on Jones’s case, the Pima County Attorney’s Office, which is home to a <a href="https://www.pcao.pima.gov/pcao-divisions/conviction-integrity-unit/" target="_blank">Conviction and Sentencing Integrity Unit</a>, has repeatedly sidestepped inquiries as to when the office might reinvestigate the conviction. In an email last year, the head of the unit, Jack Chin, wrote that while his office “has a general policy against the death penalty, and all capital sentences which are in our jurisdiction and responsibility will be looked at closely and carefully,” he had “not spent a great deal of time” looking at Jones’s case.</p>
<p>But after the Supreme Court’s ruling, Chin wrote that the CSIU had no plans to revisit the case. “I have checked into it, and under current protocol, the AG’s office will handle further proceedings, not PCAO, so I do not expect that I or anyone else in this office will be involved.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, Jones is starting to see neighbors marched to the execution chamber. After an eight-year hiatus on executions, the state <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/witnesses-report-problems-inserting-iv-in-arizonas-first-execution-in-eight-years" target="_blank">killed</a> 66-year-old Clarence Dixon by lethal injection earlier this month, struggling for 25 minutes to find a vein. Next month Arizona plans to execute another man convicted in Tucson who <a href="https://azcapitalproject.org/2022/05/25/atwood-execution-for-media/" target="_blank">insists</a> upon his innocence. In an email shared by Sandman, Jones wrote that he was “still processing the news” about the Supreme Court’s ruling. “Putting on a brave face, but underneath I am as scared as I have ever been,” he wrote. “If they can put me back on death row, and they did, then there ain’t a doubt in my mind that they could justify killing an innocent man.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>A few hours</u> after a judge authorized Claude Garrett’s release from prison, the small crowd outside Riverbend Maximum Security Institution in Nashville, Tennessee, got a message to their group text. It came from Garrett’s daughter, Deana Watson. Garrett was packed and ready to go, but there was paperwork to be done downtown. She typed a version of an update she herself had received countless times over the years: “Still waiting.”</p>
<p>It was just after noon on May 10. Davidson County Criminal Court Judge Monte Watkins had vacated Garrett’s conviction the previous Friday. Someone speculated that the person with the paperwork must have gone on their lunch break. Another person joked that it was being transported via carrier pigeon. But nobody was really complaining. “It’s over and the best is yet to come,” someone wrote in the group text.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[0] -->
<p>Garrett was used to waiting. It had taken about 28 years, after all, for the Davidson County District Attorney’s Office to make the decision to <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/02/29/claude-garrett-arson-junk-science-updates/" target="_blank">reinvestigate</a> his case. When the DA’s Conviction Review Unit finally agreed with what Garrett had insisted all along — that he’d been wrongfully convicted of setting the fire that killed his girlfriend in 1992 — there was another round of waiting: first for an <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/04/16/fire-arson-claude-garrett-hearing/" target="_blank">evidentiary hearing</a> in which fire scientists explained why the case against Garrett had been fatally flawed, and finally for the judge to sign the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/05/07/claude-garrett-murder-arson-conviction-overturned/" target="_blank">order</a> vacating his conviction.</p>
<p>Earlier that day Garrett had been transported downtown for one last court appearance, where Sunny Eaton, the director of the Conviction Review Unit, announced that the DA was dropping the charges against him. Garrett’s friends and family expected him to walk out of court, but they were told by his lawyers that he would be taken back to Riverbend first. The maximum-security prison sits less than 20 minutes from downtown Nashville, near a small airport on a mostly industrial stretch of road. Unsure when he might be released, a small group gathered first at a nearby gas station, then at a spot just outside the prison’s entrance.</p>

<p>In a baseball cap and sunglasses, Denny Griswold held a black umbrella over his wife to protect her from the sun. Griswold had met Garrett through the prison outreach ministry at his church 14 years earlier. Over time he had become a mentor to Garrett — and a firm believer in his innocence. Griswold came to court that morning with a change of clothes for him. Garrett had not asked for anything in particular. “He’ll look like an average old man,” Griswold said, smiling.</p>
<p>A few feet away, veteran fire investigator Stuart Bayne stood quietly, holding a book he’d been waiting to give to Garrett, which he’d asked everyone to inscribe. It was a <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/606648/when-truth-is-all-you-have-by-jim-mccloskey-with-philip-lerman/">memoir</a> by the founder of a nonprofit organization that advocates for the wrongfully convicted. The title was enough to move Bayne to tears: “When the Truth Is All You Have.” From the moment he first studied the evidence as an expert witness for Garrett’s 2003 retrial, Bayne had been consumed by what was clearly a miscarriage of justice. For years he had been one of Garrett’s sole advocates; it was only relatively recently that a wave of leading fire scientists joined the cause.</p>
<p>In phone calls with Garrett, Bayne occasionally joked about showing up with champagne in the parking lot on the day of his release. Garrett reminded him that was contraband. But now Bayne was more contemplative than celebratory. At one point, Watson sent a photo of a large plastic box truck containing piles of paperwork her dad was taking home with him. “Wow,” Bayne said quietly. “That represents 30 years of his life. He kept everything. All our letters, all his appeals, all the stuff I’ve sent him. My goodness.”</p>
<p>It was just after 1:30 p.m. when Watson’s black SUV finally made its way down the hill from the prison. Seconds later, Garrett emerged from the passenger’s seat. “Who do I hug first?” he asked. A TV camera followed Bayne as he strode toward the car. Garrett approached the man who had been fighting to help him clear his name for more than 20 years. They shook hands and then broke into a hug. “Welcome to the free world,” Bayne said.</p>

<h2>A World Transformed</h2>
<p>Garrett’s release was the culmination of a long legal fight whose outcome would have been hard to foresee just a few years ago. In the decades he spent insisting upon his innocence, Garrett never fathomed that the same office that sent him to prison for life would eventually advocate for his release. Yet the statement from Eaton was clear: “Following an extensive collaborative investigation between the Nashville District Attorney’s Conviction Review Unit and the Tennessee Innocence Project, Claude Garrett has been exonerated for the wrongful conviction of the murder of Lorie Lance.”</p>
<p>Garrett was twice convicted of setting the fire that killed 24-year-old Lance in the small home they shared in Old Hickory, Tennessee. The couple had returned from a local bar in the early morning hours of February 24, 1992, when Garrett said he awoke to find a fire in the living room. According to Garrett, he woke up Lance and ran with her toward the front door, only for Lance to turn and run toward the rear of the house. Firefighters later found her in a utility room, dead from smoke inhalation.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A4%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="4"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[3] -->
<p>Although neighbors initially described Garrett as frantic, investigators became suspicious upon smelling kerosene at the scene. The lead investigator, James Cooper — a special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives — seized on a so-called pour pattern on the living room floor as proof that an ignitable liquid had been used to start the fire. Perhaps most critically — and despite evidence to the contrary — Cooper also concluded that the utility room had been locked from the outside, trapping Lance.</p>
<p>Garrett’s case is one of countless convictions across the U.S. based on forensic evidence that has since been debunked. In the decades following Lance’s death, new developments in fire science transformed the techniques used to determine whether a fire was arson. But even as investigators have discarded the myths they once relied on in favor of the scientific method, prosecutors have been slow to revisit old convictions. This problem spans well beyond arson cases. Many DA’s offices continue to fight to preserve convictions even when the underlying evidence has been exposed as junk science.</p>
<p>Today the Davidson County DA’s office is an exception to that rule. Since Eaton took charge of the Conviction Review Unit in 2020, the office has ramped up its work. Last year it exonerated a Nashville couple accused of raping and murdering a 4-year-old child in 1987. That conviction was based on the faulty analysis of a medical examiner who also played a key role in Garrett’s conviction.</p>
<p>The decision to reinvestigate Garrett’s case was prompted largely by The Intercept’s <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/series/playing-with-fire/">coverage</a>, dating back to 2015. Although a number of fire experts had concluded by then that the conviction was based on junk science, the first in-depth <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2015/02/24/junkscienceclaudegarrett/">story</a> revisiting the case attracted an additional cohort of fire scientists, who studied the evidence and released new reports debunking the state’s arson theory. While the courts initially dismissed this new evidence, a follow-up story in 2018 caught the attention of the DA’s office, which had recently launched the Conviction Review Unit.</p>
<p>Standing outside the prison after his release, Garrett thanked The Intercept and all who had drawn attention to his wrongful conviction. It was only recently that he had even allowed himself to think about a future beyond prison walls. For years, Bayne said, Garrett would say, “It’s too early to think about this. … It’s too early to plan these things. … I just gotta get the door open.” Now Garrett wanted to focus on making up for lost time with his daughter. Watson was only 4 years old when Garrett went to prison. She now had a son that same age. That afternoon Garrett spoke to his grandson via FaceTime — “one of the best parts of the day.”</p>
<p>Later that evening, Garrett sat next to Watson at a restaurant just north of downtown Nashville. He’d changed out of his prison blues and into the clothes Griswold gave him: a gray collared shirt and dark blue jeans. As Watson ordered appetizers, Garrett sampled a little bit of everything — truffle fries, crab-stuffed mushrooms — but declined an entrée. He was trying to pace himself, he explained. After leaving prison earlier that day, they had stopped for food at Chick-fil-A, where he’d gotten a sandwich. “I’ve still got half of it,” he said.</p>
<p>There was so much to navigate. Some things he had long anticipated, like learning to use a cellphone. But he hadn’t realized that everybody would be looking at their phones all the time. Then there were the things other people took for granted. At Griswold’s house earlier that day, where he spent his first few hours of freedom, there was a bowl of berries in the kitchen. He realized that he hadn’t seen a strawberry in 30 years.</p>
<p>One of the most overwhelming things was seeing the city of Nashville itself. In the decades he’d been in prison, the city had completely transformed. Garrett remembered a trip downtown for a hearing in the late 1990s. Turning off the highway toward the courthouse, “You could see all of downtown,” he said. “It occurred to me right then … ‘All of that is against you.’” Coming to the restaurant that evening, he realized that he was in the same spot, although one of the street names had changed. “I looked at it again, and I’m like, what the hell happened?”</p>
<p>Other changes were more painful. Garrett counted the number of friends and family who had died in the decades he’d been gone. It was more than 50 people. Among the few plans he had made was going to Kansas to visit his mother’s grave. Otherwise, he said, “I’m not gonna try to plan much. I’m gonna let it unfold as it goes.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Three decades after</u> Claude Garrett was accused of committing arson to kill his girlfriend, Lorie Lance, a Tennessee judge vacated his conviction, finding him innocent of murder and opening the door to his release. In an <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21906324-order-vacating-claude-garrett-conviction">order</a> signed on May 6, Davidson County Criminal Court Judge Monte Watkins found that Garrett had made a “clear and convincing” case that if jurors had been aware of new scientific evidence at the time of his trial, they would never have convicted him of setting the 1992 fire that sent him to prison for life.</p>
<p>The order comes one month after an <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/04/16/fire-arson-claude-garrett-hearing/">evidentiary hearing</a> in Nashville in which leading fire experts testified that the case against Garrett was based on a rush to judgment, a shoddy investigation, and junk science. The hearing followed a reinvestigation of the case by the Davidson County District Attorney’s Office — spurred by The Intercept’s <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/series/playing-with-fire/">reporting</a> — which <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/11/24/claude-garrett-murder-wrongful-conviction/" target="_blank">concluded</a> last year that it could no longer stand by its conviction. Lawyers from both the <a href="https://www.tninnocence.org/" target="_blank">Tennessee Innocence Project</a> and the DA’s Conviction Review Unit subsequently asked Watkins to vacate the conviction in light of new scientific evidence that dismantled the state’s original theory of the crime. “If the state had been armed with the information that we now have,” Conviction Review Unit Director Sunny Eaton told the judge, “we would not have indicted this case.”</p>

<p>Garrett, 65, has always insisted on his innocence. As he describes it, he woke up in the small home he shared with Lance on February 24, 1992, to a fire in the living room, then tried to escape with Lance. But rather than follow him out the front door, he said, she turned to the back of the house, where she was later found dead from smoke inhalation. Investigators became suspicious upon arriving at the home; they smelled kerosene, which the couple used to heat the house, and found a large, irregularly shaped burn pattern on the living room floor. At that time, fire investigators labeled such evidence “pour patterns,” believing them to be proof that a liquid accelerant had been used to start a fire. Today such indicators have been widely discredited as myths.</p>

<p>Prosecutors tried Garrett twice, arguing that he had locked Lance in a utility room in the back of the house and then used kerosene to start the fire. But the evidence was shaky at best. After Garrett uncovered a police report that had been concealed from his defense attorney at trial — which indicated that the utility room door had been unlocked — a court overturned his conviction. By the time prosecutors tried Garrett again in 2003, scientific advancements in understanding fire behavior should have discredited the central evidence against him. But the state’s star witness, veteran Special Agent James Cooper of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, insisted that he could tell through his visual observations alone that the fire was arson. The second jury also found Garrett guilty.</p>
<p>At the hearing in Nashville last month, fire experts made clear that Cooper’s claims were divorced from science and that the investigation into the alleged arson had failed to adhere even to the loose standards in place in 1992. Particularly egregious was the failure to preserve or even examine the door and latch that had supposedly trapped Lance in the utility room. Smoke deposits could have provided critical evidence to show the position of the door, the expert witnesses explained. Instead, Cooper had dismissed such vital evidence. In his order vacating Garrett’s conviction, Watkins noted that “every expert applying modern standards concludes that the latch was unlocked.”</p>

<p>At the heart of the judge’s order was what experts described as a “paradigm shift” between 1992 and modern-day fire investigation. Today’s fire investigators are trained to follow the scientific method in determining the origin and cause of a fire, gathering evidence to test a hypothesis before drawing any conclusions about whether a fire was arson.</p>
<p>Watkins was persuaded by expert testimony showing that “although the field had taken significant strides toward accepting the scientific method by the time of Garrett’s retrial in 2003,” Cooper had insisted upon discredited methodology, using the term “pour pattern” 34 times on the stand. What’s more, in the nearly 20 years since the retrial, additional research on fire behavior has continued to debunk the evidence used to convict Garrett. “Jurors at Mr. Garrett’s 2003 trial were not informed about any of these developments,” the judge wrote.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Watkins granted both claims brought by Garrett’s attorneys, both based on new scientific evidence: “a freestanding claim of actual innocence” and a claim that Garrett’s due process rights were violated under the Tennessee and federal constitutions. On the latter, Watkins found that Cooper’s expert testimony regarding the origin of the fire — the “pillar of proof” against Garrett — was “highly prejudicial.”</p>
<p>“To view any of the evidence as inculpatory requires speculation or rejection of scientific fact,” the judge wrote.</p>
<p>The finding of actual innocence, meanwhile, carries particular meaning for Garrett. Unlike an exoneration through DNA, in which scientific evidence reveals the real perpetrator of a crime, the failed investigation and destruction of evidence in 1992 means that the true source of the fire will remain unsolved. Although the Conviction Review Unit was unable to “uncover affirmative evidence conclusively establishing Garrett’s innocence,” Eaton wrote last fall, the case against Garrett was “nonexistent.” Watkins agreed. He found that the evidence supported an accidental fire scenario, even if the cause remained undetermined. If Garrett were tried today, the state “would have no reliable proof of guilt.”</p>
<p>For Garrett’s most dedicated advocate, veteran fire investigator Stuart Bayne, the order was a final step toward correcting a profound injustice. When he received the news Friday afternoon, Bayne called the prison chaplain at Riverbend Maximum Security Institution. Shortly afterward, the phone rang. When Bayne heard Garrett’s voice on the other line, he was singing from the Barry Manilow song “It’s a Miracle”: “Looks like we made it.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>When the news</u> broke, the small crowd gathered outside the governor’s public reception room at the Texas Capitol erupted with cheers: The state’s Court of Criminal Appeals had stayed Melissa Lucio’s impending execution. It was sending her case back to district court to consider several pressing claims, including that Lucio was innocent in the 2007 death of her 2-year-old daughter, Mariah.</p>
<p>Maggie Luna was beaming from ear to ear, and Jennifer Toon had tears in her eyes. The two women — friends and formerly incarcerated activists — had joined a broad coalition of supporters pressing every lever they could think of to try to stop the execution, scheduled for April 27. Neither woman had been eating very much. Or sleeping well.</p>
<p>Toon had been the inmate librarian at the Mountain View prison unit where Texas’s female death row prisoners are housed, and she’d gotten to know Lucio over the years. Lucio was kind and gentle; Toon couldn’t imagine that she was capable of killing anyone, let alone her own daughter. “Melissa Lucio was the epitome of every system in the state of Texas failing at every level: education, health, faith community,” she said. “And certainly, the court system.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A3%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="3"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[0] -->
<p>According to the state, Lucio, then a mother of 12 who struggled with drug addiction, had beaten her toddler to death in February 2007. Mariah’s lifeless body arrived at a hospital in Harlingen, Texas, covered in bruises, which authorities immediately assumed were evidence of abuse. But although Lucio had a history of being investigated by Child Protective Services, she had no history of physically abusing her kids. She tried to explain to no avail that Mariah had fallen down the stairs a few days earlier; the possibility that the child’s death was not murder but the result of a tragic accident was never investigated. Instead, police subjected Lucio to a punishing late-night interrogation lasting more than five hours. After repeatedly denying that she killed her daughter, Lucio finally conceded that she was responsible. In 2008, Lucio was convicted and sentenced to die.</p>
<p>After Toon was released from prison, she remained in touch with Lucio. While bouncing around online, Toon came across the documentary “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN2cGWGO984">The State of Texas v. Melissa</a>,” which confirmed her instincts that Lucio was innocent. She prodded Luna, then her roommate, to watch the movie. Lucio’s story resonated with Luna; a mom of three, Luna had struggled with drug addiction, lost her children to the state’s child welfare system, and gone to prison. She could see herself in Lucio’s story. “This could’ve been me,” she said. “This is terrifying — it should be terrifying for everybody.”</p>
<p>Toon wondered why Lucio’s story wasn’t getting as much attention as the cases of some of the men on Texas’s death row. “We felt like David and Goliath,” she said, as she and Luna did what they could to push Lucio’s case into the spotlight. Ultimately, the two women hooked up with Abraham Bonowitz, executive director of <a href="https://deathpenaltyaction.org/">Death Penalty Action</a>, who had organized a campaign around Lucio&#8217;s case across Texas and beyond. That’s what brought Luna and Toon to the Capitol on April 25.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->
<p>There were two possible avenues of relief for Lucio. Her legal team, including attorneys from the federal public defender office in Austin and the Innocence Project, had filed a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lo-RsjAX-FXMZ9ucxvN4zUjmcdcaAe0Q/view">clemency petition</a> with the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, asking them to recommend that Gov. Greg Abbott commute Lucio’s sentence, or at least grant a 120-day reprieve from execution. They’d also <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cf5pWQL27NQCiC-oDtyuXJi-RnSFl8Qz/view">filed</a> a petition with the Court of Criminal Appeals, arguing that new evidence undermined Lucio’s conviction. The lawyers asked the court to block the execution and send the case back to the lower court for further scrutiny — and ultimately, a new trial.</p>
<p>By Monday morning, there was a fair amount of speculation spreading among activists about what would happen; word was that the board had already made its decision and would make its announcement by early afternoon. Instead, just before 1 p.m., Bonowitz’s phone rang. It was Lucio’s son John, calling to say that the<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F-6CidutQgm26gGYaXar8XZfYlvfKvSw/view"> court had intervened</a>.</p>
<p>“It’s not over by a long shot; this campaign has to continue,” Bonowitz told a smattering of TV reporters. “But for us, what’s clear is that there’s a recognition by the court that something is wrong and needs to be fixed.”</p>
<p>Shortly after the court delivered the stay, state Rep. Jeff Leach called Lucio. Have you heard the news? he asked. She hadn’t.</p>
<p>“Are you serious!? Are you serious!?” <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/04/25/melissa-lucio-execution-reprieve/">she exclaimed through tears</a>. “That is wonderful. Oh my God. What does that mean?”</p>
<p>“Well, it means you’re going to wake up on Thursday morning,” Leach replied.</p>

<h2>Error Compounding Error</h2>
<p>It was fitting that Leach would deliver the news. The conservative Republican from North Texas became an unlikely ally of the condemned mother from the Rio Grande Valley. Leach, a co-chair of the House Criminal Justice Reform Caucus, worked with Democratic Rep. Joe Moody to muster an unprecedented level of support for Lucio among an ideologically diverse group of more than 80 state representatives — more than half of the members of the Texas House, a body that rarely comes to a decisive consensus about anything.</p>
<p>Over the last month, Leach, a self-professed supporter of capital punishment, became increasingly vocal about his concerns, vowing to do “everything I can … in every way possible” to prevent Lucio’s execution. Leach and a handful of colleagues traveled to visit Lucio in prison. He and Moody also convened a committee hearing to question Cameron County District Attorney Luis Saenz, who had requested Lucio’s execution date. They implored him to step up and withdraw it.</p>
<p>“To say I’m wrestling with the very existence of the death penalty in Texas would be a dramatic understatement,” <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/tx/south-texas-el-paso/news/2022/04/08/texas-lawmakers-visit-woman-on-death-row-with-hugs--prayers">Leach said</a>.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[3] -->
<p>The fact that Lucio was granted a stay at all is also relatively unusual; the Court of Criminal Appeals rarely sticks its neck out to pause the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/02/09/death-penalty-texas-maurice-chammah-let-the-lord-sort-them/">state’s machinery of death</a>. Over the years, it has routinely allowed executions to go forward even in cases where there were <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2017/09/25/texas-dna-testing-larry-swearingen-execution/">serious questions</a> about a defendant’s guilt. In fact, the court had twice <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F-6CidutQgm26gGYaXar8XZfYlvfKvSw/view">ruled against</a> Lucio’s appeals. But it seems the relentless pressure from activists and lawmakers, combined with the mounting evidence of Lucio’s innocence, was too much to simply ignore.</p>
<p>The court’s order sends the case back to Cameron County, where the trial court will be tasked with considering evidence on four claims that cut to the heart of the state’s case against Lucio. Specifically, the question is whether false testimony, faulty forensic practices, and hidden evidence tainted her conviction.</p>
<p>Lucio’s lawyers argue that Dr. Norma Farley, the forensic pathologist who autopsied Mariah, misled the jury when she insisted that Mariah’s injuries could only have resulted from a fatal beating. As The Intercept <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/03/05/melissa-lucio-texas-death-penalty/">has previously reported</a>, Farley was unequivocal in testifying that she knew right away that Mariah had been murdered. “This child had more bruises than I’ve ever seen in any case that I had before,” she said. “This is a beating.” Medical experts who reviewed Lucio’s case now say that Mariah’s injuries were entirely consistent with a fall down the stairs, and that Farley failed to rule out that possibility before jumping to her inflammatory conclusion.</p>
<p>The lawyers also argue that Farley deployed junk science, including testimony about an <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/04/17/melissa-lucio-clemency-execution/">alleged bite mark</a> on Mariah’s back, to bolster her insistence that Mariah had been abused. And they say that Lucio’s interrogators — a phalanx of investigators that included Texas Ranger Victor Escalon — engaged in their own junk science. From the moment he walked into the interview room, Escalon testified, he knew that Lucio “had done something.” The notion that a person can determine another’s guilt or deception through their body language has been <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/08/12/blueleaks-law-enforcement-police-lie-detection/">roundly discredited</a>.</p>
<p>The lawyers also claim that the DA’s office illegally withheld from Lucio’s trial counsel crucial documents generated by the state’s child welfare agency. Those documents, her lawyers argue, support Lucio’s claim that Mariah’s health had deteriorated after falling down the stairs. The idea that the office might’ve engaged in legal trickery to invigorate their case against Lucio is hardly surprising; then-District Attorney Armando Villalobos was trying to rehabilitate his reelection campaign amid allegations of corruption, and he was up against a challenger who had taken him to task for failing to prosecute child abuse cases. In 2014, Villalobos was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdtx/pr/former-cameron-county-district-attorney-armando-villalobos-sentenced-federal-prison">sentenced</a> to 13 years in federal prison for racketeering and extortion.</p>
<p>The trial court will also be asked to consider the claim that Lucio is innocent of murder. Her lawyers argue that credible science demonstrates that Mariah’s death was caused by an accident and that Lucio was sentenced to death for a crime that never happened.</p>
<p>“Error compounded error,” the lawyers wrote in their petition to the Court of Criminal Appeals. “The biased investigation supported a prosecution — led by a criminally corrupt prosecutor — centered on an unreliable, contaminated ‘confession’ and false scientific evidence that misled and inflamed the jury. Viewing all of the available evidence … no rational juror would have found Ms. Lucio guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.”</p>
<p>In a phone call on Monday, Johnny Galvan, one of several jurors who supported Lucio’s clemency petition, expressed relief upon hearing that the court had stayed Lucio’s execution. “This makes my day,” he said.</p>

<h2>Lingering Questions</h2>
<p>Lucio’s son John was in Gatesville, Texas, on Monday afternoon, preparing for a visit with his mother at the nearby Mountain View unit. It was potentially one of the last times he would see her alive. He was accompanied by family members as well as Sabrina Van Tassel, the director of “The State of Texas v. Melissa,” who had traveled from Paris to witness Lucio’s execution. John and his wife, Michelle, were filming an interview with <a href="https://twitter.com/NidiaCavazosTV/status/1518668880197128192" target="_blank">Univision</a> in their hotel lobby when John stepped away to take a phone call from Assistant Federal Public Defender Tivon Schardl. Moments later, he interrupted the interview. “Babe,” he said to Michelle, his voice filled with emotion. “My mom got a stay.”</p>
<p>After sobs and hugs in the lobby, the family raced to see Lucio. “As fast as my heart was pacing, that’s how fast I was driving,” John later <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FreeMelissaLucio/videos/304832161807336" target="_blank">told</a> reporters at a press conference. Michelle described the moment they saw Lucio inside the visitation area. “We put our hands up to the glass, and we all began to cry.”</p>
<p>The press conference was still underway when Saenz, the Cameron County district attorney, released a statement responding to the stay of execution: “I welcome the opportunity to prosecute this case in the courtroom, where witnesses testify under oath, where witnesses can be cross-examined, where evidence is governed by the rules of evidence and criminal procedure, and where the court rules pursuant to the rule of law,” it read. “That is our criminal jurisprudence system and it is working.”</p>
<p>The notion that Saenz would be eager to retry Lucio rather than drop the charges offended Death Penalty Action activist Charles Keith, who spent the past several months traveling to the Cameron County courthouse in Brownsville. Keith knew all too well what Lucio’s loved ones had just been through: His own brother, Kevin Keith, came less than two weeks from execution in Ohio despite doubts over his guilt. Speaking at the press conference, Keith responded to Saenz’s statement. “What evidence would you have? I’m hoping it’s not the same evidence Mr. Villalobos had. … If you’re gonna bring it, bring it right. And if he didn’t have none 15 years ago, you don’t have any today.”</p>
<p>Lawyers for Lucio have expressed optimism that a new trial would ultimately exonerate their client. “We’re confident that with the new evidence of innocence, if Melissa was retried today that she would be acquitted,” Innocence Project attorney Vanessa Potkin <a href="https://youtu.be/VyFI8UllvmA" target="_blank">told</a> reporters on Monday afternoon. The legal team also addressed lingering questions about whether Saenz would even be eligible to retry Lucio. Attorneys for Lucio have long argued that Saenz has a conflict of interest due to the fact that Lucio’s defense attorney at trial, Peter Gilman, now works for him. “There is a motion pending in the trial court to disqualify him from further participation in this case,” Schardl said.</p>
<p>That decision will ultimately turn on another motion filed by Lucio’s lawyers, seeking the recusal of Cameron County District Court Judge Gabriela Garcia, whose court administrator was also part of Lucio’s legal team. On Monday, the CCA ordered Garcia to either recuse herself or have another judge rule on her disqualification within three days, Schardl explained. “And then whichever judge remains on the case will decide the disqualification of the district attorney if he does not recuse himself.”</p>
<p>Regardless of who ends up in charge, Lucio’s family and advocates are not waiting on the courts. On April 27, the day Lucio was set to die, they held <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FreeMelissaLucio/videos/270508138539927" target="_blank">another</a> rally outside the Cameron Country DA’s office, this time calling on Saenz to drop the charges. In front of a large white “Free Melissa Lucio” banner, Van Tassel looked up toward the courthouse where she had spent so much time working on the film that would bring Lucio’s story to the rest of the world. The state of Texas had planned to execute an anonymous woman, she said. “And today she’s no longer anonymous. Everybody knows who she is.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>As Johnny Galvan</u> flipped through YouTube videos on his flat-screen TV, Melissa Lucio’s face smiled back at him. She did not look like the woman he’d helped send to death row almost 15 years earlier. Here was a young Lucio posing in a feathered ’80s haircut, a hint of teal eyeshadow matching her outfit. There was an older Lucio laughing, her infant son John sitting in her lap. But then there was a more familiar image, the one repeatedly printed in the newspaper: Lucio’s mugshot; her eyes seemingly vacant, her mouth turned downward.</p>
<p>“Melissa Lucio is set to be executed on April 27,” a reporter said in a news segment from the previous week. “People that support her, though, say she was wrongly convicted and that her daughter’s death was an accident — and that that so-called confession was coerced.” The report cut to a clip of state lawmakers calling for clemency, led by a representative from North Texas. “As a conservative Republican who has long been a supporter of the death penalty in the most heinous cases,” he said, “I have never seen — have never seen — a more troubling case than the case of Melissa Lucio.”</p>

<p>“Wow,” Galvan said softly. For a moment it looked like he might cry. Galvan was one of the jurors who convicted Lucio in 2008 for killing her 2-year-old daughter, Mariah Alvarez. The little girl’s lifeless body had arrived at the hospital in Harlingen, Texas, covered in bruises; at trial, medical witnesses described it as the worst case of child abuse they had ever seen. Despite his horror, Galvan had been reluctant to impose a death sentence on Lucio. For a time, he was the lone holdout, but he’d ultimately voted for death. Now he feared that he’d made a grave mistake. “If I would have had the knowledge that I have now, Melissa would be free,” he said.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->
<p>It was a Tuesday in late March, and Galvan had been discussing the case for almost two hours. His uneaten lunch sat on the coffee table in his apartment in Brownsville, Texas. A large U.S flag hung above a large air rifle; on the opposite wall was a painting he’d gotten at Goodwill of an Indigenous woman next to a basket of jalapeño peppers. Galvan once worked as an art teacher in public schools. But at the time of Lucio’s trial, he’d been unemployed. “I told whoever was selecting the jury … ‘Look sir, I can’t be here, I have to be out there looking for a job. I’m responsible for my kids,’” he recalled. “And he said, ‘This is a job!’”</p>
<p>If Galvan had not been so stressed about finding work, perhaps he would have held out longer against the death penalty. But he felt pressured by his fellow jurors, who were also anxious to go home. One of them pointed to the Gospel of Matthew, which suggested that people who hurt small children should be thrown into the sea with a millstone around their necks. For Galvan, a devout Christian, the Bible passage was enough to persuade him.</p>
<p>Galvan thought about the case only occasionally in the years following Lucio’s trial. He never seriously considered that she would be put to death until he saw a news story in the Brownsville Herald in early March, which said she had been given an execution date. The next day, a lawyer and two law students showed up at his apartment. They asked him questions about what he remembered and shared information he’d been unaware of at trial. In a subsequent declaration, Galvan admitted that no evidence stood out to him that proved Lucio had murdered her daughter. “The fact that you can’t pinpoint what actually caused Mariah’s death means that she shouldn’t be executed,” he said.</p>
<p class="p1"><!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[2](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A1%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="1"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[2] --></p>
<p>In fact, there were a lot of things that bothered him about the case in hindsight. Lucio’s defense attorney went to work for the district attorney’s office shortly after the trial. The DA himself later went to federal prison on corruption charges. Then there was Lucio’s supposed confession on the night her daughter died. Jurors were shown footage of the more than five-hour interrogation. To Galvan, Lucio seemed less like a woman admitting to murder than a mother blaming herself for her daughter’s death. He remembered a Texas Ranger pushing Lucio to hit a doll like she had beaten Mariah — then demanding that she show him how she’d also bitten her daughter. At trial, “they showed us something that looked like a bite mark, but we couldn’t tell,” Galvan said. “I think she was just giving into the interrogation.”</p>
<p>“I used to live in the poorer sections of Brownsville,” Galvan said. There were a lot of struggling families living in rundown apartments like Lucio’s. She tried to tell authorities that Mariah had fallen down some stairs, but no one believed her. In retrospect, the account rang true. “It could have been any of us,” Galvan said. Now, as he searched for the latest videos about the case, Galvan’s voice was heavy with remorse. “We were overtaken by the tragedy that happened,” he said. “We probably wanted to blame someone. But we went the wrong way.”</p>

<h2>Failure at Every Turn</h2>
<p>Galvan is one of four jurors who now say they wished they’d been given more information before voting to sentence Lucio to death in 2008. A fifth, who served as an alternate, said that she believed Lucio should get a new trial “with the benefit of an actual defense.” Their affidavits are among hundreds of pages of exhibits included in a request for clemency that Lucio’s attorneys filed on March 22 with the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles.</p>
<p>Lucio’s clemency petition makes a convincing case that her life should be spared, arguing that faulty forensics could see her sent to the execution chamber for a crime that never happened. A host of experts have raised serious questions about the evidence used to convict her, including an interrogation built on coercion and a superficial medical inquiry that amplified a spurious and prejudicial claim that Lucio had bitten her daughter.</p>
<p>Lucio “ended up on death row through a horrific combination of investigative missteps and a prosecution unhinged from the truth,” the petition reads.</p>
<p>But realistically, clemency in Texas is a long shot. The board is made up of individuals appointed by Gov. Greg Abbott, and they generally do <a href="https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2011-09-16/perry-the-executioner/">the governor’s bidding</a>. Since Abbott assumed office in 2015, the board has recommended clemency in just two capital cases. Abbott accepted the board’s recommendation in one of those cases — an intervention that came <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/02/22/texas-gov-greg-abbott-thomas-whitaker-death-sentence/">less than an hour</a> before the scheduled execution. Under Texas law, Abbott’s power is limited to granting a one-time, 30-day stay of execution. Any additional relief requires a recommendation from the board.</p>

<p>With the likelihood of clemency so grim, the push to save Lucio has been increasingly driven by an unlikely source: the Texas House of Representatives. An unprecedented bipartisan group of representatives — more than half the members of the Texas House — wrote a letter imploring the board and Abbott to stop Lucio’s execution. Their efforts have been led by Republican Rep. Jeff Leach and Democratic Rep. Joe Moody, who also co-chair the chamber’s Criminal Justice Reform Caucus.</p>
<p>The facts surrounding Mariah’s death are “still in grave dispute,” Leach said at a <a href="https://house.texas.gov/video-audio/press-conference/">press conference</a> shortly after Lucio’s clemency packet was filed. “The system literally failed Lucio at every single turn. And I am going to do everything that I possibly can in the coming days, in every way possible, legal, constitutional — and maybe in some ways we haven’t thought of yet — to delay and to prevent Ms. Lucio’s execution.”</p>
<p>Leach and Moody also traveled with several of their colleagues to the prison where female death row prisoners are held for a meeting with Lucio that included a prayer session in one of the prison’s stark white rooms. Two weeks later, they convened a <a href="https://house.texas.gov/video-audio/committee-broadcasts/87/">meeting</a> of the House’s interim Criminal Justice Reform Committee to question Cameron County District Attorney Luis Saenz, who had requested Lucio’s execution date. The whole situation was clearly troubling to Leach.</p>
<p>“To say I’m wrestling with the very existence of the death penalty in Texas would be a dramatic understatement,” <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/tx/south-texas-el-paso/news/2022/04/08/texas-lawmakers-visit-woman-on-death-row-with-hugs--prayers">he said</a>.</p>

<h2>A Rush to Judgment</h2>
<p>At the heart of Lucio’s case is the question of whether her daughter’s death resulted from repeated physical abuse, as the state contends, or a tragic accident. Lucio has maintained since the beginning that Mariah fell down a hazardous staircase in the days preceding her death, and experts who have since reviewed the case at the behest of Lucio’s lawyers say the toddler’s injuries were consistent with such a fall.</p>
<p>But no one ever investigated the possibility that Mariah’s untimely death was the result of an accident. Instead, from the beginning, the authorities seized upon child abuse as the only explanation. According to the clemency petition, the cops and the doctors who testified against Lucio based their determinations on faulty assumptions and flawed science.</p>
<p>No one seemed more certain of Lucio’s guilt than the cops who arrived at the ER and took her to the station for questioning. As The Intercept <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/03/05/melissa-lucio-texas-death-penalty/">previously reported</a>, Lucio’s interrogators — an assembly line of cops that included Texas Ranger Victor Escalon — deployed a mix of guilt-presumptive and coercive techniques known to produce <a href="https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/detaillist.aspx?View=%7bFAF6EDDB-5A68-4F8F-8A52-2C61F5BF9EA7%7d&amp;FilterField1=FC&amp;FilterValue1=8%5FFC">false confessions</a>, particularly from vulnerable individuals like Lucio, whose life had been defined by abuse and trauma. The cops repeatedly showed Lucio graphic photos of her dead daughter and then fed her suggestions about what might have caused the injuries, suggestions that Lucio then parroted back to them.</p>
<p>Just after 3 a.m., as the marathon interrogation was coming to a close, Escalon pulled his chair close to Lucio, who looked dazed and weary, and showed her a series of photos of Mariah’s bruised body. He asked her to demonstrate on a plastic baby doll how she’d inflicted the various injuries. “Don’t hold back,” Escalon told her. “Do it and get it over with.” He said they would start with the “bite mark.” There were two on Mariah’s back, he said. “Just re-enact how you did it.”</p>
<p>“Do I have to?” Lucio asked. Yes, he replied. Lucio held the doll upright with its back to her face and told Escalon that she just put her mouth there and bit her. Escalon asked why she did it; Lucio said she didn’t know.</p>
<p>David Thompson, a certified forensic interviewer whose report is included in the clemency package, concluded that the outcome of the interrogation was wholly unreliable. Thompson is president of Wicklander-Zulawski &amp; Associates, a law enforcement training organization that advocates for evidence-based interview approaches. “Lucio’s admissions occurred after multiple examples of fact-feeding, revealing of evidence, and modifications of her story,” he wrote. “This created a contaminated confession.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[6](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[6] -->“Lucio’s admissions occurred after multiple examples of fact-feeding, revealing of evidence, and modifications of her story. This created a contaminated confession.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[6] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[6] -->
<p>This guilt-presumptive approach spilled over into the medical investigation. Emergency room doctor Alfredo Vargas testified that Mariah’s injuries, including abrasions on her back that he labeled “bite marks,” showed that she had been horribly abused. Dr. Norma Jean Farley, the forensic pathologist who autopsied Mariah, also concluded that the child had been beaten to death. Trial records indicate that before Farley even cut into the body, she’d already made up her mind. “I mean, it would have been evident to a first-year nursing student,” she testified. The bite mark was “obvious,” Farley told the jury, because it was a “big bite!” She said it looked as though the person who bit Mariah had dragged their teeth across her back, creating a painful wound.</p>
<p>“There appears to be a bite with raking, where it just pulls the flesh off the back?” prosecutor Alfredo Padilla asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Farley replied.</p>
<p>To Dr. Adam Freeman, a forensic dentist, this testimony was nonsense. “It is so inflammatory to walk into a courtroom and say, ‘This is a big bite mark. It was made by an adult; the skin was raked and peeled back,’” Freeman said</p>
<p>The most basic problem with Farley’s assertion is that bite-mark evidence is <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2016/09/07/white-house-report-concludes-that-bite-mark-analysis-is-junk-science/">neither valid nor reliable</a>. To date, it has been implicated in at least 35 wrongful convictions and criminal indictments. Yet, for years, practitioners have claimed the ability not only to detect which injuries left on skin were made by teeth, but also the ability to match a given injury to the dentition of a particular person. In 2016, the Texas Forensic Science Commission <a href="https://www.txcourts.gov/media/1440871/finalbitemarkreport.pdf">recommended a moratorium</a> on its use as evidence in criminal prosecutions.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[7](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[7] -->
<p>But even if it were a valid practice, Freeman argues, Farley was not qualified to opine one way or another. She hadn’t been trained in the discipline and no forensic dentist ever provided a report or took the stand to back up Farley’s bald assertion. As such, her testimony that the mark on Mariah’s back was the result of an adult bite served no other purpose than to prejudice the jury. “If I were in a courtroom,” Freeman said, “and saw pictures of a dead baby and then heard that description, and I think you’d probably, too, you’d say, ‘Let’s hang the bastard,’ right?”</p>
<p>Dr. Thomas Young, a veteran forensic pathologist in Kansas City, Missouri, who first reviewed the case as part of Lucio’s state post-conviction appeal, opined in 2010 that the abrasion Farley, Vargas, and the cops decided was a bite mark was consistent with a scrape incurred from a fall down a flight of stairs.</p>
<p>Young <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/03/05/melissa-lucio-texas-death-penalty/">concluded</a> that Mariah had died from a blunt head injury, consistent with a fall, with “delayed effects”: brain swelling with repercussions that developed over several days, including a blood-clotting disorder that can cause extensive internal and external bruising.</p>
<p>Several doctors who reviewed the case and provided declarations for the clemency package agreed, including renowned pediatric forensic pathologist Dr. Janice Ophoven. Ophoven said that there was forensic evidence that Mariah was suffering from that coagulation disorder — known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, or DIC — which can result from trauma. Falls, she noted, “remain the No. 1 cause for traumatic brain injury in children of Mariah’s age,” and Mariah had a history of falls, including one at day care in 2006 after which she’d lost consciousness.</p>
<p>The medical evidence was “consistent with a cause of death related to a fall down the stairs two days before Mariah’s collapse,” Ophoven concluded. “There are several potential causes and contributions to Mariah’s injuries and death that have nothing to do with intentional force.”</p>
<p>The failure to consider Mariah’s history of falls or her family’s account of the days preceding her death is problematic, because child abuse is a diagnosis of exclusion. “Medical guidance, including from the American Academy of Pediatrics, is clear that before determining whether injuries were caused by child abuse, physicians must rule out coagulopathies, such as DIC,” Dr. Michael Laposata, chair of the Department of Pathology at the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, wrote in a declaration.</p>
<p>“Dr. Farley’s inverted approach critically left key evidence uncollected and obscured the true story of Mariah’s death,” the clemency petition reads.</p>
<p>There is another key piece of evidence the doctors reviewing the case noted: In the hospital, well after Mariah had been found unresponsive and then declared dead, her body temperature was recorded at over 100 degrees, meaning that before death she’d been battling an infection. How that factored into Mariah’s demise went unexplored. Such an elevated temperature would be consistent in a child who has DIC. But it would be “highly unusual” in a child who died as a result of abuse, Dr. Harry Davis wrote in his declaration.</p>
<p>Davis’s declaration contains another troubling revelation: Although Vargas testified at Lucio’s trial that he was the emergency room doctor on duty the night Mariah died and had declared her death, Davis said that <em>he</em> was the attending physician — and thus the primary doctor responsible for directing her care. He recalled Mariah being brought into the hospital unresponsive; his efforts to revive her failed. He was the one — not Vargas, he said — who pronounced Mariah dead. Davis said that Vargas, who worked in a different division in the ER where less acute patients were treated, came to assist him later, after he’d already begun treating Mariah.</p>
<p>While Vargas, who died in 2015, readily endorsed the state’s child abuse narrative, Davis would not have been so quick to do so, he said. In large part that came down to Mariah’s elevated temperature. “I know State investigators prosecuted Mariah Alvarez’s death as abuse. I have had considerable doubt about this conclusion,” he wrote. “The presence of active infection at the time of … death suggests alternative medical explanations for the bruising and internal bleeding that should have been explored.”</p>
<p>Although Mariah’s medical records would have included Davis’s name and notations about her fever, he was never contacted by police, prosecutors, or the defense. Roughly eight months after Mariah’s death, Davis moved out of Texas. “I was never asked to testify,” he wrote. “In fact, I was not even aware there was a trial. I would have testified to what I’ve said here.”</p>

<h2>Running Out of Time</h2>
<p>The office of District Attorney Luis Saenz is on the fourth floor of the Cameron County court complex in Brownsville’s historic district. In late March, the reception area was decorated for Easter, with a large artificial tree and plush garden gnomes in bunny ears. The DA’s mission statement appeared in large block letters on the wall: “To protect the public by providing a safe community while safeguarding the rights of victims and above all to see that justice is done.”</p>
<p>After being elected in 2012 to replace <a href="https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/South-Texas-DA-indicted-in-bribery-and-kickback-3541102.php">disgraced</a> District Attorney Armando Villalobos, Saenz launched a special unit to combat domestic violence, complete with a dedicated vehicle that sat in the courthouse parking lot. Dramatic window decals showed women’s faces partially covered with scrawled messages like “HELP” and “I thought he loved me.”</p>
<p>Yet Saenz has thus far been unmoved by those who explain how Lucio’s own history as a survivor of sexual abuse and domestic violence impacted her case. The clemency packet included a letter signed by dozens of Texas organizations and advocates combating domestic violence, who echoed what many experts have said about Lucio’s interrogation: “Contrary to what we know are the best practices for engaging with trauma survivors, the police who interrogated her employed coercive techniques designed to intimidate her and extract a confession.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the parking lot was a pair of lawn signs that had been placed by Death Penalty Action. One read “WATCH THE FILM” in English and Spanish, a rallying cry referencing the documentary “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN2cGWGO984">The State v. Melissa</a>.” For weeks, activists and family members had stood vigil outside the courthouse, pausing only after Lucio’s eldest son, John, successfully approached Saenz during his lunch hour. “I don’t want anybody to feel I’m out here trying to cause problems,” John politely told the DA, “but I know for a simple fact that my mother is an innocent woman.”</p>

<p>John urged Saenz to consider the materials in the clemency packet — particularly the statements from the jurors who said they had not been given all the facts at trial. Approached by The Intercept, Saenz refused to say whether he’d read the jurors’ declarations yet. “I’m not giving any interviews about the Melissa Lucio case,” he said. “I’ve got a lot of other work in addition to that.”</p>
<p>In late March, John and his wife, Michelle, pulled up at a cemetery just north of Harlingen. Mariah was buried in a small plot toward the back, where the land gave way to a tangle of mesquite and wildflowers. The grave was unmarked aside from an angel statuette left by a family friend years back; John was in the process of getting a headstone. One Easter they laid down a miniature fence and some colorful eggs. “It was very, very beautiful,” John said.</p>
<p>In his signature black “Free Melissa Lucio” T-shirt, John spoke quickly, almost frantically, about the campaign to save his mother’s life. Although he’d never planned to stand idly by as the state tried to kill his mother, he had no idea what to do after she got her execution date. “I was lost, I was confused,” he said. “What do I do next?” He was grateful to the activists who had attracted public support for Lucio on a level he’d never imagined. One lawmaker had even urged him not to make funeral plans.</p>

<p>Still, the high-profile organizing has taken a toll on the family. With Lucio’s story more prominent than ever, old traumas resurfaced, aggravating wounds that had never healed. The anguish and upheaval from Lucio’s death sentence was embedded in a letter from her children and declarations included in the clemency petition, which described her as a loving mother whose execution would devastate her family. “By killing her you will be killing me too,” her daughter Melissa wrote.</p>
<p>Over the phone, Johnny Galvan, the former juror, expressed dismay that Saenz had brushed off questions about Lucio’s case. Maybe he would call himself. “If he’s the only person that can do something from Brownsville, I should be in touch with him,” he said. “And I’m not just anybody. I’m one of the jurors.”</p>
<p>Galvan never reached the DA. But two weeks later, on April 12, he stood before members of the Criminal Justice Reform Committee at the Texas State Capitol in Austin. Galvan has poor eyesight, so his daughter Carmen read a statement to the lawmakers on her father’s behalf, which urged the governor to intervene. “The idea that my decision to take another person’s life was not based on complete and accurate information and a fair trial is horrifying. … If I could take back my vote I would,” she read. “I will be haunted by Ms. Lucio’s execution if it goes forward.”</p>
<p>Afterward, Saenz himself joined the meeting remotely. It was the first time he had publicly addressed Lucio’s case. For those who hoped Saenz might stop the execution, his exchange with the lawmakers was disappointing, even surreal. The DA seemed indifferent to the new issues raised in the case — and unaware of the basic facts, including when, exactly, Lucio was scheduled to die. He denied that he could simply withdraw Lucio’s death warrant, even though her execution date had been set at his request. Instead, he pointed to the courts, where there are several issues still pending. If the courts didn’t act before the execution, Saenz said he would step in — before immediately contradicting himself, saying he had no legal reason to intervene.</p>
<p>“My hope is that the right thing is done — by somebody,” Leach, the committee co-chair, said. But he told Saenz what the DA already knew: “You have the power right now, singlehandedly, tonight, to withdraw this request.” After all, there was no harm in delaying Lucio’s execution — certainly not compared to the harm of executing a potentially innocent woman.</p>
<p>Leach acknowledged John Lucio and his family, who were seated in the audience. “They are your constituents. And they are begging you to just press the pause button,” he said. “Has a single member of the victim’s family requested you or urged you to set this date for execution?” Saenz had no answer to that question.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>By the time</u> the last witness took the stand at Nashville’s downtown criminal court to testify in the case of Claude Garrett, it was hard to know what more could be said. The hearing was the final step in a long fight to correct a miscarriage of justice: a nearly 30-year-old murder conviction that the district attorney himself had disavowed.</p>
<p>Garrett was convicted of setting a 1992 fire that killed his 24-year-old girlfriend Lorie Lance. Prosecutors said Garrett locked Lance in a utility room and poured kerosene throughout the house. For decades he’d proclaimed his innocence — and last November, the Davidson County District Attorney’s Office <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/11/24/claude-garrett-murder-wrongful-conviction/" target="_blank">released</a> a long-awaited report by its Conviction Review Unit, which had reinvestigated the case. It concluded that the state’s original arson theory was bogus. There was not a single reliable piece of evidence to show that Garrett had set the fire.</p>
<p>Garrett and his supporters had hoped he might be home for Christmas. But first a judge had to formally sign off on a motion to vacate his conviction. After months of delay — first a snowstorm, then a new presiding judge — lawyers for Garrett finally had a chance to present the evidence that his jurors had never heard. The DA’s office, meanwhile, had a chance to explain why the CRU findings supported Garrett’s bid for freedom. It was now up to fire scientist Greg Gorbett, the state’s sole witness, to drive home for Judge Monte Watkins why he should rule in Garrett’s favor.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>Gorbett, 41, was far younger than the many of the veteran fire experts who previously examined the case. He came of age at a time when investigators were being forced to discard long-held myths used to identify arson and replace them with science. One such myth had been the lynchpin to Garrett’s conviction: a large irregular burn mark on the floor of the house, which investigators labeled a “pour pattern” — proof that an ignitable liquid had been used to set the fire. Today, <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2015/02/24/junkscienceclaudegarrett/">such evidence is widely regarded as junk science</a>. Burn patterns like these can actually be produced through a phenomenon called <a href="https://www.usfa.fema.gov/blog/cb-050520.html#:~:text=Flashover%20is%20a%20thermally%2Ddriven,°F%20for%20ordinary%20combustibles." target="_blank">flashover</a>, or the moment a fire in a room becomes a room on fire. For Gorbett’s generation of fire experts, cases like Garrett’s were a relic of another age. “They didn’t follow the scientific method — or even any real science we had in 1992,” Gorbett said.</p>

<p>Nashville prosecutor Sunny Eaton, the head of the CRU, walked Gorbett through the work of the state’s star witness at trial, Special Agent James Cooper of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. Cooper claimed to be able to tell that a fire was arson through his visual observations alone — a hallmark of wrongful arson convictions. But he had also taken samples from various areas at the scene where he believed he might find kerosene. “What does he then do with those samples?” Eaton asked.</p>
<p>Gorbett’s face broke into a slightly pained smile. “He puts them together in a can,” he replied.</p>
<p>“In the same can?” Eaton asked. Yes, Gorbett said.</p>
<p>One didn’t have to be a fire scientist to see the problem. With the samples mixed together, there was no way to know where an ignitable liquid may have been present — a crucial factor in determining whether the fire was arson. “If there was an ignitable liquid, then he just cross-contaminated everything,” Gorbett explained.</p>
<p>This was hardly the most shocking revelation to date about the evidence that sent Garrett to prison. Experts have pointed to myriad blunders over the years: the fire marshal who smelled kerosene and immediately assumed it was arson; the failure by Cooper to interview firefighters or reconstruct the scene; and perhaps most stunning, the total lack of examination — or even decent photographs — of the door or latch that supposedly trapped Lance inside the utility room. This was the alleged “murder weapon,” Eaton told the judge. Yet police did nothing to preserve it.</p>
<p>If anything, the testimony about the contaminated samples added a layer of absurdity to a conviction that has been so thoroughly discredited, many in the courtroom wondered why Watkins wouldn’t just free Garrett on the spot. Instead, after closing statements, the judge said he would have a decision as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Garrett’s daughter Deana, who traveled hundreds of miles for the hearing, had hoped to walk out of court with her father that day. As she listened to the testimony about the botched fire investigation, she found herself getting angry. For all the high-level science brought to bear in debunking the case against Garrett, his conviction had largely come down to a basic mix of ineptitude and misconduct: a shoddy investigation, unqualified experts, and prosecutors who concealed key evidence from the defense. After Garrett’s original conviction was thrown out in 2001 following the discovery of a police report containing critical exculpatory information, the DA’s office simply retried him, winning a second conviction in 2003.</p>
<p>Deana planned to stay in Nashville, hoping every day for a ruling. But no one seemed to know when a decision would come down. Once again, the only thing to do was wait.</p>

<h2>Myths and Misconceptions</h2>
<p>I first met Claude Garrett in 2013. By then, his case had already been reviewed by two leading fire scientists who made clear that the evidence used to convict him was junk science. Another expert, East Tennessee fire investigator Stuart Bayne, who testified at Garrett’s retrial, had become his most passionate advocate, meeting with me multiple times to explain <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/02/29/claude-garrett-arson-junk-science-updates/">why the state’s theory of the fire was impossible</a>.</p>
<p>Although additional experts came forward soon after The Intercept’s <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2015/02/24/junkscienceclaudegarrett/">2015 investigation</a> into the case, there was no clear path to exoneration. When Garrett presented a new set of reports to his trial court in 2017, the Tennessee attorney general’s office objected, saying they reflected no new evidence but merely “newly written opinions.” The court dismissed Garrett’s motion without a hearing.</p>
<p>In 2018, Garrett <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/02/24/claude-garrett-arson-case-parole-denied/">went</a> before the Tennessee Board of Parole, where he insisted on his innocence. Although the board chair voted in his favor, Garrett was ultimately denied parole. Later that year, however, The Intercept’s coverage caught the attention of the Davidson County DA’s office, which had recently launched the Conviction Review Unit. Then the <a href="https://www.tninnocence.org/">Tennessee Innocence Project</a> launched in Nashville, and Garrett became one of its first clients. In August 2019, Innocence Project lawyers and the state federal public defender’s office filed an application to the CRU on Garrett’s behalf. But it was not until Sunny Eaton <a href="https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/pithinthewind/a-nashville-defense-attorney-takes-over-the-da-s-conviction-review-unit/article_aff9cdc2-3c3a-5c40-8232-d88fe1b59539.html" target="_blank">took over</a> in September 2020 that the reinvestigation made real progress.</p>
<p>The hearing took place on a rainy day in early April. The first person to address the court was Lance’s sister, Haley Smith. Although she was only a little girl when her sister died, she had become the family’s main spokesperson over the years. She had opposed Garrett’s release on parole, and she opposed his release now. But she also seemed resigned to the outcome of the DA’s investigation, which she described as biased in Garrett’s favor. Her voice shook as she held up a photograph of her sister for the judge, to “let you remember who the true victim in the case was.”</p>
<p>In her opening statement, Eaton described the CRU’s exhaustive review of the case. She emphasized that the DA’s office had not relied on Garrett’s expert witnesses but solicited independent reviews from their own experts. “The primary question before the state was always: What happened to Lorie Lance?” she said. But the DA’s duties to the victim also required that other questions be answered. “Does new scientific evidence exist that was unheard by a jury that would lead us as an office to lose confidence in Mr. Garrett’s conviction?” Next, if the DA’s office had known in 1993 or 2003 what it knows today, would it have indicted Garrett for murder? And finally, would a reasonable jury today convict Garrett today?</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[4](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[4] -->
<p>We may never know what happened to Lorie Lance, Eaton said, in part because the investigation into the fire was so flawed. But the CRU had reached a firm conclusion on the rest of the questions. New evidence “dismantles all evidence of Mr. Garrett’s guilt in this case.”</p>
<p>The first defense witness was famed fire scientist John Lentini, who first testified on Garrett’s behalf in 2010. To explain just how profoundly the field had evolved, Lentini gave a presentation on the history of fire investigation, starting with a video showing how a smoldering cigarette in a couch could quickly lead to a conflagration. The point was to demonstrate flashover, a critical factor in determining a fire’s origin and cause, Lentini explained. But at the time of the fire in Garrett’s case, investigators were not trained to understand the phenomenon.</p>
<p>“Before 1992, the fire investigation was riddled with myths and misconceptions,” Lentini explained. Although a landmark <a href="https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=921" target="_blank">guidebook</a> by the National Fire Protection Association was published the same year as the fire, many of the myths persisted through Garrett’s 2003 trial.</p>
<p>But Lentini also made clear that the investigation into the fire had been shockingly inadequate even for the loose standards in place at the time. He emphasized the significance of the utility room door. Confirming that Lance was locked inside the room should have been the most critical question from the start — the difference between a murder and an accident. Had investigators preserved the door and latch, they could have studied the smoke deposits left behind. In fact, the few photographs taken of the door showed soot on the part of the latch that would have been protected had it been in a closed position. It also showed burns on the side of the door, which suggested it had been open during the fire.</p>
<p>Yet at the retrial, Cooper, the ATF special agent, dismissed such evidence. “I don’t care about the carbon on that latch,” he said. To Lentini, this was shocking testimony. “There’s physical evidence fire investigators are supposed to be looking at,” he said. “He never looked at it.”</p>
<p>The next witness was Candace Ashby, a battalion commander at the Indianapolis Fire Department who runs a private fire investigation company. Ashby was hired to do an experiment in 2019 by a TV producer working on an episode about Garrett’s case. To investigate what smoke deposits might have shown if the evidence had been preserved in 1992, she got permission to do a live fire test at an empty warehouse outside Nashville. Two slide locks were placed onto wooden boards: one in an unlocked position and the other in a locked position. The boards were then exposed to intense heat and flames. Afterward, Ashby reported that the slide lock in the unlocked position “showed carbon build up had collected on the exposed bolt,” whereas the other bolt had no such build up, since it had been protected by the exterior of the lock.</p>
<p>The experiment supported what Lentini has long argued: that the door to the utility room was unlocked during the fire. But it also supported Ashby’s own experience as a firefighter. As she explained on the stand, it was very unlikely that a firefighter with limited vision, wearing thick gloves and heavy gear, could have manipulated such a small latch to get into the room where Lance was found. If anything, they would have kicked down the door. For Ashby, it was inconceivable that someone would have found Lance trapped inside the room and not immediately announced that the door was locked. “The first thing they would have done is tell everybody on that scene who would listen,” she said. “Because that’s really significant. And that was not done in this case.”</p>

<h2>A Bittersweet Day</h2>
<p>In a face mask and blue jeans, Garrett sat in handcuffs throughout the hearing. Friends and advocates had come to support him, some of whom he had not seen in years. But he restrained himself from waving hello. He considered the hearing a somber occasion. Lance had still lost her life. “And she’s been looked at as a murder victim,” he said in a phone call from prison afterward. “Her family’s been told that for 30 years.”</p>
<p>Garrett found himself getting emotional during the video played by Lentini, which brought back the trauma of the fire. “Thinking back about, you know, everything that was going on at that moment,” he said, “what Lorie was going through.” The hearing was also bittersweet for another reason: His mother had always hoped to see his freedom, but she died in 2020. Asked what he thought she would say now, Garrett responded, “I’m glad you guys finally caught up. I’ve always known that he wouldn’t do this — not that he didn’t, but that he wouldn’t.”</p>
<p>For Bayne, the fire investigator and advocate for Garrett, the hearing was a vindication of everything he had argued for decades. During one of their regularly scheduled phone calls, Bayne also picked up something different in Garrett, a sense that he was allowing himself to look toward the future. “The words he’s used over these years is ‘guardedly optimistic,’” Bayne said. He encouraged Garrett to stay that way until the decision came down. But Garrett sounded ready to leave prison behind. “He’s about to close a chapter — and really hoping that that page actually gets turned.”</p>

On one condition: After repeatedly proclaiming his innocence since the spring of 1985, McCrory would have to say that he’d been guilty all along.</p>
<p>The offer came via his lawyer, Mark Loudon-Brown of the Atlanta-based Southern Center for Human Rights, on the eve of an evidentiary hearing in Andalusia, Alabama. As Loudon-Brown told Covington County Circuit Judge Lex Short the next day, Chief Assistant District Attorney Grace Jeter indicated “that if Mr. McCrory would be willing to admit guilt in this case, she had authority to consent to his release from prison.”</p>
<p>But McCrory said no. “He does not wish to do that,” Loudon-Brown said. “And so I wanted to make sure the record was clear on that.” A few feet away, Jeter remained expressionless. The judge asked if she had any response. “No, sir,” she said. The hearing would move forward as planned.</p>
<p>It was just after 1 p.m. on April 28, 2021, at the county courthouse in Andalusia, a small city just north of the Florida border. Down a hill behind the courthouse is the old county jail where McCrory was held following his arrest. Listed in the National Register of Historic Places, the decaying brick building stood grimly juxtaposed against a fleet of trucks belonging to the Covington Casket Company, the county’s oldest manufacturer. Covid-19 had brought a boom in business; on the day of the hearing, warehouse workers listened to music while lining caskets with fabric.</p>

The evidence against her husband was paltry at best, but prosecutors moved aggressively; McCrory was swiftly tried and convicted of murder. After insisting on his innocence for 3 1/2 decades, McCrory secured a new legal team, which filed a petition for a new trial in March 2020. His lawyers argued that new evidence debunked the most crucial component of the state’s case: alleged teeth marks found on Julie’s body, which a famed bite-mark expert, Dr. Richard Souviron, said conclusively matched McCrory’s unique dentition.</p>
<p>Souviron, the prosecution’s star witness at McCrory’s trial, has since changed his tune. In a 2019 affidavit, he recanted his testimony.</p>
<p>“As a forensic odontologist I no longer believe the individualized teeth marks comparison testimony I offered in his case was reliable or proper,” he wrote. “I no longer believe, as I did at the time of trial, that there is a valid scientific basis for concluding that the injury found on the skin of the victim in this case, assuming that the injury is in fact teeth marks, could be ‘matched’ or otherwise connected to a specific individual, such as Mr. McCrory.”</p>
<p>Rather than exonerate McCrory, however, prosecutors fought back, arguing among other things that because McCrory had challenged Souviron’s testimony in a previous appeal, he was barred from trying again. In December 2020, Short granted an evidentiary hearing to allow both sides to make their case.</p>
<p>It would be a consequential hearing. Over the last decade, bite-mark analysis has been thoroughly debunked as junk forensic science, a subjective pattern-matching practice that has seen dozens of people wrongly convicted. In fact, according to the Innocence Project — which has been on a mission to banish bite-mark evidence from the courtroom — McCrory is the last remaining defendant known to have been convicted almost solely on the faulty forensic practice. The expert witnesses at McCrory’s evidentiary hearing were dentists who were once true believers but now use their expertise to correct their colleagues’ past mistakes and educate judges about erroneous bite-mark analysis.</p>

<p>Although the science was on their side, McCrory’s lawyers were up against a criminal legal system that often favors finality over accuracy. They would still be fighting an uphill battle against prosecutors, and the courts, to clear their client’s name.</p>
<p>McCrory was not in attendance at the hearing. He was watching remotely from a minimum-security prison 175 miles to the north. Before he went to prison, McCrory was a computer whiz who taught classes at the local junior college — “a geek before it was fashionable to be one,” as one of his trial attorneys put it. McCrory’s son, Chad, recalled his grandmother saying that McCrory once claimed that every household would have a computer one day. “She was like, ‘Hey, no way, that&#8217;s just crazy,’” Chad said.</p>

That testimony convicted an innocent man.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[3] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[3] -->
<p>Chad was just 3 years old when his mom was murdered and his dad incarcerated. Now 39, he believes in his father’s innocence, which has left him estranged from his mother’s side of the family. In a blue suit, Chad sat with his wife and aunts on the left side of the courtroom, while his maternal uncle sat on the right, accompanied by his family and the former Covington County district attorney whose office charged McCrory back in 1985.</p>
<p>Loudon-Brown turned things over to Chris Fabricant, director of strategic litigation at the Innocence Project, who has led the legal efforts to extirpate bite-mark evidence. “Your Honor, at the time of Mr. McCrory’s 1985 trial, there had never been a single wrongful conviction attributable to the use of bite-mark evidence,” Fabricant began. The forensic discipline was widely accepted in courtrooms across the country. But “the Innocence Project has documented 35 wrongful convictions and indictments attributable to the use of bite-mark comparison in criminal trials,” he went on. “As we stand here today, bite marks are no longer accepted in the scientific community.”</p>
<p>Fabricant emphasized that Souviron himself, one of the field’s founding practitioners, had disavowed his testimony against McCrory. “There was no science behind what he had to say. The testimony had no value. That testimony convicted an innocent man.”</p>
<h2>Woman Down</h2>
<p>As Charles McCrory recalled, the day his wife was found murdered started out fairly routine.</p>
<p>It was May 31, 1985, and the Alabama Electric Cooperative, where he worked as information systems manager, had just switched to a 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. workday. It only meant coming in half an hour earlier, but he still hadn’t nailed the timing, and that Friday he was running late, meaning he didn’t have time to swing by Hardee’s to pick up a biscuit and a Coke for breakfast.</p>
<p>The same thing had happened the day before. Julie had dropped by his office and agreed to make a run to Hardee’s. As he later recounted, McCrory thought maybe she’d help him out again, so he picked up the phone at his desk and called her.</p>
<p>The couple had recently separated after a decade together. They’d met as students at Andalusia High School. McCrory was 17 and Julie was 14. They dated for five years before getting married. In 1982 they had a son, Chad. But lately they’d been struggling. McCrory was bored; he and Julie had been together so long. Their sex life was great, but he’d been feeling like he needed more. He’d had an affair with a co-worker at the local junior college, though he’d mostly broken that off too.</p>
<p>Still, he and Julie got along well. Although he’d moved out, they still spent plenty of time together. In fact, he’d been over at the house they’d shared on Lori Lane the previous evening. Julie did his laundry. They sat in the den and played with Chad while &#8220;Hill Street Blues&#8221; was on TV, before stealing away to the bedroom to have sex. Julie removed a fabric belt from one of her dresses and loosely tied his wrists to the bedpost; he didn’t object. He left the house with two baskets of freshly folded laundry just after the nightly news came on. He kissed Julie and Chad goodbye and pulled his Ford Bronco out of the driveway with a honk and a wave — Chad always liked it when he did that.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[4](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A4%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="4"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[4] -->
<p>But on Friday morning, Julie was not answering the phone. She didn’t have to be at work until 8, so maybe she was in transit to his parents’ house, where McCrory’s mom watched Chad on workdays. McCrory called his mom, who said Julie hadn’t been by yet. At 8 he called her job; Julie wasn’t there.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, McCrory’s mom called back. She was worried. Julie had never been so late to drop off Chad. She told McCrory that his father was going to the house on Lori Lane to check on them. McCrory was worried now too. As he headed out in his Bronco, the two-way radio mounted in the cab crackled with life. McCrory was a longtime volunteer with the city’s rescue squad and served as the crew’s second-in-command. The radio communicated on both rescue squad and Andalusia Police Department channels.</p>
<p>He recognized the voice coming over the radio as that of Jeff Holland, a city fire department employee; they were making a run to Lori Lane. All they knew was that “a woman was down,” McCrory later recalled. He told Holland that he was also en route. McCrory arrived before the squad. He was headed toward the front door when he ran into his dad, who was in a frenzy. Something was “bad wrong” with Julie, he told McCrory.</p>
<p>McCrory went into the house. All the lights were off. Julie was lying prone just inside the entrance. Her pink nightgown was pushed up around her torso. Her head was turned to the side, beaten and bloodied, and her eyes were blackened. She was obviously dead. McCrory rushed out of the house stricken. He asked his dad about Chad and his father said he was OK; he’d found Chad in his bed. The boy was now across the street, where the neighbors were taking care of him.</p>
<p>When the rescue squad arrived, McCrory approached Holland and told him that Julie was dead. Holland checked her for vital signs before calling the police.</p>
<p>Investigators Billy Treadaway and Wade Garrett were the first cops to arrive. Treadaway quickly realized they would need backup. He radioed police dispatch and asked them to call a forensics guy, Charlie Brooks, from the state crime lab about an hour away. Treadaway put crime scene tape around the property and talked to McCrory. “He said that he hoped that I get the fellow that done it,” Treadaway later testified.</p>
<p>Brooks, Treadaway, and Garrett examined the scene. The house wasn’t immaculate, but it was about what you’d expect with a toddler around. Treadaway didn’t see any signs of a struggle or forced entry, and McCrory’s father said the front door was ajar when he’d arrived. There were no bloody footprints or fingerprints. Two windows in the master bedroom were open, but the investigators disregarded this, according to court records. Instead, as the day warmed up, they closed them and turned on the air conditioning.</p>
<p>Garrett, who previously worked for the Alabama Bureau of Investigation and had been trained as a fingerprint examiner, did not dust the windows for prints. He also failed to print a sliding glass door, and he never went into the bathroom. In fact, even though he remained at the house until early the following morning, Garrett didn’t dust much of anything save for the front doorknob, a pitcher on the kitchen table, a chair that was pulled back from the table, and some fast-food promotional glasses in the sink — two Snoopy glasses and a Care Bears glass.</p>

<p>Eventually the investigators made a closer inspection of Julie’s body. Her head had been bashed in and the front of her nightgown was saturated with blood. There were hairs in her left hand and on her chest, which Brooks collected. He noted that a length of pantyhose was tied around her right wrist. There was also a red bandanna on the floor not far from her body.</p>
<p>The investigators searched for a murder weapon to no avail. Although no one inspected the kitchen knives or any other sharp utensils, Treadaway did notice that a fire poker, part of a set of tools in the den, was missing. At some point, Garrett’s attention was called to a footprint outside — just beyond the McCrorys’ back fence, which abutted the property of a local business, Bullard Excavating. The footprint was photographed.</p>
<p>Around 6 p.m., Brooks and Treadaway drove Julie’s body nearly three hours north to Montgomery, where Dr. Joseph Sapala, a state medical examiner, conducted the autopsy. There were long bruises across the back of Julie’s hand, and her jaw was broken in two places. There were 11 small, rectangular puncture wounds to her chest — at more than four inches deep, they’d damaged her left lung and pulmonary artery. And then there were the head wounds, which Sapala ultimately determined to be the cause of death. Six were described as “chop wounds,” presumably blows made by a sharp instrument. Another Sapala described as a blunt force injury that fractured Julie’s skull.</p>
<p>Finally, the medical examiner noted one additional injury: Two “semi-lunar” indentations to the back of Julie’s right arm. He placed a penny by the wounds for scale — together they were no wider than the coin’s diameter — and an assistant took a photo. Sapala concluded that this was a bite mark.</p>
<p>While Sapala catalogued the many injuries Julie had sustained, his resulting report was cursory. It did not indicate whether her body was in rigor, nor did it mention the degree of lividity — the gravitational pooling of blood in the body after death — both of which might have provided at least a general time of death. Instead, in trial testimony, it was Brooks who offered the lay opinion that Julie had been killed sometime in the early morning hours.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, police would question McCrory several times. Each time, he recounted the same story about his relationship with Julie: that he’d been with her in the house Thursday night and that he hadn’t been able to reach her Friday morning. He let police search his Bronco and his apartment, but they found nothing.</p>
<p>Roughly 24 hours after Julie’s body was found, investigators took McCrory to see his dentist, Dr. William King. McCrory had consented to the dentist making a mold of his teeth for casting. King looked at McCrory’s mouth; he didn’t see any cuts or bruising on his lips or gums. McCrory seemed calm, King later testified, but he also noticed that he was shaking.</p>
<p>King, who still practices in Andalusia, remembers taking the molds from McCrory. Law enforcement agents stood by as he worked. “They didn’t ever leave my sight,” he said. He recalled being shocked when McCrory became a suspect. He was “mild-mannered,” King said, a guy he would never have imagined to be a murderer. “Of course, I’m sure everybody does that when they look back. … I just wouldn’t have guessed that.”<br />

<h2>Everybody Turned So Quick</h2>
<p>Julie McCrory was buried on June 3 in a graveside service at the Andalusia Memorial Cemetery, just two blocks away from her home. The family could see police parked nearby in unmarked cars. One of them was Andalusia police officer Howard Easley. Afterward, Easley recalled, “I stopped McCrory in his vehicle and asked if he would come with me to the Sheriff&#8217;s Department, which he did voluntarily, driving his own vehicle.”</p>
<p>Easley had also responded to the scene the day Julie was found. He recalled being put off by McCrory’s demeanor that morning. He seemed “nonchalant,” Easley said. “No emotion whatsoever.” Among law enforcement agents, suspicion over McCrory’s bearing quickly hardened into a belief in his guilt. When McCrory’s sister ReNay McCrory Smith visited him in jail the day after his arrest, she remembers the sheriff telling her, “He’s a murderer, and I don’t have any use for him.”</p>
<p>“What really put me off with Andalusia at the time is how everybody turned so quick when all this happened,” Smith said. “Here’s a guy that’d been working on the rescue squad as a volunteer all these years. … And he was an auxiliary policeman as well. And nobody stood up for him and said, ‘There&#8217;s no way this guy could have done this.’”</p>

<p>The murder shattered the town’s sense of safety. McCrory’s younger sister, Laura Grissett, who babysat Chad as a teenager, remembered Julie sometimes leaving her car running for half an hour outside when picking him up. “But after that, you just didn’t do it anymore,” she said. Their father was especially traumatized. “Daddy nailed the windows shut,” Grissett said. “He’d check under the beds before we were allowed to go in the house because he was terrified.”</p>
<p>The community was still reeling from the murder when, just over a month later, another young woman was abducted and raped not far from where Julie had been found. A man named Alton Ainsworth, who worked at Bullard Excavating, was quickly arrested and later pleaded guilty to the crime. Police questioned Ainsworth but never fully investigated him as a possible suspect in Julie’s murder — even though he was known to wear a red bandanna like the one found near her body.</p>
<p>On the day McCrory was arrested, his dental molds were transported to the state’s head medical examiner in Montgomery, along with photos of the injury Sapala believed to be a bite mark. The medical examiner called Souviron, a renowned forensic odontologist, in Coral Gables, Florida.</p>
<p>Souviron, 48, had impressive credentials — and a knack for getting good press. A style columnist once praised him alongside other “gentlemen of distinction” for a cut that gave his thinning hair “a rugged, touchable look.” In the late 1970s, as the burgeoning field of bite-mark analysis caught on nationwide, the Miami Herald published a glowing profile of Souviron titled “The Dentist as Detective: A Pioneer in Criminology.” But his biggest claim to fame was as a star witness against serial killer Ted Bundy in 1979. Newspapers printed large photos of Souviron holding a wooden pointer while presenting oversize images of Bundy’s teeth to the jury. Souviron enjoyed taking the stand. “It’s fun, it’s exciting, it’s challenging to have someone cross-examine you,” he told the Herald. “I guess it’s because I feel secure in what I testify to.”</p>
<p>Souviron told the medical examiner that he would review the evidence in Julie McCrory’s murder. On August 14, 1985, a week after receiving the dental models, photographs of Julie’s injuries, and the autopsy report, he sent a letter reporting his findings. Although only one of the 28 photographs “would be of value in making an actual one to one comparison with the models of Mr. McCrory,” he wrote, he’d found some “unusual phenomena.” McCrory’s upper left lateral incisor was missing, leaving a “seven millimeter space” between the upper left front tooth and his upper left canine. Based on these observations, he concluded, “the marks in the arm could have been made by the teeth of Mr. Charles McCrory.”</p>
<p>Souviron’s letter contained some key caveats, however. “First of all, it is impossible in my opinion, unless very unusual circumstances exist, to make a positive identification from two teeth of a bite mark,” Souviron wrote. What’s more, the photographs appeared to show only two upper teeth, which was odd since the upper jaw is fixed; the lower teeth are the ones that “grab and hold.” Further, the defense might argue that the injury could have been made by the same instrument that inflicted the puncture wounds on Julie’s chest, Souviron wrote. Ultimately, “if there is [a] substantial amount of additional evidence such as fingerprints, blood, hair, semen, etc.,” then the marks shown in the photos “would be of some value.” But if the marks were the sole means of identifying the perpetrator, he cautioned, “I feel that this is not in the best interest of justice.”</p>

<p>In other words, Souviron might be willing to say that the rather ambiguous-looking injury was a bite mark so long as plenty of other evidence implicated McCrory too.</p>
<p>This posed a problem for authorities. Despite the gruesome crime scene, no physical evidence had been linked to McCrory. Investigators never found a murder weapon. The hairs collected from the body belonged only to Julie, and while some of the random fingerprints on the furniture and kitchenware matched McCrory, that was hardly compelling given that he was often at the house on Lori Lane. As for the footprint out back, the pantyhose, and the red bandanna, no one ever figured out where they came from.</p>
<p>Still, police had found a couple of items at the home that might prove useful: a VHS tape and a collection of photographs featuring Julie and her husband in various kinky scenarios. The images were graphic and, to some, shocking. “There is more than one scene in which the young lady is — what is considered in bondage,” a defense witness testified at a pretrial hearing on August 21.</p>
<p>Although the activities depicted were consensual, prosecutors sought to introduce the tape and photos as evidence against McCrory at trial. The goal was apparently to show that McCrory had deviant sexual proclivities that escalated as he sought further gratification — or as one prosecutor put it, that “bondage sex” could lead to “stronger and stronger acts of violence.” Although defense attorneys convinced the trial judge not to allow the items into evidence, gossip soon ran rampant throughout the town. Some said Julie’s murder had been the result of some kind of sex ring.</p>
<p>One reporter who covered the trial for the Andalusia Star-News remembers “a lot of rumors, innuendo” surrounding the tape and photographs. In a “small South Alabama town, you know, deep in the heart of the Bible Belt,” those things didn’t have to make it into court to have an impact.</p>

<h2>This Set of Teeth</h2>
<p>McCrory’s trial began on October 21, 1985, at the Covington County District Court. It was less than five months after Julie’s murder. Elected District Attorney Grady Lanier was intent on moving forward quickly, even without such key evidence as a murder weapon. “When you see the blows that were on the back of her head, you didn’t need a weapon,” he said. “They spoke for themselves.” Besides, in his experience, convictions were easier to win when a crime was still fresh in a community’s mind.</p>
<p>The courtroom was packed with spectators. Representing McCrory was M.A. “Bubba” Marsal, a prominent criminal defense lawyer from Mobile whose high-profile clients included a follower of Charles Manson and a Ku Klux Klan member who’d been sent to death row. Known perhaps for his charisma more than his legal prowess, Marsal was paired with a younger local attorney named Larry Grissett (no relation to McCrory&#8217;s sister).</p>
<p>On the state’s side was an unorthodox arrangement: Rather than rely on Lanier to secure the conviction, Julie’s family had hired a local father-son legal team: personal injury attorney Frank Tipler and his son Harvey. While uncommon, hiring a private prosecutor was “not illegal” in Alabama, a 1988 report in the Montgomery Advertiser found. One lawyer told the paper it was a bad idea. “If you have the victims hiring a lawyer to prosecute a case, that lawyer will be hell-bent to send the defendant to the penitentiary … and to drag him through the mud, regardless of the amount of evidence against him.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[10](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22left%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-left" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="left"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[10] -->“I do not think we can truly have a future until all the past is dead.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[10] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[10] -->
<p>The trial transcript does not include opening or closing remarks. But the state’s theory appears to have been that McCrory had grown tired of his marriage and brutally murdered his wife to be free from her. As their first witness, prosecutors called 31-year-old Gloria Wiggins, the former co-worker with whom McCrory had recently had an affair, and asked her to read several letters the two exchanged. But apart from some tortured declarations of love, there was no evidence that McCrory was planning a future with Wiggins. In one letter, he wrote that his wife and son would always be a part of his life.</p>
<p>Rather than point this out, however, Marsal shamed Wiggins for carrying on a relationship with a married man. Most confusingly — and perhaps most damaging to his client — Marsal seized on a line from a letter Wiggins wrote shortly before Julie’s murder, asking her “to read it loud so every juror can hear it.” Wiggins read: “I do not think we can truly have a future until all the past is dead.” That line was published in the newspaper the next day.</p>
<p>Next came the investigators. With no physical evidence linking McCrory to the crime, prosecutors emphasized assorted bits of circumstantial evidence, including a question McCrory asked Treadaway, the lead investigator, hours after arriving at the scene: Had Julie died from “the lick on the back of her head”? Could a person look at Julie’s body lying on the floor and discern that there’d been a “lick” on the back of her head? Frank Tipler asked Treadaway. “I couldn’t tell,” Treadaway said. “So whoever asked it had to already know about it, didn’t they?” Tipler said.</p>
<p>On cross-examination, Marsal pointed out that “this lady was lying on the floor in a pool of blood” and “her head was crushed in, wasn’t it?” Yes, Treadaway said, but “you couldn’t see the lick on the back of the head. You could just see her head splattered open.”</p>
<p>Treadaway appeared to know shockingly little about the work that had been done to solve the case or consider alternate suspects. He did not go to Bullard Excavating and question anyone about the murder. “I don’t know who talked to them,” he testified. Nor did Treadaway know anything about the footprint found near the fence. As for Alton Ainsworth, the Bullard employee known to wear a red bandanna, “I’ve heard the name,” Treadaway said.</p>
<p>Garrett, the second investigator, testified about the eight fingerprints he took from the scene, all of which matched either Julie or McCrory. But he did not explain why he lifted prints from the Snoopy and Care Bears glasses while ignoring things like the bedroom windows and the back gate. Marsal asked about the footprint Garrett photographed outside the fence. “Did you ever attempt to compare that with any other print or shoe or any of the employees over at Bullard Construction Company?” “No, sir,” Garrett said.</p>
<p>On the second day of trial, prosecutors called Huey Dewayne Meeks, a 20-year-old with a military haircut who’d been brought back to testify during boot camp with the National Guard. Meeks was staying at his grandfather’s house, diagonal from the McCrory residence, on Friday, May 31. Although it was still dark out when he left for work at 5:15 a.m., Meeks said he noticed McCrory’s Ford Bronco parked outside. He later told his grandfather about it.</p>
<p>On cross-examination, Marsal pointed to a conflicting account Meeks had apparently given police. Didn’t he previously say he might have seen the car on a different day? Meeks admitted that he had. But he reiterated that he saw the Bronco on Friday. His testimony was bolstered by his grandfather, who testified that he too saw the Bronco that morning from his dining room.</p>

<p>The last and most important witness for the state was Souviron. Earlier that year he had helped win a death sentence against a Florida man named Robert DuBoise, who insisted on his innocence while on trial for rape and murder. At that trial, defense attorneys <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/336263644/">confronted</a> Souviron with a speech he’d made at a conference of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, in which he told the audience, “You tell me that’s the guy who did it, and I’ll go into court and say that’s the guy that did it.” Souviron said the remarks had been taken out of context.</p>
<p>Souviron testified that he’d been involved in forensic dentistry since the mid-1960s. “I have had numerous post-graduate courses, but more important I think is the fact that in those days it was a relatively new field and basically I taught most of the courses, and still do,” he said. He estimated that he had testified as an expert in at least 50 cases in up to 14 states. Prosecutors asked for him to be admitted as an expert. “No problem,” said Marsal.</p>
<p>Despite the letter Souviron had written warning that relying solely on the purported bite mark would not be “in the best interest of justice,” Souviron now said that the models and photographs were “good, quality evidence.” He documented his technique in a series of photographs, which he presented to the jury.</p>
<p>One showed a close-up of McCrory’s dental molds positioned over an enlarged photo of the alleged bite mark. “The left cuspid tooth when lined up with the bite fits into that little round puncture wound,” Souviron said. Especially important was the space between the two upper left teeth, which would usually contain another tooth, the lateral incisor. But as Souviron explained, McCrory was missing this tooth — he had been born without it.</p>
<p>Tipler asked a question that allowed Souviron to explain away the missing lower teeth. “Would you classify them as bite marks or teeth marks?” he asked. “That’s a good point,” Souviron replied. “This is not a bite mark. You have just two teeth that show here.” His conclusion: The mark on Julie’s arm “was the result of the arm being thrust into the teeth rather than the teeth being bitten into the arm.”</p>
<p>Souviron’s thrusting-arm theory appeared to conflict with the conclusions of Sapala, the medical examiner, who’d determined that the blows to Julie’s head came first, followed by the puncture injuries. The latter had been inflicted at or near her time of death, he’d found. If Julie had already suffered a mortal injury, it would have been difficult for her to thrust her arm anywhere.</p>
<p>Still, Souviron’s testimony was persuasive. King, the dentist who made McCrory’s dental molds and testified at trial, remembers being somewhat skeptical of Souviron’s analysis. But he could see how a juror would have found the testimony compelling. “If I was on the fence,” King said, “and then they threw those big enlargements of the models and the tissue photographs … and they told you ‘these match perfectly’ &#8230; it would be enough to sway you to say he’s guilty.” After all, according to Souviron, McCrory’s dentition was unique enough to make the match a near-mathematical certainty. Only 1 percent of the population would be missing a lateral incisor, he testified. “The percent of the population missing only the upper left lateral incisor is even smaller,” he said. “So my feeling is that there is a high degree of consistency between this set of teeth and those teeth marks left on the arm of Mrs. McCrory.”</p>
<p>The next day, the jury found McCrory guilty. “You have anything to say before I adjudge you guilty of murder?” the judge asked.</p>
<p>“No, sir,” McCrory said. “Other than I just did not do it.”<br />

<h2>Hour of Reckoning</h2>
<p>It was mid-afternoon when Dr. Adam Freeman was called to testify at McCrory’s evidentiary hearing in April 2021. Freeman was once a true believer in bite-mark evidence and a powerful figure within the <a href="http://abfo.org/">American Board of Forensic Odontology</a>, or ABFO, the group that certifies forensic dentists. But that had changed. Now he would be testifying for the defense — and criticizing Souviron, a former mentor.</p>
<p>For Freeman, the journey to Andalusia began on September 11, 2001. He runs a successful dental practice in Westport, Connecticut. Many of his patients commute to New York City for work, and several were killed in the attack on the World Trade Center, including one he considered a good friend. Afterward, first responders — including medical examiners and forensic dentists — combed through the rubble to identify victims. The remains of Freeman’s friend were eventually sent home in 13 separate body bags.</p>
<p>He came away from the tragedy wanting to do more. He knew disasters were inevitable. As a dentist, he felt that he could play a valuable role by helping identify victims through dental remains. “If you look at the human experience, I can think of nothing less humanized than to die and … have no identity at death,” he said. “Sort of as my tribute to our patients that were lost, I started to get involved in the forensic field.”</p>
<p>Freeman took a course in forensic pathology, where he met the president of the ABFO, who had run the dental identification unit after the Oklahoma City bombing and worked on the ground after 9/11. Freeman aspired to do the same kind of work; ambitious, with a robust ego, he was determined to become certified by the ABFO, a long and expensive process, and become one of its most elite experts. Before long he was being mentored by some of the field’s most celebrated practitioners, including Dr. David Senn, who had created a fiefdom training forensic dentists at the University of Texas at San Antonio, as well as Souviron, one of Freeman’s earliest champions.</p>
<p>While Freeman originally wanted to do dental identifications, he was quickly drawn into another aspect of the field: bite-mark analysis, or the practice of determining whether a patterned injury on a victim is the result of a bite and can be matched to the dentition of a suspected biter. Looking at images of alleged bite marks, Freeman didn’t always see what his mentors were seeing, but he would listen as they discussed their cases. “You would sit with these guys at dinner … and they would not only talk about it, but then they would be like, ‘And look, here’s my badge,’” he recalled. “‘I’m so good at this the police department or the coroner’s office gave me a badge because I’m helping protect society from these predators.’ And … at first blush, you’re like, ‘Hey, I want to be one of those — I want to be the guy that helps do that.’” In 2009, Freeman earned his certification.</p>

<p>That same year, however, bite-mark analysis was hit with the first of a series of high-profile blows. The National Academy of Sciences published a <a href="https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/228091.pdf">landmark</a><a href="https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/228091.pdf"> study of forensic practices</a> that called into question the scientific validity and reliability of nearly every discipline used to convict people and send them to prison. The majority, it found, lacked any scientific underpinning. The authors were especially rough on bite-mark matching. “Although the majority of forensic odontologists are satisfied that bite marks can demonstrate sufficient detail for positive identification,” the report read, “no scientific studies support this assessment.”</p>
<p>Bite-mark analysis rests on a two-pronged foundation. First, that human dentition is unique, like DNA, and second, that skin is a suitable substrate to accurately record that uniqueness. There is no science to back either assertion. In fact, research into the practice has generally <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2015/08/20/flawed-science-of-bite-marks/">revealed the opposite</a>: that human dentition isn’t unique and that skin — as malleable as it is — is a poor medium for preserving an accurate record of injury, all of which renders bite-mark analysis a random and purely subjective practice.</p>
<p>Freeman was rattled by the National Academy of Sciences report. But the reaction of many of his colleagues, including Senn and Souviron, was downright hostile. Over the next decade, they would lash out at their growing number of critics, even attempting to oust one of their own, a California dentist named C. Michael Bowers. Bowers had been ringing the alarm over bite-mark analysis since the late ’90s. After the National Academy of Sciences report echoed his concerns, veteran members of the ABFO concocted a dubious ethics complaint about Bowers, which they filed with the American Academy of Forensic Sciences — the nation’s preeminent umbrella organization for forensic practitioners. The attempt to destroy Bowers’s credibility failed, leading to a public meltdown in 2015, when a furious Souviron confronted the academy’s then-president, Victor Weedn, over the complaint’s dismissal: “Don’t you have any balls?” Souviron demanded. (Weedn said that Souviron later apologized for the outburst.)</p>
<p>That same year brought more trouble for the ABFO — and this time Freeman, now president of the organization, would be in the middle of it. In an attempt to impose standards for practitioners, Freeman and a colleague designed a “construct validity study” focused on the first question forensic dentists should ask: Is this a bite mark? This might seem absurdly basic, but bite-mark analysis rarely starts with ground truth — a victim in a homicide case can’t tell you that they were bitten, so whether any given injury is actually a bite mark is often unknown.<br />

“I thought this was going to be super easy,” Freeman said. He and his colleague asked board-certified members to submit images of patterned injuries they’d encountered in real casework. They posted 100 examples online and invited colleagues to review them, including one image they knew for certain was not a bite mark: It was a photo submitted by an odontologist who had injured himself while opening boxes.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[15](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[15] -->“We can’t get this basic piece right, and there are people who have been put to death in Texas based on bite marks.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[15] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[15] -->
<p>The dentists’ answers were all over the place. Sixty percent of the respondents identified the box-opening injury as a bite mark. Freeman was shocked. “The research starts coming in and … for me, it was just so seminal. It was like, wait a second,” he recalled. “We can’t get this basic piece right, and there are people who have been <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/the-murders-at-the-lake/">put to death</a> in Texas based on bite marks.”</p>
<p>Freeman was slated to present the results at the 2015 academy conference. But the results were so dismal that the researchers decided to give veteran ABFO members, like Senn, a heads up. According to Freeman, Senn asked him to rerun the study using just the answers supplied by an elite group of veterans, including himself. Freeman agreed — and the results were worse. Then Senn asked him to hold the research altogether. Freeman was adamant that they couldn’t. “And therein lies my downfall,” he said. Senn did not respond to The Intercept’s requests for comment.</p>
<p>Like Bowers before him, Freeman soon found himself the subject of a questionable ethics complaint; it also failed. But it was a turning point for Freeman. He’d seen the truth, he said: Bite-mark analysis was bunk, and he worried about the people it had sent to prison. In 2020, Freeman penned his official resignation from the ABFO. “In my opinion, we have an absolute duty, and ethical obligation to correct our past mistakes,” he wrote. “Diplomates have participated in far too many wrongful convictions resulting in hundreds of years of wrongfully convicted people in prison.”</p>
<h2>Their Own Junk Science</h2>
<p>In his testimony at McCrory’s hearing, Freeman did not mince words: Souviron had gotten it wrong back at trial. There was no scientific basis for his presumption that the two marks found on Julie’s arm were made by teeth, nor for his conclusion that McCrory’s supposedly unique dentition had made the marks.</p>
<p>And it turns out that Souviron now agrees. “I no longer believe, as I did at the time of trial, that there is a valid scientific basis for concluding that the injury found on the skin of the victim … could be ‘matched’ or otherwise connected to a specific individual, such as Mr. McCrory,” Souviron wrote in his 2019 recantation. “I therefore renounce that testimony.”</p>
<p>Freeman told the court that he was familiar with “several cases” Souviron had gotten wrong over the years. Fabricant, the Innocence Project lawyer, had already mentioned two — including that of DuBoise, the Florida man whom Souviron helped send to death row just months before testifying against McCrory. After decades behind bars, DuBoise was <a href="https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/casedetail.aspx?caseid=5807">finally exonerated</a> in August 2020.</p>
<p>“Dr. Souviron is a friend. I take absolutely no pleasure in criticizing a man who has helped mentor me, who has championed me, and who quite honestly as a person, I like,” Freeman said. “This is a very uncomfortable position to be put in.”</p>
<p>“And so why are you doing it?” Fabricant asked.</p>
<p>“Because it’s the right thing to do,” he replied.</p>
<p>Freeman said that he didn’t think the marks on Julie’s arm were made by teeth. There was a similar-looking injury near Julie’s armpit that everyone had just ignored. He also noted that it didn’t make sense that a bite mark would be left solely by two upper teeth: “It is almost impossible to create a mark … where you’d only see upper teeth.”</p>
<p>Regardless, the idea that the marks could be matched to anyone in particular was ludicrous. “With just two marks,” Freeman said, “if I had the dental lineup of his Honor and you and anybody else in this courtroom, I would likely make those fit those two marks.”</p>

<p>Freeman was not alone in his opinion. Also testifying was Dr. Cynthia Brzozowski, a veteran dentist from New York who has been involved in forensics since the early ’90s. When she was starting out, she was “led to believe” that bite-mark analysis was “based on valid science,” she said. Now, like Freeman, she felt she had an “ethical and civic responsibility” to testify in cases like McCrory’s. She agreed that there was no way to conclude that the marks on Julie’s arm were made by teeth in the first place, let alone McCrory’s teeth.</p>
<p>Jeter, the prosecutor, tried to draw a distinction between analyzing a bite mark and analyzing teeth marks, suggesting that what Souviron had done in the McCrory case wasn’t actually bite-mark analysis. Brzozowski was firm: “We don’t have criteria for teeth marks,” she said.</p>
<p>As Jeter went on, she tried to rehabilitate the state’s case by eliciting agreement that Souviron’s testimony was perfectly proper by 1985 “standards” — even though whatever standards did exist back then have been thoroughly disavowed. And then she insinuated that Souviron hadn’t really recanted his trial testimony. Jeter noted that when interviewed by an investigator from the district attorney’s office, Souviron said he still believed that the wound on Julie’s arm was made by teeth, but he would not testify now with the same “high degree of certainty” that they were McCrory’s teeth. Fabricant objected; the state hadn’t called Souviron as a witness, so inserting this thirdhand assertion into evidence was improper. But the judge allowed it.</p>
<p>In fact, Souviron told The Intercept that he didn’t say the things Jeter was ascribing to him. He said he’d been subpoenaed but that the state released him from the obligation prior to the hearing. His interview with the Andalusia law enforcement official had been recorded, he added, so it should be easy to disprove Jeter’s account. “She’s wasting her time,” he said. “If that’s the best she can do, forget it.”</p>
<p>As it turned out, that was about the best Jeter could do. When it was her turn to present evidence that McCrory’s conviction should be upheld, Jeter deployed an odd strategy: She called the DA’s investigator as a witness, and the two of them read into evidence cherry-picked segments from the 1985 trial transcript. Over an objection from Loudon-Brown, McCrory’s lawyer, who pointed out that the judge already had the full record, they included police investigator Billy Treadaway’s description of McCrory asking about the “lick” on the back of Julie’s head. Notably, Jeter omitted Treadaway’s subsequent acknowledgment that it was clear Julie’s head had been “splattered open.”</p>
<p>The point was to portray the original case against McCrory as more substantial than it was and thus able to stand even without Souviron’s definitive testimony. Wrapping up her case, Jeter called the state’s only actual witness at the hearing: Meeks, the National Guard trainee who claimed that he saw McCrory’s Bronco while standing outside his grandfather’s house in the dark almost 36 years earlier.</p>
<p>Now in his late 50s, Meeks had taken off work to appear in court and did not seem happy to be there. But instead of asking him questions about what he’d allegedly seen back in 1985, Jeter asked Meeks to read his previous testimony into the record. Loudon-Brown was quick to protest: “He’s a live witness. He needs to testify from personal knowledge, not some words on a paper.” But again, the judge let Jeter proceed. It did not go well. After Jeter read the questions Meeks was asked at trial, Meeks seemed confused. He abandoned his trial testimony and began answering as if he was being asked the questions anew. Jeter repeatedly cut him off and tried to get him back on script before the judge finally interrupted, changed his previous ruling, and brought the whole sideshow to an end. Before dismissing Meeks, Jeter asked him a single question: Did he stand by his trial testimony? “Yes, ma’am,” he replied.</p>
<p>In closing, Loudon-Brown homed in on the key role that Souviron played in McCrory’s conviction. All the state had was an assortment of weak circumstantial evidence that didn’t add up to much until Souviron got on the stand. “That right there sealed his fate,” Loudon-Brown said. “It was identification testimony. And now that dentist who offered that testimony has said that’s not true.”</p>
<p>He called the judge’s attention to a poster board featuring photos of some of the dozens of individuals wrongfully convicted based on junk bite-mark evidence. “There was evidence at every single one of those peoples’ trials sufficient to convict that person at trial,” he said. “This case is different in one way: There is no other evidence that implicates Mr. McCrory.”</p>
<p>When it was her turn to address the judge, Jeter noted that a conviction could stand on circumstantial evidence alone and that even without Souviron’s expert testimony the jurors could have drawn “reasonable inferences” that McCrory had killed his wife. With that, she launched into a sprawling, fever-dream narrative built wholly on speculation. She suggested that the letters McCrory had exchanged with Wiggins were evidence of a “web of deceit he had woven” and that he needed a way out. The jurors could have concluded that McCrory’s having honked his horn as he left Julie and Chad in the doorway the last evening they were together was “the beginning of his alibi,” Jeter said, a way of announcing to the neighborhood that he was leaving, “that he would not be there when she was murdered later.”</p>
<p>As Jeter’s story rose to a crescendo, she stopped referring to the jurors at all. She described how McCrory had continued his ruse the following morning by calling around pretending to look for Julie when he knew exactly where she was. “He knew she was not answering the phone because she was dead. And he knew that his … child was essentially at home alone, completely unsupervised, with his dead mother,” she said. “But of course, he wouldn’t want to be the first one on the scene. He needed somebody else to find her,” so he tricked his dad into going to the house on Lori Lane.</p>
<p>Jeter eventually turned back to the bite mark, noting that under state law, the jurors could’ve taken the molds of McCrory’s teeth and the photos of Julie’s injury and physically compared them for themselves. “And Judge, they could well have done that with or without Dr. Souviron’s testimony,” she said.</p>
<p>In response, Loudon-Brown noted that the jurors weren’t “allowed to engage in their own junk science.”<br />

<h2>No Winners</h2>
<p>The hearing concluded around 6 p.m. Lawyers were given a deadline to submit post-hearing briefs. Beyond that, there was no way to know when the judge would rule.</p>
<p>The next day, Keith Harward sat at a picnic table at a campground and RV park a few miles from downtown Andalusia. He’d traveled for the hearing on behalf of the Innocence Project, only to be kicked out of the courtroom after an angry outburst. “I should know better,” he said. But he couldn’t stand listening to a prosecutor malign a man who had already lost so much of his life to junk science. It reminded him too much of his own case.</p>
<p>Harward spent 34 years behind bars in Virginia after being wrongfully accused of rape and murder on the basis of bite-mark evidence. Now 65, with long white hair and a ZZ Top beard, he had 10-29-83, the date of his conviction, tattooed on his back. Under that was his exoneration date: 4-7-16.</p>
<p>Harward is blunt about the trauma inflicted by his wrongful conviction. “I have all kinds of issues,” he said. To this day, he does not keep glassware in his house. “We didn’t have it in prison,” he said. “I’m afraid of breaking it, getting cut.” And he remains haunted by a sense that his case is never far behind him. “Every day I get up, I&#8217;m still waiting for someone to come say, ‘Oh, we made a mistake.’”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[18](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[18] -->“Every day I get up, I’m still waiting for someone to come say, ‘Oh, we made a mistake.’”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[18] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[18] -->
<p>Harward’s fate might easily have been different. It was only because of the Innocence Project’s ability to secure new evidence testing in his case that DNA emerged pointing to the real perpetrator, which convinced the Virginia attorney general to support Harward’s exoneration. Like most people convicted of crimes based on junk science, McCrory did not have DNA evidence on his side.</p>
<p>Had the physical evidence in his case been preserved, McCrory might well have been able to clear his name. Several years ago, McCrory’s son, Chad, got access to the evidence room at the courthouse, where he recalled seeing a bag with fingernail clippings, as well as a nightgown, presumably the one his mother had been wearing when she was killed. Chad later told his father’s trial attorney Larry Grissett, who thought the materials might reveal DNA. But when Grissett visited the evidence room himself, the items were gone. Only the dental mold remained.</p>
<p>A few months after the evidentiary hearing, in July 2021, Lanier, the former Covington County DA, arrived at Grissett&#8217;s law office in downtown Opp, some 15 miles west of Andalusia. A buck’s head was mounted on the wall opposite a fireplace topped with family photos. Lanier had brought a box of freshly baked donuts, which he shared with his former adversary. Although they had been on opposite sides of McCrory’s trial in 1985, the lawyers agreed on at least one thing. No matter how the judge might rule now, “there are no winners,” Grissett said. “No, there are no winners,” Lanier said. “And the community lost — they lost a good man and, of course, a good woman.”</p>
<p>Now in his late 70s, Lanier wore sneakers and flip-up shades over his prescription eyeglasses. He’d lost reelection shortly after McCrory’s conviction, following a tenure marked by his own run-ins with the law. In 1987 Lanier was convicted of assaulting a state trooper who pulled him over for reckless driving. But the former DA’s record paled in comparison to that of Harvey Tipler, one of the private prosecutors who convicted McCrory. After being jailed in Florida on multiple charges, including racketeering and prostitution for soliciting sex from clients, Tipler was convicted in 2013 for trying to have a state prosecutor murdered. He’s currently serving 30 years in prison.</p>
<p>“I have a clear conscience,” Lanier said. It was the Tiplers who’d handled the bite-mark evidence, he added. Regardless, he said he still believed in McCrory’s guilt. But Grissett felt differently. All these decades later, he remained disturbed by the case. “I think about it a lot, and it worries me,” he said. Grissett doesn’t believe that Ainsworth, the Bullard employee who was convicted of rape, was the real killer. But he was adamant that there were alternate leads and suspects that remain unexplored.</p>
<p>Grissett remained indignant over Souviron’s role at trial. “Listen, not only was that junk science, but Dr. Souviron was untruthful,” he said. As Grissett recalled, he and his co-counsel, Marsal, had asked Souviron just before he testified whether he could truly claim definitively that the mark matched McCrory’s teeth. Souviron said no. But when he got on the stand moments later, Souviron essentially said the opposite. The trial transcript supports Grissett’s recollection. An agitated Marsal had confronted Souviron. “Did you not tell us during the break that you could not tell if these teeth marks were made by Charles McCrory?” he demanded. Souviron said he’d told them it was “not positive for Charles McCrory.” He could not exclude everyone else in the world. “We were shocked,” Grissett said.</p>
<p>On February 14, 2022, Judge Short finally handed down his ruling. It adopted verbatim the state’s proposed order, which argued that McCrory would have been convicted even without Souviron’s testimony. The ruling cited the eyewitness testimony from Meeks and his grandfather, along with McCrory’s questions about the “lick” on the back of Julie’s head. Perhaps most preposterously, the judge endorsed the argument that jurors at McCrory’s trial could have done their own bite-mark analysis. “The jury could have made the physical comparison between the injury to the victim’s arm and the mold of the defendant’s teeth on their own,” Short wrote.</p>
<p>Grissett was unsurprised by the ruling. “There was no way the judge was gonna grant this,” he said. “I mean, he’s a really good guy, he is. But he is really, really conservative.” In Alabama, judges are elected, he pointed out. “So, you know, they&#8217;re politicians also.”</p>
<p>Still, Grissett flatly rejected the notion that jurors would have convicted McCrory. “There was not enough evidence to find him guilty without Souviron. That&#8217;s the only evidence that directly connected him.” As for the idea that the jurors could do their own forensic analysis, let alone apply junk science, “it’s ludicrous,” he said.</p>
<p>Grissett is not alone in his opinion. Just a few weeks after the 2021 hearing, Loudon-Brown met with Harvey Tipler in prison. In a subsequent court filing, he wrote that in Tipler’s recollection, “the bite mark evidence ‘clearly was’ the reason for the conviction, and his father, Frank Tipler, thought so too.” Tipler also told Loudon-Brown that Jeter’s theory of the crime was not the one they presented at trial. For them, the bite mark was “key,” he said.</p>
<p>In a statement, Fabricant and Loudon-Brown called the decision “a tragic failure of law.” They will appeal to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals. “Almost 10 months after the evidentiary hearing at which all experts agreed the injury to the decedent was <em>not</em> a bite mark, the judge signed four pages of findings written by the prosecutors and denied a new trial,&#8221; they said. &#8220;This was despite the prosecution’s own expert recanting his trial testimony and admitting, in agreement with the entirety of the scientific community, that this kind of evidence has no place in the criminal courts.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Dr. Thomas Young</u> is adamant: Melissa Lucio should not be put to death.</p>
<p>“This would be a horrible, horrible tragedy if she ends up getting executed over this,” he said. “It’s just not right.”</p>
<p>Young is a veteran forensic pathologist and the former chief medical examiner in Kansas City, Missouri. For years he has sounded the alarm about forensic science practices that lead to wrongful convictions, with a focus on faulty inferences in death investigations. He said that’s exactly what happened in Lucio’s case.</p>
<p>Lucio has been on Texas’s death row since 2008 for killing her 2-year-old daughter, Mariah. According to the state, Lucio repeatedly abused the toddler until she finally succumbed to her injuries. The problem, says Young, who first reviewed the case at the behest of Lucio’s post-conviction attorney, is that the medical examiner who conducted Mariah’s autopsy, and then offered unequivocal trial testimony that blamed Lucio for her daughter’s death, got it wrong. That pathologist, Young said, appears to have jumped to conclusions while ignoring evidence that pointed toward Mariah’s death being the result of an accident.</p>
<p>“You develop a belief and come hell or high water you’re going to defend your belief,” Young said. This happens all too often in forensic pathology and forensic science in general, he added.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>The state’s case against Lucio was weak but ultimately devastating. Instead of conducting an investigation into what happened to Mariah, police in the Rio Grande Valley city of Harlingen hauled Lucio in for a marathon interrogation the night her child died and aggressively pushed her to confess. Jurors at her trial were shown a video of the more than five-hour confrontation and heard from cops who insisted that Lucio wasn’t behaving like a grieving mother. They were also shown numerous photos of Mariah’s body, which was horribly bruised. The pathologist, Dr. Norma Jean Farley, said there was no doubt that Mariah was a battered child.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the defense failed to call witnesses who could have questioned the state’s assumptions about Mariah’s death or offered an alternative explanation for her injuries.</p>
<p>Farley did not respond to The Intercept’s requests for comment, nor did Peter Gilman, Lucio’s lead attorney at trial.</p>
<p>The case came at a pivotal time for embattled Cameron County District Attorney Armando Villalobos, who used Lucio’s trial to boost his tough-on-crime reputation as part of his reelection campaign. The DA, who would go on to win that November, would be known as the man who sent the first Latina woman to Texas’s death row.</p>
<p>Lucio’s case is an example of the kind of rush to judgment that often follows the untimely death of a child. A parent or caretaker perceived to be unfit can easily turn into a criminal suspect; authorities are especially quick to judge poor people of color — especially women who are stereotyped as bad mothers.</p>
<p>If Mariah died as the result of an accident, as Young believes, that means Lucio, who has always maintained her innocence, is sitting on death row for a crime that never happened. Since 1989, at least 70 women have been exonerated for murders they did not commit, according to the <a href="https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/about.aspx" target="_blank">National Registry of Exonerations</a>. In 31 cases, no crime was ever committed; nearly half of those involved child victims.</p>

<p>Lucio’s case also reflects how Texas courts routinely ignore evidence of innocence in order to carry out the death penalty. After Lucio’s conviction was <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/federal-appeals-court-overturns-mothers-conviction-in-texas-child-murder-case-that-may-have-been-an-accidental-death" target="_blank">overturned</a> by a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, which found that the trial court violated her right to present a complete defense by barring the testimony of two witnesses, prosecutors successfully appealed, convincing the same court to <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/divided-federal-appeals-court-reinstates-death-sentence-for-texas-mother-of-child-who-may-have-died-in-accidental-fall" target="_blank">reinstate</a> Lucio’s conviction in 2021. In January, the state set an execution date of April 27.</p>
<p>With Lucio’s execution date approaching, anti-death penalty organizers have joined her family in the Rio Grande Valley in a campaign to save her life. Activists have held public screenings of a 2020 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/State-Texas-vs-Melissa/dp/B08KGR4K4P" target="_blank">documentary</a> film about Lucio, “The State of Texas vs. Melissa,” which revealed crucial evidence that was never used at trial. Meanwhile, the Innocence Project is calling on the Cameron County district attorney to <a href="https://innocenceproject.org/petitions/urge-saenz-to-withdraw-execution-melissa-lucio/?p2asource=twp_02182022">withdraw Lucio’s execution date</a> and conduct a review of her case. If the efforts are unsuccessful, Lucio will become the seventh woman executed in Texas and the first in nearly a decade.</p>
<p>“I’ve been doing capital defense work in Texas for 30 years now,” said Sandra Babcock, a Cornell Law School professor and founder of the Cornell Center on the Death Penalty Worldwide. “And this is by far the weakest capital case I’ve ever seen.”</p>

<h2>No Third Choice</h2>
<p>Like many people who end up on death row, Lucio had a life marked by trauma and abuse. Molested by multiple men when she was just a kid, she longed to get out of her mother’s home. She married at 16 and the next year had her first child. According to court filings, Lucio’s husband was violent toward her; after he abandoned her, she got involved with a man named Robert Alvarez, who was also abusive. By the time Mariah was born in September 2004, Lucio already had 11 children. She was living in poverty and struggling with drug addiction. After she tested positive for cocaine following Mariah’s birth, Texas’s child welfare agency placed her kids in foster care.</p>
<p>Over the next two years, Lucio worked to meet the state’s family reunification plan and regained custody of nine of her children. (The three oldest children went to live with their father, Lucio’s first husband, in Houston.) The family’s caseworker, who visited the home regularly, described a chaotic atmosphere. Lucio’s teenage daughters were often in charge of supervising their siblings. But the caseworker reported no signs that Lucio physically abused her children. In fact, relatives and friends recall her being patient with her kids; one of Lucio’s sisters testified that she used to get exasperated at how passive Lucio was when it came to discipline.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[3] -->
<p>The family was crammed into a two-bedroom apartment in a shabby brick building in Harlingen. Their unit was on the second floor, which required walking up a rickety flight of stairs constructed of varying rise. In one report, the family’s caseworker expressed concern after seeing Mariah’s 3-year-old sister navigating the steps without supervision. For Mariah, who wore special shoes because of a congenital foot deformity, the staircase was particularly hazardous. The family had plans to move to a first-floor apartment in a nicer building just blocks away.</p>
<p>As Lucio later told police, on Thursday, February 15, 2007, she was busy readying the apartment for the move. Alvarez had taken three of the kids to drop off a load of belongings at the new place. Although he’d told the younger kids to stay inside, once he left, they made their way down the staircase to play in the yard, leaving Mariah upstairs. Lucio said she was packing clothes and housewares when she realized that Mariah was no longer inside; she found her lying at the bottom of the staircase crying, with some blood by her lower teeth.</p>
<p>Mariah seemed mostly uninjured by the fall, Lucio said. But over the next 48 hours, there were signs that she apparently failed to appreciate. First, Mariah threw up after eating some tamales; although she ate Cocoa Krispies for breakfast the next day, the child eventually lost her appetite, asking only for juice at dinner. Mariah also appeared to be having some trouble breathing, which Lucio thought was due to a cold. By Saturday, Mariah was lethargic. Now settling into their new apartment, Lucio put the toddler on a mattress in one of the bedrooms, pulled a blanket up over her, and asked the other children to let her sleep. When Alvarez got home early that evening, he checked on Mariah and immediately called for Lucio; Mariah was not breathing.</p>
<p>It was around 7 p.m. when the family called 911. Paramedics arrived and tried to resuscitate Mariah to no avail. They rushed her to the emergency room of a local hospital. She was dead. The first responders and ER doctor were suspicious. Lucio was sitting near Mariah’s head when the paramedics arrived, but she wasn’t doing anything, they reported. She told them that Mariah had fallen down the stairs but not that it had occurred at their previous apartment. They didn’t buy it; the new apartment had just three steps leading up to the front door.</p>
<p>When the paramedics cut off Mariah’s clothes, they were stunned to see a constellation of bruises. The doctor concluded that Mariah had been severely abused. “This is the absolute worst that I’ve ever seen,” he said.</p>
<p>Police took Lucio directly from the hospital to the police station, installed her in a cramped office, set up a video recorder, and just before 10 p.m. began their interrogation.</p>
<p>A tag team of five investigators pressed Lucio, trying to get her to admit that she had killed her daughter. Although one of the Harlingen Police Department investigators, Rebecca Cruz, later testified that at that point the cops had “no evidence” Lucio had harmed Mariah, they told her that they knew Mariah had been beaten to death. “If I beat you half to death like that little child was beat, I bet you’d die too,” investigator Jesus Banda yelled.</p>
<p>Police told her there were only two options: Either she’d abused Mariah but hadn’t intended to kill her or she was a murderer. “There is no third choice here,” one of them said. Maybe she hadn’t meant to do it and was just “frustrated” by all her responsibilities, they suggested. Although Lucio laid out her story about Mariah falling down the stairs, they brushed it aside, claiming that there was no way a fall could have caused her death or the numerous bruises found on her body.</p>

<p>For more than five hours, Lucio sat in a metal office chair wedged into a corner, alternately crying, yawning, and resting her head on the desk as the cops urged her to tell the “truth.” Still, she did not relent, repeatedly telling them that she did not beat Mariah and didn’t know how she’d died. “How are you going to change our minds and prove that you’re not a cold-blooded killer?” one investigator asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how to change your minds,” Lucio replied.</p>
<p>Eventually a new face appeared: Texas Ranger Victor Escalon. Part of the state police, the Rangers often assist smaller jurisdictions in the investigation of major crimes. While they have generally enjoyed a larger-than-life mythology in Texas, the Rangers have a history marked by <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/08/15/texas-rangers-racist-violent-history/">racism and brutality</a>. Wearing his gun in a leather holster and the iconic white cowboy hat that is synonymous with the agency, Escalon leaned in toward Lucio. He was there, it seemed, to turn the screw. “Look at me,” he told her. The truth is hard, but she had to tell him. “It’s gonna help you,” he continued. People would understand.</p>
<p>Lucio cried as he showed her pictures of Mariah’s body. She’d spanked Mariah before, she told Escalon, “but I didn’t think I would spank her to where … it got to this point.” She was responsible, she told him. But when he pressed, she continued to say that she didn’t know how Mariah had died. Had Lucio suffocated her? Poisoned her? Hit her in the head? No, Lucio responded. Escalon brought in a white baby doll dressed in a pink jumper. He placed it facedown on the desk and asked her to show him how she’d spanked Mariah. She thumped the doll on its backside. Escalon slapped his leg harder. Was it like that? He instructed her to hit the doll again. Why’d she do it? he asked. “Frustration, I guess,” Lucio replied.</p>
<p>“What’s going through your head?” Escalon asked just before ending the interrogation at 3:15 a.m. “I wish it was me there and not her,” Lucio replied through tears.</p>
<p>Lucio was arrested and charged with capital murder. That evening, Judge Luis Saenz set her bond at $2 million. She would never go home again.</p>
<p>The following day, Farley, the chief pathologist for Cameron and Hidalgo counties, conducted the autopsy. Cruz, the police interrogator, stood nearby as Farley looked at Mariah’s bruised body. Trial records indicate that before Farley even cut into the body, she’d already made up her mind. “This child was severely abused,” she later testified. “I mean, it would have been evident to a first-year nursing student.” The internal examination would be important, she said, “to figure out which slap, hit, or throw killed the child.”</p>

<h2>“A Normal Parent”</h2>
<p>Lucio went to trial in the summer of 2008 at the Cameron County Courthouse in downtown Brownsville, just a few blocks from the international bridge to Matamoros, Mexico.</p>
<p>The trial came as Villalobos, the Cameron County district attorney, was desperate to rehabilitate his reputation to win reelection. After unseating the incumbent DA amid promises to restore leadership to the office, Villalobos had been accused of <a href="https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/South-Texas-DA-indicted-in-bribery-and-kickback-3541102.php">corruption</a> following a highly irregular plea deal with a man who’d murdered a woman on South Padre Island. The defendant was allowed 60 days “to get his affairs in order,” only to flee the country; Villalobos’s primary opponent bashed him for the deal while also decrying the DA’s handling of child abuse cases. In a full-page newspaper ad, Villalobos’s rival tallied more than 100 cases from 2007 in which defendants had never been prosecuted. “ARMANDO VILLALOBOS IS AGAINST OUR CHILDREN,” it read.</p>
<p>Representing Lucio was Gilman, a local lawyer who’d previously run for district attorney himself. Gilman was appointed to the case despite never having handled a death penalty trial. Although Texas had undertaken a series of reforms aimed at bolstering the quality of capital defense, large swaths of the state remained ill-equipped to manage the unique burdens of a death penalty prosecution. In Cameron County, the lack of experienced lawyers created lengthy trial delays. As Villalobos told the Valley Morning Star in 2006, “The list of available qualified death penalty attorneys is very short.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[8](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A4%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="4"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[8] -->
<p>Lucio was in jail for three months before Gilman was appointed to her case. As she describes it in the documentary, he encouraged her to plead guilty in exchange for a 30-year sentence offered by the DA. “And I said no right away because I wasn’t guilty,” Lucio said. To Assistant District Attorney Alfredo Padilla, that decision sealed her fate. “If she was arrogant enough” to think “‘I can explain my way out of it,’” Padilla told the filmmakers, “then she has nobody to blame but herself.”</p>
<p>Padilla gave the opening statement at trial. He avoided the question of precisely how Lucio had killed Mariah by casting the toddler’s death as the violent culmination of “a cruel and brutal life” at the hands of her mother. The vagueness of the state’s theory was reflected in the indictment, which Padilla read aloud. It charged Lucio with causing Mariah’s death “by striking or shaking or throwing” the child using her “hand, foot, or other object.”</p>
<p>The first day of trial was mostly spent playing the video of Lucio’s interrogation, which the state repeatedly called a “confession.” Although the defense pushed back against the label, Gilman conceded in his opening statement that Lucio was guilty of “injury to a child.”</p>
<p>Prosecutors called an array of witnesses who described Lucio as showing insufficient distress over the death of her child. She did not behave like “a normal parent,” one paramedic testified. Another said that “she was extremely calm for the situation,” behavior “so far out of the ordinary that I put it into the report.” Cruz, one of the police investigators, said Lucio looked “relieved” after her daughter’s death. “There was no emotion,” she said.</p>
<p>Escalon, the Texas Ranger, was especially adamant that Lucio’s demeanor told him all he needed to know. From the moment he walked into the interview room, he testified, he knew that “she had done something.” Innocent people fight back, he explained. “They’re going to tell you, ‘Get out of my face. I didn’t do anything. Leave me alone. I want my attorney.’” But Lucio remained slouched over, avoiding eye contact — a classic sign that someone is “hiding the truth.”</p>
<p>At least one juror interviewed by The Intercept drew similar conclusions from Lucio’s flat expression in court. If she were on trial for something she hadn’t done, the juror said, she would have loudly protested: “‘Hey, Judge, I’ve got something to say.’ … Because I’m not about to lose my life over something that I know I did not do.” But Lucio “didn’t seem to care.” The juror, who wished to remain anonymous because she still lives in the community, had “no doubt” about Lucio’s guilt. “A child does not get that beat up just because,” she said. She was especially struck by the photos of Mariah’s bruised body. “That was the most difficult part for us to see. And to get that image out of your head.”</p>
<p>When it came to how, exactly, Mariah might have sustained such bruises, however, the state’s case was nonexistent. There were no witnesses who ever saw Lucio strike her child. Nor did any of the voluminous child welfare records document any past physical abuse. Yet state witnesses speculated freely about the many ways Lucio might have brutalized her daughter. At one point, after Escalon testified that Mariah might have been violently shaken, Villalobos asked him to demonstrate, which Escalon did, shaking the district attorney by his shoulders. The child was so frail that it would not have taken much for her to “fall apart,” Escalon said.</p>

<p>But the most crucial testimony came from Farley, the medical examiner. A seasoned trial witness, she apologized to the court reporter for talking too fast. “I get in trouble for that all the time,” she said. After a lengthy discussion of Mariah’s external injuries, Farley turned to the autopsy. It had taken six hours, she said, which was longer than most, “because of the number of contusions and abrasions on the body.” Contusions “don’t normally kill you,” she explained, but they are “a sign that a child has been beaten.” In addition to the external bruises, Farley said she found contusions to Mariah’s lungs and kidneys, which were consistent with “punches or stomps — or slams.” She also noted an older, partially healed fracture in Mariah’s arm, which “just gives us more evidence of a battered child syndrome.”</p>
<p>Farley explained that the cause of death was a blow to the head that had caused a subdural hemorrhage, in which blood fills the space between the brain and the skull. Such injuries required significant force, she said, although her explanation remained vague. “Basically the head is going one direction and it hits something,” she said, referring to the brain. “And when it stops, it bounces off of it. And it’s that force that causes this kind of injury to a child.”</p>
<p>Farley estimated that Mariah’s head injury had occurred 24 hours before her death, on Friday, February 16. Could a child with such an injury be able to “sit up, eat Cocoa Krisps, and things of that nature?” Padilla asked, referencing the cereal Lucio said her daughter ate the morning after she fell down the stairs. No, Farley said. “Usually with this kind of hemorrhage, the child has some type of immediate sign,” she said. “Most of the time, they say they’re very tired.” But as the brain swells, they will also vomit or have respiratory issues. “It’s usually fairly quickly after the fatal blow occurs that they’ll start to have the symptoms.”</p>
<p>The symptoms Farley listed were consistent with what Lucio had described in the 48 hours after Mariah fell down the stairs. But Farley rejected the notion that Mariah could have died from a fall. “This child had more bruises than I’ve ever seen in any case that I had before,” she said. “This is a beating.”</p>
<p>On July 8, 2008, Lucio was convicted of capital murder. Two days later she was sentenced to die.</p>

<h2>Discarded Evidence</h2>
<p>Lucio had been on death row for almost four years when the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2012/06/13/death-sentence-reversed-for-2005-murder-case/" target="_blank">threw out</a> the death sentence of a different Cameron County defendant who had been convicted of killing his girlfriend’s 1-year-old son. Manuel Velez, a construction worker with an intellectual disability, was sentenced to death just months after Lucio.</p>
<p>As in Lucio’s case, Farley was the state’s star witness against Velez; she testified that the child had died after being “struck, thrown against a surface, or beat about the head.” Especially crucial was her insistence that the child’s fatal injury had been sustained no earlier than two weeks before his death. But according to evidence that later came to light, the fatal injury had occurred between 18 and 36 days prior to the child’s death, a period during which Velez was working a job in Tennessee, more than 1,000 miles away.</p>
<p>In fact, Farley had been provided medical records that showed the child had a history of head injuries dating back months. But these documents were apparently ignored, one of several parallels with Lucio’s case. “She never looked at Mariah’s medical records,” said Vanessa Potkin, director of special litigation at the Innocence Project. “There was never a consideration of any medical history, which included other falls.”</p>
<p>It would be another two years before Velez was <a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/manuel-velez-v-state-texas" target="_blank">released</a> from prison. In the meantime, appellate lawyers for Lucio became convinced that she too had been wrongly convicted. In 2010, Margaret Schmucker was appointed to represent Lucio in her state post-conviction proceedings. It was immediately clear to her that there were profound problems with the case.</p>
<p>Some of the most disturbing revelations came from a mitigation specialist at trial named Norma Villanueva. In 2011, she signed a five-page affidavit saying that Gilman, Lucio’s defense attorney, had deliberately hamstrung her efforts. He’d barred her from speaking to Lucio’s family — the most crucial part of mitigation work — until jury selection began, which was far too late to compile the thorough research her job required. Even more unsettling, she said that Gilman had refused to pursue exculpatory evidence that could have saved his client’s life.</p>
<p>According to Villanueva, one of Lucio’s teenage daughters, Alexandra, had admitted during a family meeting in June 2008 that she “was the reason Mariah fell down the stairs.” This was potentially powerful evidence. Yet according to Villanueva, “this information was simply disregarded and never utilized in any manner.” In fact, she said she was told by Gilman “not to disclose this information to anyone.”</p>
<p>The possibility that the teenager might have been responsible for Mariah’s injuries was explored in the documentary about Lucio’s case. One private investigator hired by Schmucker told the filmmakers that when she&#8217;d confronted Gilman about his refusal to pursue the evidence, he said he didn’t want to ruin the teenager’s life. Although in the film Alexandra denied ever harming Mariah, others have corroborated Villanueva’s account. In a 2010 affidavit, one of Lucio’s sisters recounted a different conversation involving several relatives in which Alexandra had tearfully admitted to punching Mariah, evidently out of resentment for having to care for her while Lucio and her husband did drugs.</p>
<p>To the juror, who watched the film shortly after it came out, this alternate theory was unconvincing. “If it was true that the daughter is the one that pushed her, how come she never made mention of it?” the juror asked. Gilman, after all, told jurors at the start of the trial that Lucio was guilty of “injury to a child.” The juror said she was stunned upon watching the film to discover that Lucio insisted on her innocence at all.</p>
<p>With so many kids around, someone would have seen it if Mariah fell down the stairs, the juror pointed out. Indeed, the film includes clips of interviews conducted at Maggie’s House, a child welfare center in Cameron County, where a counselor spoke to two of Lucio’s sons a few days after Mariah died. “She fell down some steps,” 9-year-old Rene said when asked if anything had happened to his little sister. Did somebody tell him that’s what happened? “No, I saw,” he answered. His brother Richard told the same counselor that he had not seen any bruises on Mariah aside from the ones she got “when she fell down the steps.”</p>
<p>The children’s accounts could have provided key corroborating evidence for the theory. But in his own interview for the film, Gilman was dismissive. “I didn’t feel like any of the children would be helpful,” he said, citing their behavioral problems. He doubted whether they could have appeared in court “without getting up and running around the courtroom thinking, ‘This is great.’”</p>
<p>Immediately following Lucio’s trial, Gilman was hired as a prosecutor in the Cameron County District Attorney’s Office, where he works to this day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Villalobos, the former DA, is due to be released from federal custody in 2025 after being convicted on a slew of corruption charges. Five years after Villalobos sent Lucio to death row, jurors found him guilty of accepting more than $100,000 in exchange for “favorable acts of prosecutorial discretion.” In an interview with the documentary filmmakers, one of the prosecutors who tried the case cited Villalobos’s work on other capital cases as a cause for concern. “Every single one of those cases should be examined,” he said.</p>

<h2>Room for Bias</h2>
<p>Despite the red flags, Lucio’s case has mostly evaded careful scrutiny. While the 5th Circuit briefly overturned her conviction, the courts have all but ignored the alleged evidence that sent her to death row: Farley’s autopsy and the police interrogation. And that evidence, experts say, was wholly unreliable.</p>
<p>Young, the forensic pathologist, was first asked by Schmucker to review the medical evidence against Lucio as part of her state post-conviction appeal. In a December 2010 report, Young concluded that the child’s cause of death was “blunt head injury, delayed effects” and that the manner of death was an accident. More than 11 years after submitting those findings, Young does not mince words: Farley’s conclusion that Mariah’s death was caused by abuse was pure guesswork. “Everything that Dr. Farley is doing here is nonsensical.”</p>
<p>According to court records, Farley looked at Mariah’s body, decided that she’d been abused, and then conducted an examination confirming her assumption. But there was no history of Mariah being physically abused by her mother, including in the extensive records compiled by the state child welfare agency. “That is critical,” Young said. “Nobody saw child abuse.” Moreover, other members of the family saw Mariah at the bottom of the stairs, told authorities that she’d fallen, and watched her condition deteriorate over the next two days. “They were … there to see this happen to the child,” he said.</p>
<p>The better approach would have been to conduct the autopsy and then consider whether the family’s account of what happened was consistent with the medical evidence, Young said. “Is there a scientific explanation for that?”</p>
<p>In Mariah’s case, he said, there is a condition that could readily explain the toddler’s demise and much of the trauma identified by Farley at the autopsy: a swelling of the brain known as malignant cerebral edema, which has been documented in medical literature for decades. “It’s not entirely clear why this happens, but it does happen to children who have head trauma, even a relatively minor type of head trauma,” he said. “They can develop this reactive brain swelling.”</p>
<p>Left untreated, the condition can have devastating, cascading effects that, contrary to Farley’s testimony, can develop over several days. The brain trauma and subsequent swelling lead to poor blood circulation. “There isn’t sufficient oxygenated blood getting to the brain,” which in turn causes tissue damage, Young said. What follows is a serious blood-clotting disorder known as disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, which can cause bruising anywhere — including on the internal organs. “As a result, any kind of minor handling of the child, the child will develop bruises,” he said.</p>
<p>Beyond the autopsy, there were problems with the way Lucio was questioned by police, which included a host of techniques seen in false confessions, said Fabiana Alceste, an assistant professor of psychology at Butler University who studies interrogations.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[12](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22left%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-left" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="left"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[12] -->Lucio’s behavior “was completely consistent with what we know about victims of trauma.&#8221;<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[12] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[12] -->
<p>The interrogation went on for hours. Meanwhile, Lucio was sleep-deprived, she hadn’t eaten all day, and she was pregnant with twins. She also had a history of being abused and was dealing with the death of her daughter — situational and dispositional factors that would leave her vulnerable to police manipulation. “That’s all happening already as she stepped into the interrogation room,” Alceste said. “She’s not coming into this a blank slate. She’s already in the midst of trauma.”</p>
<p>Indeed, while the cops homed in on Lucio’s demeanor as indicative of her guilt, the physical cues they pointed to as evidence have been <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/08/12/blueleaks-law-enforcement-police-lie-detection/">debunked by science</a>. Contrary to the narrative presented by the state at trial, Lucio’s behavior “was completely consistent with what we know about victims of trauma, the kind of numbing and dissociation … that is present in virtually every case of every woman sentenced to death, because like Melissa, many of them are victims of severe, repeated trauma,” said Babcock, the Cornell law professor who specializes in capital defense.</p>
<p>Then there are the tactics the police used in their interrogation. The investigators employed a so-called maximization strategy “aimed to increase the suspect’s anxiety, and especially their anxiety related to denying involvement or guilt,” Alceste said — for example, telling Lucio that they knew Mariah had been abused. “They repeatedly block her objections and her denials and tell her that it’s not possible that there are other explanations.”</p>
<p>On the flip side, the interrogators also deployed &#8220;minimization&#8221; techniques, communicating “that there may be some moral excuse for having committed this crime” and that if the suspect “acquiesces and confesses to what the interrogators are saying, that they’re going to somehow be treated with more leniency,” she said. “It’s all over Melissa’s interrogation,” including in the suggestion that Lucio hurt Mariah because she was frustrated by having to take care of so many kids. In fact, Alceste noted, it was the interrogators who first suggested the idea of frustration, which Lucio later parroted back to them.</p>
<p>Combining these techniques compounds the risk of a false confession. In Lucio’s case, the interrogators pushed her into a corner with no real option but to confess — to something. “That’s the only control that you have in the situation, and it’s not a true choice,” Alceste said. “They’re telling you if you confess to this being an accident or frustration or something that the jury is going to find sympathetic or understandable, that’s better for you. And if you don’t, then you’re a cold-blooded murderer, and that’s going to be worse for you. … That is literally what coercion is.”</p>
<p>There is at least one additional problem with the case against Lucio: The interrogation and Lucio’s admission that she had abused Mariah occurred before Farley conducted her autopsy. And then Farley performed that autopsy with one of Lucio’s interrogators, Cruz, in the room. “The confession coming before the forensic analysis is extremely problematic,” Alceste said. “Confessions tend to color how forensic analysts view the information that they’re supposed to be analyzing objectively.”</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1556-4029.14697">study</a> demonstrated that death investigators’ judgments about a child’s manner of death — say, homicide versus accident — can be biased when they’re exposed to nonmedical information like the relationship of a caregiver to the child. Stereotypes about race, gender, and age can unduly influence manner-of-death decisions, the research revealed.</p>
<p>“The average person doesn’t realize that manner-of-death opinions are nonscientific in the sense that they aren’t decisive,” said <a href="https://www.towson.edu/cla/departments/psychology/facultystaff/jkukucka.html">Jeff Kukucka</a>, one of the study’s co-authors and an expert in confirmation bias in forensics. “There’s a lot of subjectivity involved; the same injury can often be interpreted in different ways, which creates room for bias.” For example, “if the child of an affluent white mother had the exact same injuries,” he said, “those injuries may very well be interpreted as an accident rather than abuse.”</p>

<h2>Lost Time</h2>
<p>John Lucio was in the car with his wife in January when he got a text message from a relative; it included a screenshot of a media report saying that an execution date had been set for Melissa. That’s how he found out that Texas intended to kill his mother on April 27.</p>
<p>John had only just started visiting his mom on death row after years of his own incarceration. The conditions of his release prevented him from going to see her right away. But after she got an execution date, he began making the eight-hour trip every weekend from Harlingen to the Gatesville Correctional Facility, home to women’s death row.</p>
<p>On January 22, John joined a Zoom meeting from the passenger’s seat of his car. With his wife driving, he held up his phone as the prison complex receded in the distance. He looked drained. It was his first visit with his mother since she’d been given a date. “This one really broke all three of us,” he said. Authorities told him that the closer her date got, the more time they would get together, which was cold comfort. “She’s scared,” he said. “She just wants to be home with us, with her family.”</p>
<p>The call was organized by <a href="https://deathpenaltyaction.org" target="_blank">Death Penalty Action</a>. Attendees included veteran abolitionists and family members of other people on death row. The group provided important moral support for John, who was being inundated by messages from his large extended family. “Everybody’s in pain about this situation,” he said. They wanted to help but didn’t know how. “They love my mother. They know who she is.”</p>

<p>In early February, the anti-death penalty organizers joined Lucio’s family in Harlingen for a flurry of in-person events. A family friend organized a booth at a farmers market downtown; locals signed petitions and bought T-shirts that read “Free Melissa Lucio.” Activists gathered at the Cameron County Courthouse for a rally and delivered petitions to District Attorney Luis Saenz, the former judge who set Lucio’s $2 million bond in 2007. He had requested the execution date.</p>
<p>On February 8, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott traveled to Harlingen for a private campaign event at a local barbecue joint. Lucio’s loved ones gathered in the parking lot. Inside the event, a family member managed to hand the governor a letter. “Our request to Gov. Abbott, everyone in Cameron County, and in the state of Texas is simple,” John said. “Watch the film, and then ask yourself if there is any doubt in your mind about my mom’s guilt.”</p>
<p>Most recently, the activists took their campaign outside the Rio Grande Valley, organizing film screenings in 10 cities across the state. Sabrina Van Tassel, who directed “The State of Texas vs. Melissa,” traveled from France for the tour, which culminated in a rally at the Texas Capitol in Austin. Lucio’s mother, Esperanza, was there along with John and other family members.</p>
<p>Standing behind a massive banner with her sister’s face on it, Sonya Valencia Alvarez took the mic. For years she had been one of Lucio’s most stalwart supporters, the sole family member to take the stand at her trial. In 2017, she showed Van Tassel the staircase in Harlingen where Mariah had fallen. Now she was having anguished conversations with Lucio about how to handle the logistics around her possible execution.</p>
<p>“My sister’s not the murderer that Cameron County said she is,” Alvarez said, speaking softly at first. “My sister is a loving mom.” Yes, she’d been poor and yes, she’d used drugs. “But Melissa loved her children tremendously.”</p>
<p>Her voice got louder, then broke. “We are tired, we are exhausted. We’re hurting, we’re broken,” she said. “Y’all stole 15 years, Mr. Villalobos,” she continued, her voice rising further. “You tore our family apart.”</p>
<p>There was still time to stop the execution. “Mr. Saenz, do the right thing. Do the right thing.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>The morning of</u> the oral argument in Shinn v. Ramirez, the last case on the U.S. Supreme Court’s calendar in 2021, Barry Jones’s children gathered around a large flat-screen TV in Tucson, Arizona. Jones’s daughter Brandie was there, as well as her younger brother James. Their youngest sibling, Andrew, whom Brandie often relied upon to explain the confusing litigation in their dad’s case, was working a remodeling job in Nevada. He’d try to listen to the argument on his phone.</p>
<p>Now in their 30s, the siblings were just kids when their dad was sentenced to die. He’d been accused of an unfathomable crime: the rape and murder of his girlfriend’s 4-year-old daughter, Rachel. Jones swore he was innocent — and the case against him was flimsy from the start. In 2017, an evidentiary hearing finally dismantled the evidence that sent Jones to death row. The next year, a federal judge <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2018/08/01/barry-jones-arizona-death-row-conviction-overturned/" target="_blank">overturned</a> his conviction, ordering the state to retry Jones or release him. But that never happened. Instead, Arizona appealed the decision all the way to Washington, D.C.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>The siblings gathered at the home of their aunt Deborah Wheeler for the oral argument in early December. “I’ve always believed he was innocent,” Wheeler said. Although Jones had problems with drugs when he was younger, that didn’t make him a murderer, she said. “And I know he would never hurt a little kid.” Wheeler recalled a time when Jones stayed with her while working part time at a copper mine east of Phoenix. She was struck by Jones’s kindness to her daughters, as well as her disabled son. “Barry was always so good to him,” she said.</p>
<p>Wheeler was living in Phoenix when Jones was arrested in Tucson on May 2, 1994. Rachel’s lifeless body had been found earlier that morning in the trailer Jones shared with the child’s mother, Angela Gray. As they would later discover, Rachel had died following a rupture in her small intestine, which developed into a fatal condition called peritonitis. Although Jones was distraught after taking Rachel and Gray to the hospital, he soon became the sole suspect.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[1] -->
<p>Wheeler was disturbed by the little she saw of Jones’s 1995 trial. “I remember thinking then, he had no defense, everything was just accusations,” she said. Jones’s court-appointed lawyers called no witnesses at the guilt phase apart from Brandie, who was 12 years old. When Wheeler was called to testify at the sentencing, “nobody prepared me,” she said.</p>
<p>Had Jones’s lawyers been up to the task, there was plenty they could have done to defend their client. They could have pointed out that the lead detective, who examined Rachel at the hospital, didn’t bother to investigate how or when the child sustained her fatal injury — or consider a single other suspect aside from Jones. They could have called a medical expert to show that there was no real evidence that the child had been raped. Most crucially, Jones’s lawyers could have called a pathologist to challenge the state’s theory of the crime, which rested on a narrow timeframe during which Jones had supposedly assaulted Rachel the day before her death. Medical experts now say that Rachel’s abdominal injury could not have become fatal so quickly. One doctor said she was unaware of any reported cases in which such an injury could have resulted in death in under 48 hours.</p>
<p>It was not until the evidentiary hearing 22 years after the trial that Jones’s federal public defenders presented this evidence, not to a jury but to U.S. District Judge Timothy Burgess. After seven days of testimony at Tucson’s federal courthouse, Burgess concluded that Jones’s trial had been marred by ineffective assistance of counsel — a violation of his Sixth Amendment rights. But for the failures of Jones’s trial attorneys, Burgess <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4636294-Barry-Jones-Order-07-31-18.html" target="_blank">wrote</a>, “there is a reasonable probability that his jury would not have convicted him of <em>any</em> of the crimes with which he was charged and previously convicted.”</p>
<p>But the Arizona attorney general challenged Burgess’s ruling, appealing <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/08/13/arizona-death-penalty/" target="_blank">first</a> to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which sided with Jones, and then to the U.S. Supreme Court. In their <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1009/166813/20210120132000573_Ramirez%25252520Jones%25252520Petition.pdf">petition</a> for certiorari, the brief asking the court to hear the case, Arizona prosecutors argued that Burgess and the 9th Circuit had violated the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. The law, known as AEDPA, limits the avenues for challenging a criminal conviction. According to Arizona, Burgess should never have been allowed to use the evidence presented at the hearing to overturn Jones’s conviction. In May, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/qp/20-01009qp.pdf">announced</a> that it would hear the case.</p>
<p>Jones’s attorneys had sent Wheeler a link to the oral argument. Over bacon and eggs, the family gathered to listen at 10 a.m. Tucson time. There was no video, only an image of the Supreme Court building, so it was hard to tell which of the justices was speaking — let alone what they were talking about. Jones’s family quickly got lost in the sea of legalese. “I kept asking, ‘Are they still talking about Dad?’” Brandie said. But one thing jumped out. The attorney for the state repeatedly told the justices, “Innocence isn’t enough.”</p>

<h2>A Bellwether Case</h2>
<p>Although the question before the court is highly technical, the decision in Jones’s case will have far-reaching implications for people in prison and on death row. For those who are innocent, the stakes are uniquely high: The justices are effectively deciding whether new evidence — like that presented at Jones’s 2017 evidentiary hearing — should be ignored by the federal courts, even when it exposes a wrongful conviction.</p>
<p>In an amicus brief <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1009/193051/20210920164224063_Shinn%20v.%20Ramirez%20-%20Innocence%20Network%20Amicus.pdf" target="_blank">filed</a> in September, the Innocence Network, a consortium of organizations that works to correct wrongful convictions, argued that exonerations won through Sixth Amendment challenges often hinge on evidence uncovered long after a defendant’s trial. “Without such evidence, basic failures to investigate cannot be corrected, faulty forensic evidence cannot be unmasked, and the innocent individuals who are the victims of these deficiencies have no route to justice,” the brief read.</p>
<p>News of the Supreme Court’s decision to take up Jones’s case arrived on the same day the high court announced that it would hear the Mississippi abortion <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/12/02/abortion-supreme-court-mississippi/" target="_blank">case</a> threatening Roe v. Wade. Although Jones’s case flew mostly under the radar, many legal experts saw the move as another emblem of the court’s extreme rightward shift since Justices Anthony Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsberg were replaced by Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. “I think that if Justice Ginsberg and Justice Kennedy were still on the court, it’s not likely they would have granted cert to begin with,” said Jones’s longtime attorney, Arizona Assistant Federal Defender Cary Sandman.</p>

<p>For law professor Leah Litman, an expert in federal post-conviction review and co-host of the <a href="https://strictscrutinypodcast.com" target="_blank">podcast</a> “Strict Scrutiny,” the court’s decision will also be “a bellwether case for how extreme this court will be” on other issues. In a call with reporters in early December, Litman pointed out an amicus <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1009/184634/20210722125114461_Shinn%20v.%20Ramirez%20Amicus%20Brief%20FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">brief</a> in favor of Arizona brought by the former Texas solicitor general who authored the draconian abortion <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/11/02/abortion-texas-sb8-supreme-court/" target="_blank">law</a> known as S.B. 8. “I think it’s important to understand the antics in this case as the antics that are happening elsewhere on the court’s docket this term,” she said.</p>
<p>Among the small percentage of cases the court agrees to review every year, the justices have traditionally taken those that serve as vehicles for resolving conflicts between the lower courts. In Jones’s case, which was consolidated with that of another man on death row named David Ramirez under the title Shinn v. Ramirez, Arizona argued that the 9th Circuit had misconstrued a previous Supreme Court ruling, Martinez v. Ryan, in violation of AEDPA. Yet there was no dispute in the lower courts on the matter; no federal court has adopted Arizona’s argument. As Jones’s attorneys <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1009/173295/20210329184333568_2021.03.29%20Shinn%20Brief%20in%20Opposition.pdf" target="_blank">told</a> the justices, the state sought “to manufacture a problem where none exists.”</p>
<p>Many legal experts saw Arizona’s real goal as overturning the court’s 2012 decision in Martinez. The 7-2 ruling provided a lifeline to people in prison and on death row, who often face insurmountable barriers to getting their cases heard in federal court despite being entitled to federal review. Specifically, the decision sought to fix a long-standing problem for those who had shoddy representation at trial. Under Arizona law, defendants only had one chance following their conviction to argue in state court that their right to counsel had been violated. Although indigent defendants were given lawyers to handle this critical stage of their appeal, many were similarly unqualified or ill-prepared to represent their clients. This had grave consequences: If a state post-conviction attorney failed to challenge a trial lawyer’s performance, their client would be forever barred from bringing the claim forward in federal court, a concept known as procedural default.</p>
<p>But Martinez created a path to relief. If a defendant had not brought a substantive ineffective assistance claim because their post-conviction lawyer, too, was ineffective, the justices decided, this default could be excused, allowing a federal court to consider the claim. Writing for the majority, Kennedy explained the importance of the ruling. For a person facing a lifetime in prison — or worse, execution — an ineffective post-conviction lawyer likely meant that “no state court at any level will hear the prisoner’s claim.” Without the remedy created by Martinez, there would be no way to uphold defendants’ Sixth Amendment right to counsel — “a bedrock principle in our justice system.”</p>
<h2>Tough Luck</h2>
<p>For Jones and Ramirez, who had been on death row for a combined 40 years when Martinez was decided, the ruling opened a door that had long been closed. Both men had been shut out of federal court after their state post-conviction lawyers failed to challenge their trial lawyers’ most egregious mistakes. Jones’s post-conviction lawyer had repeated the errors of his trial attorneys, failing to investigate the medical basis for the state’s case, which would have debunked the whole theory of the crime. After Burgess overturned Jones’s conviction, a unanimous panel of the 9th Circuit rejected Arizona’s appeal, upholding the order to release or retry him.</p>
<p>Ramirez’s case followed a different trajectory. Convicted of murdering his girlfriend and her teenage daughter in 1989, he did not claim his innocence. But he did have significant mental impairments and a long history of childhood trauma, abuse, and neglect. Ramirez’s lead trial attorney, who had never handled a death penalty case, did not investigate this evidence. His post-conviction lawyer largely failed to do the same. Although a federal district court initially rejected Ramirez’s argument that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing in light of Martinez, a unanimous 9th Circuit panel reversed the decision, directing the court to allow the hearing.</p>

<p>The 9th Circuit rulings came months apart. The Arizona attorney general’s office blamed a common denominator for its defeats: not the years of incompetent lawyering now haunting the state’s capital convictions, but the fact that the Supreme Court’s Martinez ruling was allowing defendants to prove their ineffective assistance claims in federal court. In the state’s view, neither Jones nor Ramirez should have ever made it so far. Prosecutors specifically pointed to a provision of AEDPA that forbade federal courts from holding evidentiary hearings on claims that had not been developed in state court. Just because Martinez allowed defendants to bring a claim that had been previously barred did not mean they were entitled to prove it.</p>
<p>Practically, the argument made no sense. Why would the Supreme Court dangle the chance to get back into federal court if defendants were doomed from the start? In Jones’s case, the 9th Circuit panel had seemed <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/08/13/arizona-death-penalty/" target="_blank">baffled</a> by the rationale offered by Assistant Attorney General Myles Braccio at oral argument. He insisted that while Martinez may have allowed for the evidence uncovered by Jones’s federal public defenders to get Jones’s claim of ineffective assistance before a judge, Burgess was required by AEDPA to ignore that same evidence when deciding whether Jones’s trial lawyers had been ineffective. Instead, he should have relied on the state record. “But that doesn’t make sense if the claim wasn’t developed in state court,” one judge told Braccio. “You’d be looking at a vacuum.” Another judge called it “a Catch-22.”</p>

<p>Although the 9th Circuit rejected Arizona’s position — and denied its appeal for a rehearing — the state’s argument gained currency elsewhere on the bench. Judge Daniel Collins, a Trump appointee, dissented from the court’s refusal to rehear the case, accusing his colleagues of using Martinez to create a judge-made exception to AEDPA in the cases of both Jones and Ramirez. Legislators had crafted such procedural rules to ensure finality, he said. If the result seemed harsh, tough luck. “To the extent that it seems unfair that a potentially meritorious claim might escape federal habeas review, that feature is inherent in the restrictions that AEDPA imposes.”</p>
<p>It’s true that AEDPA set a deliberately high bar for federal review, which has proven disastrous for countless defendants since its passage. But it’s not true that the law was explicitly designed to be quite as harsh as Collins or the Arizona attorney general insisted. When President Bill Clinton <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2016/05/04/the-untold-story-of-bill-clintons-other-crime-bill/" target="_blank">signed</a> AEDPA in 1996, he emphasized that the provision barring evidentiary hearings should not be read “to deny litigants a meaningful opportunity to prove the facts necessary to vindicate federal rights.”</p>
<p>In an amicus <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1009/192970/20210920141053495_20-1009%20Amicus%20Brief%20of%20Habeas%20Scholars.pdf" target="_blank">brief</a> filed on behalf of Jones and Ramirez, legal scholars traced the language of this provision to show that legislators had aimed to limit hearings only when defendants were at fault for failing to develop evidence in state court. In Martinez, the Supreme Court provided a chance at relief for defendants like Jones and Ramirez on the grounds that they were not responsible for the failures of their post-conviction lawyers.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Collins’s dissent formed much of the basis of Arizona’s petition to the Supreme Court in Shinn v. Ramirez. The Texas attorney general, joined by a dozen death penalty states, filed a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1009/170181/20210226134023599_20-1009%20Amici%20Brief.pdf" target="_blank">brief</a> urging the court to take the case, “to reassert [AEDPA’s] primacy over the judge-made rule of Martinez.” After the justices granted review, a number of additional briefs were submitted on behalf of Ramirez and Jones.</p>
<p>One, brought by a group of former Department of Justice prosecutors, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1009/193115/20210920203807545_20-1009%20bsac%20Former%20DOJ%20Officials%20and%20Prosecutors.pdf" target="_blank">warned</a> that Arizona was trying to “transform Martinez into a hollow precedent” offering “an empty promise of judicial review.” Another, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1009/192985/20210920144714282_20-1009%20bsac.pdf" target="_blank">filed</a> on behalf of former federal judges and state supreme court judges, called Arizona’s argument “absurd,” warning that a ruling in the state’s favor would make federal judges “complicit in the greatest miscarriage of justice of all — the imprisonment and execution of innocent people.”</p>

<h2>The Problem of Innocence</h2>
<p>Shinn v. Ramirez was argued on December 8 before a mostly empty court. The justices had already heard two hours of oral arguments that morning in a case involving religion and education, which provided a stark reminder of the court’s lurch toward the right; at one point, Justice Sam Alito invoked critical race theory.</p>
<p>Just before noon, Arizona Assistant Attorney General Brunn Wall Roysden III took his place. While the justices had spent most of the past year and a half working remotely before implementing strict Covid protocols to reconvene in person, Roysden, who goes by Beau, had spent his time challenging local mask and vaccine mandates on behalf of his boss, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich.</p>
<p>AEDPA set a deliberately high bar for evidentiary hearings, Roysden told the court. “Congress thus spoke clearly, and the courts’ role is to apply the statutory language,” he said. “That no fact-finder could have found the prisoner guilty is not enough.”</p>
<p>Justice Clarence Thomas asked the first question. Although he’d been one of two dissenters when the court decided Martinez almost a decade earlier, he declared it “odd” to allow a defendant to bring a previously barred claim of ineffective assistance of counsel only to forbid them from presenting the evidence to support it. “It seems pretty worthless” to excuse the procedural default in the first place, he said. “To what end?”</p>
<p>Echoing Braccio’s argument at the 9th Circuit, Roysden said that a judge could simply rely on the state court record. Since AEDPA forbade Burgess from considering new evidence to decide Jones’s case, he should never have held an evidentiary hearing without ensuring that the state record was enough to decide the case. “It’s a fruitless exercise,” Roysden said.</p>
<p>“But it’s a basic syllogism,” Chief Justice John Roberts interjected. “The idea is, if you do get the right to raise the claim for the first time, because your counsel was incompetent before, surely you have the right to get the evidence that’s necessary to support your claim.”</p>
<p>Kavanaugh chimed in. If what Roysden was saying was true, then “what’s the point of Martinez?” he asked. “The court obviously carefully crafted an opinion to give you the right to raise an ineffective assistance claim, to make sure it’s considered at least once, and this would really gut that in a lot of cases.”</p>
<p>If AEDPA and Martinez could not be reconciled, “then at the end of the day, Martinez should be overruled,” Roysden replied, finally stating outright what Arizona’s critics had identified as the real goal all along.</p>
<p>Kavanaugh showed some resistance to the idea of overturning Martinez. “I mean, you have to assume that the court majority was unaware somehow of how this would play out,” he said. It’s not like the justices were unaware of AEDPA’s provisions when it ruled. “It’s hard to envision the court thinking that that would make any sense.”</p>
<p>Roysden again emphasized Congress’s intent when it passed AEDPA. “Innocence isn’t enough here,” he said.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[7](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22left%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-left" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="left"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[7] -->“Whether you’re innocent or guilty, you have a right to a fair hearing. You have a right to an effective trial counsel.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[7] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[7] -->
<p>Justice Elena Kagan pointed out that AEDPA’s provision prohibiting evidentiary hearings was based on the assumption that a defendant was at fault for failing to develop the evidence in state court. “But that’s not always the rule,” Kagan said. In fact, the whole basis of Martinez was that the defendants in question were not at fault, she said, citing multiple passages from the decision.</p>
<p>“I think Martinez is not the last word,” Roysden replied.</p>
<p>The justices seemed skeptical of Arizona’s argument. But this was far from a guarantee. When attorney Robert Loeb stood to argue on behalf of Jones and Ramirez, reiterating that, under Martinez, they were not at fault for the failures of their post-conviction lawyers, Thomas once again declared the argument “odd.” Didn’t this “basically eviscerate the restrictions of AEDPA?” he asked. Justice Samuel Alito echoed the concern while tacitly acknowledging that there was no disagreement on the matter among the lower courts. “I certainly understand why the courts of appeals have interpreted Martinez the way they did,” he said. “But the fact remains that we have to follow the federal habeas statute. We have to follow AEDPA, unless it’s unconstitutional.”</p>
<p>Although he had joined the majority in Martinez, Alito now seemed to suggest that AEDPA had been in tension with their decision all along but no one had noticed: “The fact of the matter is that this whole … issue was not briefed by anybody in Martinez, and the court didn’t address it.” Roberts, who was also in the majority in Martinez, asked Loeb if he could point to “a case that says how we’re supposed to reconcile those two things.” Loeb responded that the two were not actually in conflict.</p>
<p>Kavanaugh returned to the problem of innocence. Although Loeb decried the state’s argument that a federal court should “turn a blind eye” to evidence showing Jones was wrongly convicted, Arizona countered that state law offered defendants an alternate means to prove their innocence. “I have no idea whether this is sufficient, but I just want you to respond to it,” Kavanaugh said. Loeb pointed out that no one had ever successfully availed themselves of this statute. But more importantly, “whether you’re innocent or guilty, you have a right to a fair hearing. You have a right to an effective trial counsel.” Telling a defendant to rely on such a law after a trial in which their constitutional rights had been violated was like a basketball game in which one team gets five players and the other gets one — but the latter gets to shoot the ball from half court. “That does not make the game fair, Your Honor.”</p>
<h2>A Sense of Urgency</h2>
<p>A ruling in Shinn is expected in the spring. If Jones prevails, it will place him in the same position he would have been in back in 2018 had Arizona prosecutors heeded Burgess’s order to release or retry him. With the state’s evidence against Jones thoroughly discredited, the Pima County Attorney’s Office is unlikely to seek a new trial.</p>
<p>Although the Tucson office has gained a reputation for being progressive in recent years, it has thus far declined to use its available recourses to exonerate Jones. The office’s newly revamped <a href="https://www.pcao.pima.gov/pcao-divisions/conviction-integrity-unit/" target="_blank">Conviction and Sentencing Integrity Unit</a>, which reinvestigates possible innocence cases, refused to examine Jones’s conviction as it made its way through the federal courts. Asked whether the office might consider the case in the coming year, the new head of the unit, Jack Chin, wrote that “while I am aware of this case, I have not spent a great deal of time on it because it is not before this office now.”</p>

Sowards, who retired this year, has been convinced of Jones’s innocence since he first uncovered evidence that had been withheld by the state at trial. Although he thought the oral argument had gone as well as it could have for Jones, his frustration over Jones’s predicament was palpable. “We’ve asked so much of him,” he said. “I mean, that office has had him for 21 years now. You know, there’s only so many times you can ask for someone’s patience.”</p>
<p>In the years since Burgess overturned Jones’s conviction, the prosecutors who represented the state in trying to keep him on death row have moved on with their careers. One is now a judge in Pinal County, home to Arizona’s death row. Another is employed at the Pima County Attorney’s Office. In the fall, Burgess announced that he would retire at the end of this year.</p>
<p>Among those who once celebrated Jones’s vacated conviction, not all have lived long enough to see whether he will ever go free. On the night before the oral argument in Shinn, I discovered that one of Jones’s trial jurors, who I’d interviewed in 2017, died last year. Hildegard Stoecker was haunted by Jones’s conviction — and disturbed that Arizona would continue to fight his appeal. In an email in 2018, she reiterated that she never would have voted to convict Jones if she’d been aware of the evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing. She expressed hope that he would find the strength to move forward once his case was resolved.</p>
<p>“Barry Jones will have to find a way to reclaim his life after decades on death row,” she wrote. “I will have to find a way to deal with the fact that I was part of the system that made that happen.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Across from the</u> Augusta State Medical Prison on Highway 10, the red Cadillac Escalade pulled up just before 4 p.m. Beaming in the passenger’s seat with his granddaughter on his lap, 43-year-old Devonia Inman waved to the people gathered at the side of the road, who cried and cheered as the car came to a stop. “Thank you, Jesus!” a man said as Inman got out and embraced one of his cousins. Inman’s father, David Ray, got out of the backseat and picked up his great-granddaughter as his son received hugs from the crowd. Ray wore a pinstriped suit and a face mask that read “Devonia.”</p>
<p>Inman had walked out of the prison moments earlier, on December 20. Only his parents and legal team had been allowed to meet him. Prison staff had ordered the rest of Inman’s relatives to leave, directing them across the road. The family had driven three hours to Augusta from Adel, in South Georgia, the last place Inman had ever known life as a free man before being arrested in 1998 for a murder he swore he did not commit.</p>
<p>Cars and trucks sped by as the group watched for signs of Inman. Andrekos Pickett, one of several cousins who had come from Adel, said the family had always hoped Inman would be cleared. “We knew this day was coming,” he said. “We just didn&#8217;t know it was gonna take this long.” Another cousin, Tamara Pickett, was emotional as she held up her phone to share the moment on Facebook Live. She had been so excited about Inman’s release that she had barely slept the night before. “I was a little girl, like 11, whenever this happened,” she said of the crime. Inman had been one of her favorite cousins; she said she followed him everywhere. “I used to write him all these letters,” she said. But after being transferred from prison to prison, he’d lost track of them. “He said, I’ve been so many places now I don’t know where they are.”</p>

<p>The days and hours leading up to that moment had been fraught with uncertainty. After a Georgia judge <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/11/20/devonia-inman-conviction-overturned/">overturned his conviction</a> on November 16, the Georgia Attorney General’s Office stayed silent on whether it would appeal until hours before the deadline on December 16. Although the Cook County District Attorney’s Office swiftly announced that it would not seek a retrial, the timing and location of Inman&#8217;s release remained unclear even to his lawyers until hours before it happened, contingent on legal filings, paperwork, and the often arbitrary whims of the Georgia Department of Corrections.</p>
<p>Inman’s exoneration was the culmination of decades of work, first by the Georgia Innocence Project, which secured DNA evidence pointing to another suspect, and then by Jessica Cino, a former law professor at Georgia State University, who brought his case to the attention of the Atlanta law firm Troutman Pepper, which took it on pro bono. After spending almost his entire adult life behind bars, Inman now faces a long road to realizing a future that was derailed by his wrongful conviction. His release also leaves open the question of whether anyone will be held accountable for the murder that sent Inman to prison.</p>
<p>Standing in front of the Escalade as his supporters took photos, Inman looked both grateful and overwhelmed. His mother, Dinah, looked on with pride and relief. “My heart was racing,” she said of the wait to see her son. “But when I saw him, then I knew it was real.”</p>

<h2>“Let Justice Be Done”</h2>
<p>Inman’s case was the subject of “<a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/podcasts/murderville/">Murderville, Georgia</a>,” a podcast and written <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/series/murderville/">series</a> published by The Intercept in 2018. The investigation revealed how shoddy police work by local law enforcement and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation not only led to a wrongful conviction, but also left the real murderer free to kill again.</p>
<p>Inman was sentenced to life in prison for the September 19, 1998 murder of Donna Brown. Brown, a 43-year-old single mother, was the night manager of the Taco Bell in Adel, a small city not far from the Florida state line. She was shot in the face in the parking lot after work. The killer took a bank bag containing $1,700 that Brown was carrying, along with her car, which was abandoned at a shuttered Pizza Hut nearby. While neither the money nor the bag was ever found, a key piece of evidence was left in the passenger seat of Brown’s car: a homemade mask fashioned from a pair of gray sweatpants with eye holes cut out of it.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[2](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A2%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="2"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[2] -->
<p>Neither the mask nor any other physical evidence tied Inman to the crime. Multiple witnesses who initially implicated Inman recanted their statements even before Inman was tried in 2001. Nevertheless, he was convicted and sent to prison.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the murders in Adel continued, sending shockwaves through the city of about 5,000. In April 2000 — as Inman was in jail awaiting trial — a man named Shailesh Patel was beaten to death at home after closing shop at a nearby convenience store. His murder has <a href="https://gbi.georgia.gov/cases/unsolved-homicide/shailesh-s-patel">never been solved</a>. Later the same year, a beloved local shopkeeper, William Bennett, and his employee, Rebecca Browning, were bludgeoned to death in broad daylight inside Bennett’s store. A man named Hercules Brown (no relation to Donna Brown) was quickly arrested for the double murder and eventually pleaded guilty.</p>
<p>In fact, Hercules, who worked at the Taco Bell, had long been rumored to be Donna Brown’s real killer. Several people even said that Hercules had confessed to them; two said that Hercules confessed long before Inman was even tried.</p>
<p>A decade after Inman was convicted of Brown’s murder, DNA lifted from the mask left in her car was matched to Hercules. Yet the Georgia Attorney General’s Office fought tooth and nail to uphold Inman’s conviction. Neither Hercules’s proven violence nor the DNA evidence linking him to Donna Brown’s murder — a murder the state alleged was committed by a single perpetrator — was enough to impress the courts, which declined to intervene in Inman’s case.</p>

<p>Inman was finally able to get back into court after the pro bono team from Troutman Pepper found additional evidence pointing to Hercules, which the lawyers alleged had been illegally withheld from the defense at trial. In 2019, Lookout Mountain Chief Judge Kristina Cook Graham ordered a hearing on the new evidence and on a claim that Inman had received ineffective representation at trial. The AG’s office tried to block this from happening, telling the Georgia Supreme Court that Inman was procedurally barred from raising these claims at all.</p>
<p>But where the Supreme Court had previously refused to review Inman’s case after the DNA evidence first came to light, this time they rejected the state’s position, paving the way for the hearing — and, ultimately, Inman’s freedom. In an <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/09/20/murderville-georgia-devonia-inman-justice/">extraordinary concurring opinion</a>, the court’s then-presiding judge, David Nahmias, expressed deep regret over the court’s previous inaction.</p>
<p>“Of the multitude of cases in which a new trial has been denied, Inman’s case is the one that causes me the most concern that an innocent person remains convicted and sentenced to serve the rest of his life in prison,” wrote Nahmias, who is now the court’s chief judge. “Let justice be done.”</p>
<p>In the run-up to the hearing before Graham, Inman’s attorneys were given access to more than 15,000 pages of records belonging to his original trial lawyers. They were also given permission to interview Hercules Brown in prison. When the time came for that interview, however, Hercules refused to participate.</p>
<p>The hearing, which was repeatedly delayed by the pandemic, finally <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/08/02/murderville-podcast-the-case-for-a-new-trial/">happened in June</a>. It started off with a bang: Graham granted a motion by the defense requesting that an “adverse inference” be drawn from Hercules’s refusal to cooperate. In other words, she would officially consider Hercules’s silence as an indication that he was guilty of murdering Donna Brown. Although the Fifth Amendment protects against self-incrimination in a criminal proceeding, for the purpose of Inman’s appeal, which is considered a civil matter, such a conclusion was fair game.</p>

<p>The remainder of the hearing focused on the two ways that Inman’s rights had been violated. Troutman attorney Tom Reilly argued that the state had concealed evidence from the defense at Inman’s trial and that the lawyers who handled his trial, and the first appeal of his conviction, had failed to provide him adequate representation.</p>
<p>In November, Graham issued her ruling, <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/11/20/devonia-inman-conviction-overturned/">overturning Inman’s conviction</a>. “Under the circumstances of this extraordinary case and having carefully considered the evidence presented,” Graham <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21114593-devonia-inman-habeas-ruling">concluded</a> that the ways Inman’s trial and appeals played out “were fundamentally unfair and are unworthy of confidence in their outcome.”</p>
<p>Graham’s ruling left the attorney general&#8217;s office with a choice: drop its opposition or appeal the ruling back up to the Georgia Supreme Court. The office was given 30 days to make its decision. There was good reason to think it would appeal. The office spent years defending Inman’s conviction and arguing in court that he was legally barred from even attempting to challenge it.</p>
<p>But in reality, the AG had no meaningful choice: In its 2019 ruling, the Supreme Court made its position in the case clear and had implored the state to stand down and stop trying to block Inman’s access to justice. Still, with the holidays looming, the office dragged its feet, waiting until the last minute to notify Inman’s lawyers and the courts that it would not appeal.</p>
<p>That decision bounced the case back to Cook County, where Alapaha Judicial Circuit District Attorney Chase Studstill, would have to decide whether to drop the case or retry Inman. On December 20, Studstill asked for the case to be dismissed. In a late-morning order, the circuit’s Chief Judge Clayton Tomlinson agreed. “It is the State’s assessment that continuing to litigate this case is not in the interest of justice,” he wrote. Inman was released a few hours later.</p>

<h2>Justice Delayed</h2>
<p>The day after Inman walked out of prison, Studstill spoke to The Intercept over the phone. A former public defender who grew up in South Georgia, he said he was aware of the case well before he took office in May. He said he spent the next seven months getting up to speed on the case. “Each weekend, in any spare time I had, I spent looking at stuff from this case.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[6](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[6] -->
<p>Studstill pointed to a number of factors beyond the case itself that shaped his decision to facilitate Inman’s release. Foremost among them was Nahmias’s concurrence. “That is a very rare thing to see in the law is this judge almost saying, ‘Dang it, we had a chance to hear this and we decided not to. But now looking at it down the road, we probably should’ve heard this,’” he said. “I mean, that’s what we took from it.”</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Studstill said he had to decide if the evidence would warrant retrying Inman. Graham’s decision to grant the adverse inference against Hercules Brown caught his attention. “I knew when the adverse inference order was issued that I had an uphill battle if this office was going to retry,” he said. When Graham ruled that Inman’s rights had been violated at trial, he said that was “the final nail in the coffin.”</p>
<p>Studstill made clear that the media attention at the local and national level had also made an impact. He cited the “Murderville” podcast as raising the need to renew the efforts to solve the murder of Shailesh Patel, which the GBI has claimed to be investigating with no discernible results. “That’s a case I definitely want closure on,” he said. Although he would not comment on any specific actions he might be taking, he said that cold cases are a priority for him. “Those victims have yet to get their justice.”</p>
<p>Studstill said he was still weighing whether to charge Hercules with Donna Brown’s murder. “The one thing I will say is with Mr. Brown, I would have more of a charge to make a case on him if he weren’t sitting where he is today,” he said. “In other words, because he’s never getting out of prison, the necessity in trying to build a strong case against him isn’t as strong as if he were a free man.”</p>
<p>Asked whether he’d talked to Donna Brown’s family about Inman’s release or about the possibility of charging Hercules with her murder, Studstill said, “I don’t have a comment on that at this time.”</p>
<p>The Intercept tried to reach several members of Brown’s family but did not receive a response.</p>
<h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
<p>The road ahead for Inman is not an easy one. He’ll have to work to build a future for himself and face the challenge of renewing relationships damaged by his incarceration — including with his son, now a father himself, who was just a toddler when Inman was convicted. And he’ll have to navigate a world much different than the one he left when he was first locked up in 1998. He’ll have to find employment and his own place to live.</p>
<p>And he’ll have to do all of it without any help from the state of Georgia, which is one of 13 states that does not have a law providing compensation for the wrongly convicted. Instead, Georgia lawmakers have taken a <a href="https://www.law.com/dailyreportonline/2021/06/22/ga-needs-a-better-process-for-compensating-the-wrongfully-convicted/">piecemeal approach</a>, passing individual bills aimed at compensating individual exonerees. In other words, Inman would have to find a state lawmaker willing to file a bill proposing that he be compensated and then wait to see if that bill would ever become law.</p>
<p>Given the state’s lack of a meaningful compensation scheme, the Georgia Innocence Project this week started a <a href="https://www.mightycause.com/story/Supportdevoniainman">MightyCause fundraising campaign</a> for Inman, hoping that the public might pitch in where the state will not. Without a compensation package, “exonerees like Devonia can be left on their own,” the GIP notes. “With that in mind, this personal fundraiser is a way to help Devonia get back on his feet.”</p>
<p>After his release on Monday, Inman and his family drove back to Adel for a family celebration. Two days later, he would fly home to California with his parents to spend the holidays together for the first time in more than 23 years. Before they left Augusta, David Ray thanked everyone who played a role in his son’s release. “It’s like a dream come true. &#8230; My son’s coming home,” he said. “This is the best Christmas ever.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Almost 30 years</u> after Claude Garrett was accused of setting a fire that killed his girlfriend, Lorie Lance, the district attorney’s office in Nashville, Tennessee, has concluded that there is no evidence the fire was arson — and that Garrett was wrongfully convicted of Lance’s murder. In a notice of intent filed in Davidson County Criminal Court on Monday, District Attorney Glenn Funk told a judge that “clear and convincing evidence” indicates that Garrett is likely innocent, signaling the DA’s intention to request that Garrett’s conviction be vacated and the charges against him dismissed.</p>
<p>The DA’s notice was filed alongside a report by Sunny Eaton, director of the office’s Conviction Review Unit, who spent the past year closely reexamining Garrett’s case. “While the CRU’s review of this case did not uncover affirmative evidence conclusively establishing Garrett’s innocence,” Eaton wrote in the report, “the CRU finds it <em>wholly impossible</em> to maintain confidence in Garrett’s conviction. Holistic review of the record, the District Attorney’s file, and new scientific evidence dismantles every single piece of evidence previously believed to inculpate Garrett.”</p>

<p>Garrett was twice convicted of setting the fire that killed 24-year-old Lance in the small home they shared in Old Hickory, Tennessee, just outside Nashville. The couple had returned from a local bar in the early morning hours of February 24, 1992, when Garrett said he awoke to find a fire in the living room. According to Garrett, he woke up Lance and ran with her toward the front door, only for Lance to turn and run toward the rear of the house. Firefighters later found her in a utility room, dead from smoke inhalation.</p>
<p>Although neighbors initially described Garrett as frantic, yelling for Lance from outside, investigators became suspicious upon arriving at the scene, where they smelled kerosene and found a large irregular-shaped burn pattern on the living room floor. The lead investigator, James Cooper — a special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives — seized on this so-called pour pattern as proof that an ignitable liquid had been used to start the fire. He also concluded that the utility room had been locked from the outside, trapping Lance. Garrett was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.</p>
<p>Garrett’s case is one of countless arson convictions across the U.S. based on evidence that has since been debunked. Many visual indicators once believed to signal arson were rooted in a misunderstanding of fire behavior. The “pour pattern” found at the home in Old Hickory was in fact the result of a phenomenon called <a href="https://www.usfa.fema.gov/blog/cb-050520.html#:~:text=Flashover%20is%20a%20thermally%2Ddriven,%C2%B0F%20for%20ordinary%20combustibles.">flashover</a>, which was not widely understood in 1992. In the decades following Lance’s death, new developments in fire science transformed the techniques used to determine whether a fire is arson. But even as investigators have discarded the myths they once relied upon in favor of the scientific method, prosecutors have been slow to revisit old arson cases, frequently fighting to keep convictions intact.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->
<p>The Davidson County DA’s office is an important exception. “Interpreted in light of new scientific advances and guided by the professional analysis of ten experts who have reviewed the evidence in this case, there is no basis whatsoever to believe that an incendiary act by Garrett caused this fire any more than a hypothesis suggesting accidental cause,” Eaton wrote in the CRU report. If not for the office’s willingness to reexamine the work of its own former prosecutors, Garrett could easily have faced the prospect of dying in prison for a crime he did not commit.</p>
<p>Although a judge still has to accept the findings of the CRU — and hold a hearing before agreeing to vacate the conviction — Garrett, now 65, could soon be released. For fire investigator Stuart Bayne, who became Garrett’s most dedicated advocate after testifying at his second trial in 2003, the DA’s decision is both vindicating and long overdue. For 20 years, he has told anyone who would listen that Garrett is an innocent man. “Finally, other people are beginning to see it,” he said.</p>

<h3>A Sense of Urgency</h3>
<p>I first learned about Garrett’s case in the spring of 2013, from an advocate who visited him in prison. At a glance, the case contained striking parallels to the infamous story of Cameron Todd Willingham, who was wrongfully executed in Texas after being convicted of killing his own children in a fire. The two fatal fires took place within months of one another, just before the publication of “<a href="https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=921">NFPA 921</a>,” a manual that would eventually revolutionize the field of fire investigation.</p>
<p>Garrett’s conviction was also a case study in the legal system’s lack of recourse for people incarcerated based on faulty forensics — particularly in the absence of tangible exonerating evidence such as DNA. As with most old arson convictions, there was no evidence left to test, only photographs and reports by investigators whose examination of the scene had been perfunctory at best. Nevertheless, by the time I first met Garrett at the Riverbend Maximum Security Institution, his case had already been reviewed by two leading fire scientists, who made clear that the evidence used to convict him was junk science.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[3] -->
<p>One, the late Gerald Hurst, was best known for his attempts to clear Willingham before his 2004 execution. In a 2014 interview, Hurst told me that the fire investigation in Garrett’s case had been “a typical piece of crap” — based on a rush to judgment by an expert who believed that he could tell whether a fire was arson based on his observations alone. Renowned fire scientist John Lentini also reviewed the case as part of Garrett’s appellate proceedings and reached the same conclusion. Garrett tried to argue that his trial lawyers had been deficient for failing to effectively challenge the state’s arson evidence. But his appeal was denied.</p>
<p>After I published my <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2015/02/24/junkscienceclaudegarrett/">initial investigation in early 2015</a>, additional experts came forward to review the case, including fire engineer Craig Beyler, who produced a report on behalf of an international group of fire scientists that called itself the Tetrahedron Committee. Along with an updated report authored by Lentini, Garrett presented the Tetrahedron findings to his trial court in 2017, arguing that the experts’ conclusions were based on newly discovered evidence and established his innocence. But the Tennessee attorney general’s office objected, saying that the motion reflected no new evidence but merely “newly written opinions.”  The court dismissed Garrett’s motion without a hearing.</p>
<p>With the legal avenues for challenging his conviction increasingly narrowed, Garrett <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/02/24/claude-garrett-arson-case-parole-denied/" target="_blank">went</a> before the Tennessee Board of Parole in 2018, where he insisted on his innocence — a somewhat risky strategy given the imperative that applicants show remorse for their crimes. Despite a virtually spotless record behind bars and a vote in his favor by the board chair, Garrett’s bid was denied.</p>

<p>But that same year, a series of <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2018/10/05/claude-garrett-parole-arson-fire-junk-science/">follow-up stories by The Intercept</a> caught the attention of the Davidson County DA’s Office, which had recently launched the Conviction Review Unit. Although the CRU’s guidelines dictated that it would not consider applications “while any appeal, petition, or writ is pending in court” — which would have disqualified Garrett, who was pursuing a federal appeal — the unit also maintained the discretion “to review the case if it is in the interest of justice.” If there is compelling evidence of innocence, Assistant Attorney General Robert Jones told <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/02/24/claude-garrett-arson-case-parole-denied/">me in February 2019</a>, “we’re not gonna sit here for years and wait for the case to go through the courts.”</p>
<p>That same month, the <a href="https://www.tninnocence.org" target="_blank">Tennessee Innocence Project</a> launched in Nashville. Garrett would become one of its first clients. In August 2019, the organization’s executive director, Jessica Van Dyke, and federal public defender Michael Holley filed an application to the CRU on Garrett’s behalf. But it was not until Sunny Eaton took over in September 2020 that things started moving. A former defense attorney who had seen clients she believed to be innocent go to prison, Eaton <a href="https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/pithinthewind/a-nashville-defense-attorney-takes-over-the-da-s-conviction-review-unit/article_aff9cdc2-3c3a-5c40-8232-d88fe1b59539.html">told the Nashville Scene</a> that she intended to bring a “sense of urgency” to the work. “When I get a case to investigate, we either quickly need to restore confidence in that conviction,” she said, “or we need to remedy it.”</p>
<h3>Faulty, Outdated, and Unsubstantiated</h3>
<p>In the 14 months since Eaton took over, the CRU has accomplished more than it did during its first several years. Garrett’s case is the <a href="https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/pithinthewind/da-s-office-couple-convicted-of-1987-child-rape-and-murder-were-innocent/article_874f5f22-4254-11ec-a566-57bae309a65a.html" target="_blank">second</a> conviction the office has sought to overturn in November alone. Less than two weeks ago, the DA’s office asked a judge to vacate the tragic wrongful conviction of a Nashville couple, Joyce Watkins and Charlie Dunn, who were accused of raping and murdering a 4-year-old child in 1987. Watkins was granted parole in 2015, after 27 years in prison. Dunn died in prison that same year.</p>
<p>The convictions of Watkins and Dunn turned on the faulty forensic testimony of an expert who also played a key role in Garrett’s case: Dr. Gretel Harlan, the medical examiner who conducted the autopsy on Lance in 1992. Although Harlan did not find any evidence of injuries to support the theory that Garrett had forcibly locked Lance in the utility room before setting the fire, she did visit the fire scene alongside investigators, where she took photos of the latch on the door. The visit clearly shaped her analysis; at Garrett’s first trial, Harlan testified that burns found on various parts of Lance’s body could have been sustained inside the utility room at the back of the house, even though flames never reached the area. “Everyone is familiar with the process of sunburning,” Harlan said. “All the skin requires to sustain the burn is too long exposure in too high a heat.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[5](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[5] -->“Detectives relied so heavily on the fire investigation that they failed to perform basic investigative functions.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[5] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[5] -->
<p>Experts have repeatedly argued that this is ludicrous. But when I reached Harlan in 2014, she insisted that Lance “must have” gotten her burns inside the room since the door had been locked. The CRU report disagrees. It points to physical evidence that supports Garrett’s account that he and Lance ran past the living room toward the front door before Lance turned around. Garrett sustained burns on his face and left arm, which “were similar in location, depth, and intensity to those of Ms. Lance,” Eaton wrote. The CRU report echoes what Bayne has long argued: that the parallel burn patterns on Garrett and Lance show “that both bodies were in the same location, at the same point in time, facing the same intensity of heat exposure, from approximately the same distance to the heat source, for approximately the same duration.”</p>
<p>This exposure to intense heat would also help explain why Lance ran to the utility room. When I asked Hurst in 2014 why Lance would have run to the back of the house instead of following Claude out the front door, he explained that while she was almost certainly disoriented, people in a fire scenario will also do whatever they can to get away from smoke and flames. An enclosed room can provide protection from fire, he said, and for a time, it did. “If they had found her earlier, they might have saved her life,” he said.</p>
<p>Perhaps most important, the CRU report emphasizes that there was never any real evidence that the utility room was locked and Lance was trapped inside. Indeed, Garrett’s original 1993 conviction was overturned after he filed an open records request and received a police report that had been illegally withheld from his defense attorney. In the report, a Nashville police detective said he’d been told by the fire captain that the door had been found unlocked.</p>
<p>Eaton writes that “despite the enormous significance that was attached to the latch at trial,” investigators did not bother preserving or studying it. “Detectives relied so heavily on the fire investigation that they failed to perform basic investigative functions as they would have done in any other suspected homicide,” she wrote. Neither the door nor the latch was collected or analyzed even though, “according to the state’s theory, <em>these were the murder weapons in this case</em>.”</p>

<p>Experts have long pointed to the latch as critical. So has Garrett, who repeatedly constructed models of the latch while in prison. Because the locking mechanism relied on a latch that slid back and forth, its condition after the fire could have provided important clues. One photo from the scene, which Lentini included in his updated 2016 report, showed heavy smoke deposits on the edge of the door to the utility room — the part that would presumably have been shielded by the door frame had it been closed during the fire. These smoke deposits showed that the door “was not even closed” during the fire, let alone locked, Lentini wrote.</p>

<p>The CRU report reinforces this conclusion. Among other experts, it cites the work of a fire scientist named Candace Ashby, who in 2019 conducted an experiment that recreated the conditions of the fire. “Based on the carbonization differences,” the report states, Ashby concluded that “the latch was in the unlocked position during the fire.”</p>
<p>Many of the CRU report’s 50 pages focus on the work of Cooper, the ATF special agent. Experts consulted by the CRU found his “investigation to be faulty, his methods outdated, and his conclusions unsubstantiated,” Eaton wrote. In addition to lacking any scientific basis, the CRU notes, “his testimony in the second trial was emotionally charged, filled with inflammatory overstatements, mischaracterizations of the evidence, and assumptions regarding Garrett’s intent.”</p>
<p>Cooper is retired and living in Alabama. Although he has repeatedly refused to consider the many expert reports debunking his work, he has repudiated at least some of what he said at Garrett’s original trial. When I visited him in 2018, I asked him about his statement that burns on Garrett’s face had likely been sustained when he leaned down to light kerosene in the living room. Transcripts from the trial show that Cooper had compared it to lighting a gas grill: “Sometimes it won’t ignite and you stick your head down there to see and you’ve got this open flame that comes back with a POOF!” he said. Experts later deemed this to be impossible — and to my surprise, Cooper agreed. “I would be crazy to say that,” he said.</p>
<h3>Until the Door Opens</h3>
<p>The CRU report was filed less than a week after Garrett turned 65. In a phone call on his birthday, Garrett said his neighbors were giving him Pepsis and candy bars — “Things I don’t need,” he chuckled. In the years I have known Garrett, he has strived to take care of his health, which is not easy behind bars. Last year, as the coronavirus swept through Riverbend prison, he got sick with Covid, but his symptoms remained mild.</p>
<p>For a long time, Garrett was understandably skeptical of the CRU. Why would the same office that twice sent him to prison exonerate him? But he has also been heartened by the increased public scrutiny of the original prosecutor in his case, former Davidson County Assistant Attorney General John Zimmerman, who concealed the exculpatory police report and has since faced multiple accusations of prosecutorial misconduct. In 2019, a Nashville judge <a href="https://eji.org/news/tennessee-death-sentence-vacated-after-racial-discrimination/" target="_blank">vacated</a> the death sentence of Abu-Ali Abdur’Rahman on the grounds that Zimmerman had discriminated against Black jurors. Despite repeated attempts by the Tennessee attorney general to block a plea deal in the case, Abdur’Rahman was finally <a href="https://wpln.org/post/a-nashville-man-will-be-removed-from-death-row-after-years-of-legal-back-and-forth/" target="_blank">removed from death row</a> earlier this month.</p>
<p>In a phone call shortly after the CRU report was filed in court, Garrett expressed gratitude to those who have been willing to examine his case. “I’m thankful, I’m excited,” he said. But he’ll remain guarded “until the door opens.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[8](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[8] -->Garrett still faces a series of legal hurdles before he can be released.<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[8] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[8] -->
<p>Garrett’s caution is warranted: He still faces a series of legal hurdles before he can be released. The judge presiding over his case must be persuaded that the findings within the CRU report qualify as newly discovered evidence of innocence under Tennessee law, a claim the same court has previously rejected. Both the CRU report and a concurrent filing by Holley, Garrett&#8217;s federal public defender, and Van Dyke, of the Tennessee Innocence Project, argue extensively that the evidence provided by experts in Garrett’s case should count. Garrett’s attorneys cite five scientific developments since Garrett’s 2003 trial — including two studies from 2019, after Garrett&#8217;s last unsuccessful motion for relief — that were clearly unavailable to him at the time. &#8220;No court has reviewed these studies and developments. … Nor has any hearing been held where Mr. Garrett could present this new evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although he has yet to read the CRU report for himself, Garrett has been aware of its general conclusions for some time. News of the DA’s decision in his case first leaked on November 2, after the CRU discussed its findings with Lance’s surviving relatives. In a statement to Nashville’s Channel 5 News, Lance’s family wrote that they were saddened by the decision and “wholeheartedly believe” in Garrett’s guilt. The family has long insisted that Garrett was an abuser who killed Lance after finding out that she planned to leave him.</p>
<p>Although it deeply bothers Garrett that Lance&#8217;s family remains convinced he is a murderer, he speaks about them with compassion. “They’ve been victims just as much as I have,” he said.</p>
<p>On Monday afternoon, Channel 5 ran a second news segment, this time outlining the CRU’s findings. Garrett watched it on TV, as did other men in his unit. “It kind of makes it more real,” he said in a phone call Tuesday morning. Later, Garrett planned to call his daughter, who is waiting to introduce him to his 4-year-old grandson. “She’s excited. And frustrated that it is taking so long. But you know, she’s thankful as well,” Garrett said. “Probably a bit like me. Cautious.”</p>
<p>Garrett’s daughter, Deana, now in her 30s, has shared links to stories on Facebook about her dad’s case. Although she always believed in his innocence, she has only recently become outspoken about his wrongful conviction. After news of the CRU report first leaked, she was dismayed to see some negative reactions — a reminder that some people would never believe her father was innocent. But she resolved not to pay attention. “I’ve ignored it for this long,” she said. “I guess a little while longer couldn’t hurt.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>More than 20 years</u> after Devonia Inman was sentenced to life in prison for a murder he swears he did not commit, a judge in Georgia has overturned his conviction, writing that state misconduct and woefully inadequate defense lawyering rendered Inman’s 2001 conviction unconstitutional.</p>
<p>“Either of these constitutional violations, standing alone, demonstrates the fundamental unfairness of Mr. Inman’s trial, undermines the court’s confidence in the outcome of that trial and related conviction, and justifies granting … relief,” Lookout Mountain Chief Judge Kristina Cook Graham wrote in a 28-page order filed November 16.</p>
<p>The ruling sets up a choice for the state: Retry Inman for the 1998 murder of 43-year-old Donna Brown or release him. “We are hopeful that the court’s order will finally bring an end to this matter, and that Mr. Inman will be reunited with his family as soon as possible,” said Tom Reilly, one of Inman’s attorneys.</p>

<p>Inman’s case was the subject of “<a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/podcasts/murderville/">Murderville, Georgia</a>,” a podcast and four-part <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/series/murderville/">series</a> released by The Intercept in 2018. The investigation revealed how shoddy police work by local law enforcement and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation not only led to a wrongful conviction, but also left the real murderer free to kill again.</p>
<p>Brown was a single mother and the night manager at a Taco Bell in Adel, a small town in South Georgia. She was shot in the face on September 19, 1998, while leaving work. The killer took a bank bag containing $1,700 that Brown was carrying, along with her car, which was dumped in the nearby parking lot of an abandoned Pizza Hut. While the money was never found, a key piece of evidence was left in the car: a homemade mask made from a pair of gray sweatpants, with eyeholes cut out of it.</p>
<p>Neither the mask nor any other physical evidence tied Inman to the crime. Multiple witnesses who initially implicated Inman recanted their statements at his 2001 trial. Nevertheless, he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.</p>
<p>In the meantime, three more brutal murders rocked Adel, a town of roughly 5,000 people. In April 2000, as Inman awaited trial, a man named Shailesh Patel was beaten to death at home. That crime has never been solved. Later the same year, a beloved shopkeeper, William Bennett, and his employee, Rebecca Browning, were bludgeoned to death in broad daylight inside Bennett’s store. A man named Hercules Brown was quickly arrested for the double murder and eventually pleaded guilty.</p>
<p>Hercules, who worked at the Taco Bell, had long been rumored to be Donna Brown’s real killer. A decade after Inman was convicted of her murder, DNA lifted from the mask left in her car was matched to Hercules. Yet neither Hercules’s proven violence nor the DNA was enough to convince the courts that Inman’s case merited a second look. And the Georgia Attorney General’s Office has fought tooth and nail to uphold Inman’s conviction.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->
<p>Inman was able to get back into court after a pro bono defense team from the Atlanta firm Troutman Pepper found new evidence of Inman’s innocence and Hercules’s guilt, which they argued had been illegally withheld from Inman at trial. In the summer of 2019, Graham, the judge, granted an evidentiary hearing to consider claims that the state had violated Inman’s rights by withholding exculpatory evidence and that he’d received ineffective representation at trial. The AG fought back, arguing to the Georgia Supreme Court that Inman was procedurally barred from raising the constitutional violations at all.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court had previously refused to review Inman’s case after the DNA evidence first came to light. But this time, the court roundly <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/09/20/murderville-georgia-devonia-inman-justice/">rejected</a> the AG’s position, paving the way for the evidentiary hearing. In an extraordinary concurring opinion, then-presiding Judge David Nahmias expressed regret over the court’s earlier decision.</p>
<p>“During my decade of service on this court, I have reviewed over 1,500 murder cases in various forms,” Nahmias wrote. “Of the multitude of cases in which a new trial has been denied, Inman’s case is the one that causes me the most concern that an innocent person remains convicted and sentenced to serve the rest of his life in prison.”</p>

<h3>A Trove of Critical Evidence</h3>
<p>After repeated delays due to the pandemic, the evidentiary hearing finally took place at the Chattooga County Superior Court this June. In preparation for the hearing, Inman’s attorneys had been granted access to thousands of pages of records held by his former attorney Melinda Ryals, as well as permission to interview Hercules Brown. But when it came time for the deposition, <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/08/02/murderville-podcast-the-case-for-a-new-trial/">Hercules refused to be interviewed</a>.</p>
<p>At the start of the hearing, Graham said that she would draw an “adverse inference” from Hercules’s refusal to cooperate. In other words, she was going to consider Hercules’s silence as an indication that he was guilty of murdering Donna Brown. This is a quirk of civil law; although the Fifth Amendment would protect Hercules’s right against self-incrimination in a criminal proceeding, for the purpose of Inman’s appeal, such evidence was fair game.</p>
<p>The rest of the hearing focused on what Reilly, Inman’s lawyer, described as “two fundamental constitutional violations” that required Inman to be granted a new trial. First, there was the prosecution’s failure to turn over exculpatory evidence to Inman’s defense attorneys — what’s known as a <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1962/490">Brady</a> violation. Adel police reports showed that Hercules Brown had been arrested in September 2000 in connection with an attempted robbery at a local grocery store. Upon searching the car, police found a gun, crack cocaine, and homemade ski mask with eye holes cut out of it.</p>
<p>“The state had these police reports in the fall of 2000, many months before Mr. Inman’s trial in June of 2001,” Reilly told the judge. “But they concealed that.”</p>
<p>The second constitutional violation was the fact that Inman’s trial attorneys did a horrible job representing him. Although she was not Inman’s lead attorney at trial, Ryals had a critical job: investigating rumors that Hercules Brown was the real killer. One of the best ways to do this would have been to see if there was any link between Hercules and the mask found in Donna Brown’s car. But at the hearing, Ryals testified that she didn’t recall any testing being done on the mask before trial. In fact, she said she didn’t remember much about the mask at all.</p>
<p>Ryals’s failures were perhaps even more consequential after Inman’s trial. After his lead attorney left the case following Inman’s conviction, Ryals was charged with handling Inman’s direct appeal. As Inman’s pro bono attorneys discovered after going through her files, at some point Ryals did obtain at least one of the police reports about Hercules’s 2000 arrest for the attempted robbery. Yet “she did nothing with that information. She told no one about it,” Reilly told the judge. The documents would have been crucial to showing that the state withheld evidence that could have changed the outcome of Inman’s trial.</p>
<p>In fact, Reilly and his team found numerous pieces of critical exculpatory evidence in Ryals’s possession that she never used. This included handwritten notes from an interview after Inman’s trial with a man who said that Hercules had confessed to killing Donna Brown before Inman was arrested for the crime. This man was at least the third person whom Hercules had supposedly confessed to around the same time.</p>
<p>The hearing didn’t just reveal that Ryals failed to make use of such evidence as part of Inman’s appeal. After Inman repeatedly wrote to her from prison asking for the files in his case, to no avail, he filed a complaint with the Georgia State Bar. Asked to read from the complaint on the stand, Ryals became agitated. But she had no explanation for how she responded at the time. Asked if she ever provided the files to Inman, Ryals said, “Not to my recollection.”</p>

<h3>Fundamentally Unfair</h3>
<p>In her ruling overturning Inman’s conviction, Graham was unsparing in her view of Ryals’s performance. She had “professional and ethical duties” that she did not meet, Graham wrote. “The record demonstrates to this court that Ms. Ryals’ unprofessional errors deprived Mr. Inman of his constitutionally guaranteed right to effective assistance of counsel and undermines the court’s confidence in the outcome of the proceedings.”</p>
<p>Regarding prosecutors’ failure to disclose the police reports, Graham echoed what Reilly argued at the hearing: that the state had “repeatedly represented” to Inman’s defense that it had turned over all exculpatory evidence — and that there was “absolutely no evidence linking Hercules Brown to Donna Brown’s murder.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, Graham concluded that if the jury had known about the evidence presented at the hearing, Inman would not have been convicted of killing Donna Brown. “This court is convinced that the trial and post-trial proceedings against Mr. Inman were fundamentally unfair,” Graham wrote.</p>
<p>What happens next is up to the Georgia Attorney General. The office has 30 days to appeal Graham’s ruling. But given the Georgia Supreme Court’s previous ruling in the case, it’s hard to see how the AG would prevail. Nahmias, who wrote the impassioned 2019 opinion in favor of Inman, is now the court’s chief judge. Back then he made clear that the attorney general’s office should back down. “Let justice be done,” he wrote.</p>
<p>If the AG does not appeal, Inman’s case will wind up back at his trial court in Cook County, where the elected prosecutor, a former public defender, will decide whether to retry Inman or dismiss the case. A dismissal would be the “best-case scenario,” said Jessica Cino, a fierce advocate of Inman’s who has been fighting to help exonerate him since 2014.</p>
<p>Cino was a dean and professor at the Georgia State University law school when she first learned about Inman’s case. It is largely through her efforts that Inman ended up being represented by the Troutman Pepper attorneys who won this appeal. “What would be fantastic would be to have a hearing where the state just dismisses the charges,” Cino said. But given what she’s seen from the attorney general’s office over the past seven years, it seems more likely they will fight back. “I would not be surprised if they appealed it. I would love for them to step back, have a little bit of objectivity and say, you know, let’s just do a press release and say we disagree with the court but we’re not going to appeal it anymore,” she said. But until now, Cino said, the AG’s office has committed itself to an “untenable and indefensible position.”</p>
<p>Regardless, no one seems to think this will all end up in a new trial. The evidence against Inman was never strong to begin with — and with DNA evidence pointing to Hercules Brown, it is hard to imagine a jury convicting Inman for the same murder today. For Inman’s mother, Dinah Ray, the judge’s ruling brings her one step closer to bringing her son home. “The tears are rolling down and my heart is pumping so fast right now,” she wrote in a text message shortly after hearing the news. “Devonia is almost home.” When we spoke to her a short while later, she was still in tears. “They keep coming. We got so much to be thankful for this Thanksgiving.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>On the day</u> of Julius Jones’s clemency hearing, a crowd began gathering well before 8 a.m. at the Tabernacle Baptist Church on Oklahoma City’s northeast side. They were dressed for warmth, in winter hats, hoodies, and face masks that read “Justice for Julius.” Some, such as Abraham Bonowitz of <a href="https://deathpenaltyaction.org" target="_blank">Death Penalty Action</a>, were veteran anti-death penalty organizers. Others, like Eugene Smith, were new to the cause. Standing in the parking lot, Smith propped up a massive green banner featuring Jones’s face. It read “Are YOU Willing to Be the Innocent Person Executed?”</p>
<p>“We’re here to free an innocent man on death row,” Smith told me, adding that he wanted to raise awareness about other cases too. A few days earlier, on October 28, Oklahoma had carried out its first execution since 2015, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/oklahoma-lethal-drug-execution-john-marion-grant_n_617b21a1e4b066de4f6dd510" target="_blank">killing</a> a 60-year-old Black man named John Grant by lethal injection. Like the previous two men sent into the state’s death chamber — whose botched executions <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2016/05/24/oklahomas-insane-rush-to-execute/">thrust</a> Oklahoma’s dysfunctional capital punishment system into the national spotlight — Grant struggled before he died. Witnesses described how he vomited and repeatedly convulsed shortly after the lethal injection began. Yet officials denied that anything had gone wrong.</p>
<p>Now Jones faces the danger of a similar fate. Despite pending federal litigation over the state’s execution protocols — and a recommendation from the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board that Jones’s sentence be commuted to life in prison — Jones is scheduled to die on November 18 for a crime he swears he did not commit.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>Jones was sentenced to death in 2002 for killing a white man named Paul Howell in an affluent suburb of Oklahoma City. The case rested largely on a single eyewitness account, along with the testimony of two confidential informants. Although the alleged murder weapon was recovered from his parents’ home, Jones insists that he was framed by his co-defendant, a former high school classmate named Christopher Jordan, who testified against him in exchange for a secret plea deal. Jordan was released after 15 years in prison.</p>
<p>Jones’s case was relatively obscure outside Oklahoma until 2018, when ABC aired a seven-part documentary series titled “The Last Defense.” Produced by actor Viola Davis, it laid out the case for Jones’s innocence — and catapulted his name into the public eye. Recent <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/60099f1f6ffad96a2d94bf98/t/60dceba47c16d7741fcc90fc/1625090981118/Toplines_Oklahoma+Statewide+Poll_June+2021.pdf">opinion</a> <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a4fad76f09ca4f81252a595/t/5fe39613ecdd8f28ec9e493d/1608750612339/AI+OK+Statewide+-+Crosstab+Results+-+DECEMBER+2020+-+Public+Results.pdf">polls</a> taken from Oklahoma voters showed that 60 percent of those familiar with Jones believed that his death sentence should be commuted. Yet the publicity around his case has also sparked backlash from prosecutors and Howell’s family, who accuse Jones’s supporters of manipulating the public by misrepresenting the facts. After years of refusing interview requests, the family <a href="https://kfor.com/news/a-time-to-speak-family-of-paul-howell-discuss-man-they-loved-case-against-julius-jones/" target="_blank">told</a> a local TV station in September that they felt re-victimized by the celebrity-studded movement in support of Jones. “This is David versus Goliath,” Howell’s nephew said.</p>
<p>Around 8:15 a.m. on November 1, Rev. Cece Jones-Davis took the mic in the church parking lot. A minister and social justice activist, she had helped lead countless actions in Oklahoma City in the days before the clemency hearing. “What makes this different,” Jones-Davis told the crowd, “is that today Julius Jones gets to speak for himself.” After a prayer, the crowd turned out of the parking lot toward Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue. Chanting and waving signs, they passed the headquarters of Oklahoma’s Department of Corrections, then arrived at another church.</p>
<p>Cars parked outside had “Justice 4 Julius” written on the windows. A spread of fruit, granola bars, and honey buns was laid out under a blue tent. Rows of folding chairs were arranged to face a women’s prison across the street, the location where the hearing would take place. A large set of speakers sat ready to broadcast the proceedings. “Julius Jones is innocent!” a man shouted from the crowd.</p>

<h3>The Zeal to Kill</h3>
<p>Among the country’s dwindling death penalty states, Oklahoma leads the nation in executions per capita. Although the state reflects national trends in residents’ waning support for capital punishment — and in the declining number of death sentences imposed year after year — Oklahoma remains a bastion in its willingness to carry out executions. “If you look at the states that are outliers in their zeal to kill, they are also the states that are outliers in their failure to provide fair process,” said Robert Dunham, executive director of the <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org" target="_blank">Death Penalty Information Center</a>.</p>

<p>Apart from Jones, five more men are set to die in Oklahoma between December and March 2022. Lawyers for those men are fighting largely under the radar to save the lives of their clients, whose cases reveal longstanding flaws with the death penalty, from ineffective lawyering to prosecutorial misconduct. According to Assistant Federal Public Defender Emma Rolls, head of the capital habeas unit of the Western District of Oklahoma, these cases also reflect “systemic failures resulting in generations of unbelievable poverty, childhood deprivation, mental illness, addiction, and trauma.”</p>
<p>Perhaps more disturbing is Oklahoma’s determination to kill the men despite persistent problems with its execution protocols — problems officials claim to have worked diligently to fix. “Oklahoma has had six years to think about how not to botch an execution, and they squandered it,” said Dunham. In its rush to kill Jones, Oklahoma appears not only unbothered by its ugly death penalty history but also intent on repeating it.</p>
<p>In September 2015, Richard Glossip came <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2015/10/01/richard-glossip-execution-halted/">within moments</a> of being killed at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester when the execution was abruptly called off. Glossip swore he was innocent — and an <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2015/07/09/oklahoma-prepares-resume-executions-richard-glossip-first-line-die/">investigation</a> by The Intercept had found his conviction to be disturbingly flimsy, based almost solely on the account of a 19-year-old co-worker who admitted to killing the victim but blamed Glossip for coercing him. Yet Glossip’s execution wasn’t stopped due to the lingering questions about his guilt. Instead, prison officials explained that they had received the wrong drugs from their supplier, discovering the mistake at the last minute.</p>

<p>A grand jury report would later <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2016/05/24/oklahomas-insane-rush-to-execute/" target="_blank">expose</a> stunning incompetence and dishonesty on the part of state officials involved in the fiasco. Confronted with evidence that a man named Charles Warner had been previously executed using the same erroneously procured drug — his last words were “My body is on fire” — the governor’s general counsel pushed to kill Glossip anyway, lest they have to admit what had happened with Warner. Halting Glossip’s execution “would look bad for the state of Oklahoma,” he said.</p>
<p>Oklahoma had already made global headlines by then due to the horrifyingly botched execution of <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2015/04/30/lockettoneyearlater/" target="_blank">Clayton Lockett</a> in 2014. Nevertheless, in 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2015/06/30/justice-breyers-dissent-lethal-injection-showed-death-penaltys-defenders/" target="_blank">upheld</a> Oklahoma’s lethal injection protocol, setting the stage for Glossip’s execution. Following the mix-up at the prison, however, executions were placed on hold.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the ruling in Glossip greased the wheels of other states’ execution machinery. Prison officials adopted protocols employing the same sedative used by Oklahoma, midazolam, despite warnings from experts that the drug would not render a condemned person insensate for the purpose of execution. Even more significantly, Glossip largely <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2018/08/05/death-penalty-lethal-injection-trial-tennessee/" target="_blank">immunized</a> death penalty states from further challenges to their lethal injection protocols. Under the ruling, people on death row who wish to challenge a state’s execution method must not only prove that it is unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment but also propose a viable alternative. The ruling put death penalty lawyers in the perverse position of proposing methods by which the state could kill their clients.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>“Asking our clients to choose alternative methods for their own executions has been one of the most difficult experiences in my career,” said Rolls. “It is inimical to the instincts and beliefs of people committed to capital defense.” Still, this “pales in comparison to the anguish it has caused our clients. Many of our clients suffer from serious mental illness and cognitive limitations; they simply cannot understand how and why the law requires them to choose an alternative.”</p>

<p>In 2017, a special commission released a report that <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2017/04/26/innocent-people-have-been-sentenced-to-death-in-oklahoma-commission-concludes/">found</a> problems in every corner of Oklahoma’s death penalty system and urged the state to correct “systemic flaws” before restarting executions. Instead, Oklahoma merely tinkered with its methods. In 2018, then-Attorney General Mike Hunter <a href="https://www.oag.ok.gov/articles/attorney-general-hunter-corrections-director-allbaugh-announce-inert-gas-inhalation-primary" target="_blank">announced</a> that the state would start executing the condemned using nitrogen gas. But in February 2020, Hunter <a href="https://www.oklahoman.com/article/5654893/oklahoma-officials-to-give-update-on-executions">changed course</a>: Oklahoma would stick with the same three drugs it had used before but with “more checks and balances.” The drugs “have been successful in the past,” he said, “not only in Oklahoma but in numerous other states.”</p>
<p>For a while, both sides agreed that executions should remain paused pending federal litigation over the state’s revised lethal injection protocol. In July 2020, as required by Glossip, a group of men on death row outlined four alternative methods of execution, including the firing squad. But six of the plaintiffs did not answer an additional question. Prompted to check a box to indicate which execution method they would prefer, the six men left it blank.</p>
<p>This past August, U.S. District Judge Stephen Friot <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/oklahoma-federal-court-rules-that-death-row-prisoners-challenge-to-states-lethal-injection-protocol-may-proceed-to-trial" target="_blank">ruled</a> that the lethal injection lawsuit could proceed, scheduling a trial for February 2022. But in a dark technicality, he dismissed the six men who failed to choose their preferred way to die. In a footnote, Friot all but invited the state to set execution dates for these men. Noting that “the parties would be well advised to be prepared, at trial, to present evidence as to the actual track record of midazolam,” Friot added that in light of the six plaintiffs who “declined to proffer an alternative method of execution, there may well be a track record &#8230; by the time this case is called for trial.” In other words, the men could make useful test subjects to determine the efficacy of midazolam.</p>
<p>On September 20, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/oklahoma-court-of-criminal-appeals-sets-seven-execution-dates" target="_blank">issued</a> death warrants for all six men, including Jones. A seventh man, who was not part of the lawsuit, was also scheduled to die.<br />

<h3>Pointing Fingers</h3>
<p>Of the six men facing execution in the next few months, four, including Jones, were sentenced under former elected Oklahoma County District Attorney Robert “Cowboy Bob” Macy. Famed for aggressively seeking the death penalty — and infamous for prosecutorial misconduct — Macy, who served from 1980 to 2001, personally won 54 death sentences during his time in office.</p>
<p>The first man Macy ever put on death row, Clifford Henry Bowen, was accused of a triple murder based on the accounts of two eyewitnesses. After a dozen witnesses testified that Bowen was at a rodeo hundreds of miles away the night the crime took place, Macy <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/stories/cowboy-bob-ropes-wins-but-at-considerable-cost" target="_blank">suggested</a> that perhaps Bowen had taken a private jet from the rodeo to Oklahoma City. The jury sent Bowen to death row. He was <a href="https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/casedetailpre1989.aspx?caseid=27" target="_blank">exonerated</a> five years later.</p>

<p>To date, 11 people have been exonerated from Oklahoma’s death row, according to <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/12/03/death-penalty-capital-punishment-data/">data</a> collected by The Intercept. But the true number of innocence cases is impossible to know for sure. In 2001, as Jones waited to go on trial for his life, Oklahoma was forced to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/02/us/oklahoma-retraces-big-step-in-capital-case.html" target="_blank">review</a> some 1,200 criminal convictions won with the help of a fraudulent forensic scientist, whose work sent 23 people to death row. Twelve had already been executed.</p>
<p>Oklahoma County’s current district attorney, David Prater, worked under Macy. He has defended his old boss, arguing that it is inappropriate to view his record through a modern lens. But the culture and tactics of that office are reflected in the cases that are now coming up for execution, including Jones’s.</p>

<p>“I never trusted Bob Macy as far as I could throw him,” said Dennis Dill, a former police officer in Edmond, the Oklahoma City suburb where Jones was accused of killing Howell. Dill, who appeared in “The Last Defense,” is haunted by a different death penalty case tried under Macy — that of Jimmie Ray Slaughter, who was executed in 2005. In a phone call, Dill echoed what he said in the ABC series: that Slaughter was sent to death row by corrupt detectives who destroyed evidence and tried to get him to falsify a police report. Their conduct had moved him to speak up about Jones. “The same people that worked on this case worked on the Slaughter case,” he said. “They will focus on a direction and find only evidence to go that direction.”</p>

<p>Dill, who spent 24 years on the police force, was one of the first officers to respond to the murder of 45-year-old Howell on July 28, 1999. Howell, an insurance executive, had arrived at his parents’ home just after 9:30 p.m. after taking his young daughters out for ice cream when he was approached by a man as he was getting out of his GMC Suburban. The man shot him in the head at point-blank range. Howell’s sister, Megan Tobey, who was on the passenger side, glimpsed the shooter before fleeing the car with her nieces. She described him as a Black man in a white shirt and stocking cap, with a red bandanna covering his face. She said that she saw at least half an inch of hair coming out from under the cap.</p>
<p>Howell’s murder sent shockwaves through Edmond, where the majority of residents were white and well-off. A city council member and classmate of Howell’s described the neighborhood as a place where “getting a radio stolen out of a car would be a big deal.” For Black people, the city had a different reputation. “The Last Defense” includes an interview with a man who filed a lawsuit against the Edmond Police Department after a plainclothes officer allegedly put a gun to his head and called him the N-word. That officer, Tony Fike, investigated Howell’s murder alongside Edmond police detective Theresa Pfeiffer.</p>
<p>The stolen Suburban was found July 30 on Oklahoma City’s south side. When detectives approached a longtime confidential informant named Kermit Lottie, who owned a “chop shop” nearby, he pointed to a man named Ladell King, who had tried to sell him the Suburban. But King told detectives he was just a middleman. He said that on the night of the murder, two men had pulled up to his place driving separate cars: 20-year-old Jordan in an Oldsmobile Cutlass and 19-year-old Jones in the Suburban. It was only the next day after trying to sell the car that King said he saw a news report about Howell’s murder. He realized that the vehicle was linked to the murder — and that Jones was wearing a red bandanna and a stocking cap.</p>
<p>Dill, who said he was taken off the Howell case early on, remembers being skeptical. He was well acquainted with King, who had been an informant of his for years. “He knew if he started pointing fingers that he would get out of it,” Dill said.</p>
<p>Three days after the murder, Fike and Pfeiffer interviewed Jordan. There were signs that the detectives suspected Jordan might be the real shooter. “We don’t have this backward, do we?” Fike asked Jordan at one point. But the interview is most striking for how dramatically Jordan’s answers changed in response to detectives’ leading questions.</p>
<p>Jordan told detectives early on that he and Jones had been out together in the Cutlass the night of the murder when they spotted a Suburban driving behind them. Jones told Jordan to let him out of the car so he could “pop” it. Jordan said he did, then drove on to a taco place to get burritos. “I didn’t have nothing to do with it.”</p>
<p>But police told Jordan that his version of events didn’t make sense — or align with Howell’s known whereabouts that night. “He wasn’t in that part of town,” Pfeiffer said. Fike suggested that Jordan and Jones were out cruising around looking for a Suburban. Jordan denied it at first but then said it was true. As the detectives fed him more information, Jordan’s story evolved.</p>
<p>Where he’d previously said that he did not find out about Howell’s murder until the next day, now he said that he’d followed the Suburban into Howell’s neighborhood and let Jones out of the car. “So you followed him out, and you saw that man lying there on the ground, didn’t you?” Fike asked. Jordan said no, but Fike pressed him. “You saw him lying there, didn’t you? You knew he was shot right then, didn’t ya? Come on, Chris, you’re just a better witness that way.”</p>
<p>Jordan said he saw the man fall backward onto the ground. “How’d you know that he’d shot him? How’d you know he didn’t just hit him in the head or something and knock him down?” Fike asked, then answered his own question. “You heard the gun,” he told Jordan. “I heard the gunshot,” Jordan said.</p>

<h3>More Questions Than Answers</h3>
<p>By the time Jones’s trial began in 2002, the state’s theory was that Jones and Jordan had spotted the Suburban at an ice cream shop, then followed it to Howell’s parents’ home. Although Jordan never mentioned the ice cream shop to detectives, a man who was at the shop that night said he saw two Black men circling the parking lot. The driver had cornrows, like Jordan, and the other man wore a white shirt.</p>
<p>That man was among a slew of witnesses who took the stand against Jones at trial. But when it came time for the defense to present its case, Jones’s lead attorney, David McKenzie, called no witnesses. In an affidavit, McKenzie later said he had never tried a death penalty case before and “was terrified by this case due to my inexperience.” He admitted that he’d relied on an investigator who was “completely untrained and unqualified to be interviewing witnesses or otherwise performing investigative functions.” McKenzie also said he should have presented a key piece of evidence at trial: A photograph of Jones taken the week before the murder showed that Jones’s hair was cropped short — too short to match what Tobey, Howell’s sister, described.</p>
<p>Jones and his lawyers have long argued that if McKenzie had investigated Jones’s whereabouts on the night of the crime, he would have understood that Jones had an alibi. According to Jones’s family, Jones was at his parents’ home, eating spaghetti. In “The Last Defense,” his siblings recall how Jones got upset that they had eaten the rest of a leftover cookie cake from Jones’s birthday a few days before. His brother Antonio remembers that Jones was still there when their mother drove him to work. “I left, like, at 9:30 to go to work at 10 p.m.,” Antonio said. “There’s no way he could’ve skipped to Edmond and shot that guy at 9:30.”</p>
<p>Jones admits that he saw Jordan later that night. And he says that he did help move the Suburban, not on the night of the murder but the next day. According to Jones, King paged him looking for Jordan. When he could not reach him, King offered to pay Jones if he would help move the vehicle. Against his better judgment, Jones said, he agreed, but he refused to drive it. Regardless, Jones insists that he did not know what had happened to Howell. Later that night, Jordan spent the night in an upstairs bedroom at the home of Jones’s parents. It was there that police would find a .25 caliber gun wrapped in a red bandanna.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[13](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[13] -->“In a death penalty case of a Black man accused of killing a rich white guy, I don’t think there is any possible way you could have gotten a fair trial in Oklahoma City.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[13] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[13] -->
<p>In “The Last Defense,” lawyers for Jones emphasized the need to test the bandanna for DNA. They believed that the results could implicate Jordan. But when the bandanna was tested in the fall of 2018, DNA instead came back pointing at Jones. There were three other male DNA profiles detected, but they were too degraded to compare to known profiles. Today, Jones’s lawyers say that the DNA raises more questions than answers.</p>
<p>They also argue that junk science was used to convict Jones, like discredited bullet lead analysis provided by a former FBI analyst who later admitted to giving false testimony in a different case. And they point to the absence of other key physical evidence, like the lack of fingerprints linking Jones to the Suburban.</p>
<p>Finally, they emphasize the racism that animated Jones’s trial. Only a single Black juror served on the panel that convicted Jones. One juror has since come forward to say that a fellow juror referred to Jones using the N-word, saying that he ought to be shot and buried under the jail. As McKenzie put it following the verdict, “In a death penalty case of a Black man accused of killing a rich white guy, I don’t think there is any possible way you could have gotten a fair trial in Oklahoma City.”</p>
<p>With so many lingering questions, Dill, the former Edmond police officer, can’t say for sure who really killed Howell. He is certain, however, that Jones does not belong on death row. “Let’s put it this way: He did not get a fair trial. I know that for a fact,” he said. “And if you don’t get a fair trial, then how can you be guilty? So I have to say that he’s not guilty.”</p>

<h3>Invitation to an Execution</h3>
<p>In the months before Jones’s clemency hearing, members of the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board repeatedly showed that they tended to agree with Dill. In March, over the protests of the state’s attorney general, board members agreed to consider Jones’s application for a commutation — a rare chance “to remedy an excessive sentence,” as defined by the board. Following a hearing in September, they recommended reducing Jones’s sentence to life in prison with the possibility of parole by a vote of 3-1. But Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt declined to make a decision at the time, explaining that he would prefer to wait for a clemency hearing, which traditionally precedes an execution date and gives both victims’ families and the condemned a chance to speak.</p>
<p>The board’s actions enraged Prater, the Oklahoma County district attorney, who along with state officials has taken extreme <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/julius-jones-execution-parole-board-innocent_n_618c0d62e4b030921924f1c5">measures</a> to block the board from considering Jones’s case. In March, he sued both the governor and his appointed board members just days after the decision to allow a hearing. He then repeatedly petitioned the state Supreme Court to disqualify two board members from voting on both Jones’s commutation and clemency applications. In October, Prater convinced an Oklahoma County judge to convene a grand jury to investigate the parole board. Although Prater has repeatedly accused board members of having conflicts of interest, the move evinced a double standard: The judge who gave the green light was the husband of one of the prosecutors who sent Jones to death row.</p>
<p>At the clemency hearing on November 1, Antoinette Jones watched as her brother’s lawyers prepared to speak. She wore a “Justice for Julius” face mask along with a strand of pearls given to her by her mother. In the months leading up to the hearing, she had taken leave from school to focus on fighting for her brother. Now she prayed for everyone at the hearing — for the Howells, who had to relive their loved one’s murder, and for her family, who stood to lose their own. “It was a lot of tension. It was a lot of emotion,” Antoinette said. But it was nothing compared to growing up with her brother facing execution for a crime she knew he did not commit.</p>
<p>Jones’s attorney, Assistant Federal Public Defender Amanda Bass, emphasized three key pieces of evidence that Jones’s jury never saw. She reiterated that the photograph showing Jones’s short hair conflicted with the claim from Howell’s sister, Tobey, that there was half an inch to an inch of hair sticking out from under the shooter’s cap. Jordan, on the other hand, had cornrows, which would more closely match what she saw.</p>
<p>Second, Bass said, two of the state’s main witnesses — Lottie and King — were longtime confidential informants who had cut deals with the Oklahoma County district attorney in exchange for their cooperation. In fact, just a few years before implicating Jones, Lottie had helped that same office send two innocent defendants to death row. Those men were <a href="https://tulsaworld.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/millions-go-to-former-death-row-inmates-in-wrongful-conviction-settlement/article_ca4f89f6-8c47-5819-8661-2a52ce6fb269.html" target="_blank">exonerated</a> in 2009.</p>
<p>Finally, the jury never heard from multiple people who said that Jordan had bragged about killing Howell and letting Jones take the blame. Two men had spoken up around the time of Jones’s trial, after spending time with Jordan at the Oklahoma County jail. Two more came forward earlier this year. “The attorney general’s office has argued that none of these individuals are credible because they have felony convictions,” Bass said. “At the same time, they ask you to credit the testimony of the prosecution’s central witnesses against Julius.”<br />

<p>In response, a prosecutor with the state attorney general’s office reiterated the witness accounts presented at trial. She also emphasized something Tobey told the local TV station in September: that her description of the shooter’s hat and hair had been misconstrued for years. When she said she saw a half-inch to an inch of hair, Tobey meant the hair visible between the man’s ear and cap, not the length of the hair itself.</p>
<p>For all the debate about the hair, a fundamental fact cuts to one of the biggest problems at the heart of the case: Eyewitness descriptions, particularly cross-racial identifications, are notoriously unreliable and a <a href="https://innocenceproject.org/how-eyewitness-misidentification-can-send-innocent-people-to-prison/" target="_blank">leading</a> factor in wrongful convictions. Tobey’s account was based on what she saw in a moment of extreme panic, at night, as she frantically tried to escape the car with her nieces. Yet the state went so far as to insist that if Jordan were the real killer, Tobey would have been able to see “the outline of cornrows under the shooter’s cap.”</p>
<p>When it was time for the Howell family to speak, they were emotional, at times angry. Howell’s daughter, Rachel, who was only 9 years old when her father was murdered in front of her, said that she recalled waving to Jones before he shot her dad. She also read portions of a letter she said she had received from a defector from the Justice for Julius movement, who apologized for his role in misleading people about the case.</p>
<p>It was approaching noon when Jones spoke via video. In a maroon prison jumpsuit and glasses, he read from a prepared statement. He said he was sorry for Howell’s family. “My family and I never lost sight that they have lost a loved one.” But he maintained his innocence. “I’m here to tell you what I never got to tell the jury in my trial,” he said. “Yes, I’ve made many mistakes in my youth, but I did not kill Mr. Paul Howell.”</p>
<p>Around 12:30 p.m., the activists in the church parking lot gathered to listen to the vote. They bowed their heads and held hands. The board members spoke one by one. “I continue to believe that there is doubt in this case,” said Kelly Doyle, voting yes for clemency. Richard Smothermon, a former district attorney, voted no. Next came Larry Morris, who said both sides had given persuasive presentations. But to him, it was “not so much about his guilt or innocence” but the disparity between Jones’s sentence and Jordan’s. “To give one person 15 years and then execute the second one — there is something inherently wrong in that decision in my opinion.” He voted yes.</p>
<p>The last vote came from Chair Adam Luck. Yes. The final tally was 3-1. In the parking lot across the street, the crowd embraced and wiped tears from their faces. A woman went around giving hugs to strangers. But it was not over yet. The final decision would be up to the governor.</p>
<p>With the board now voting twice to spare her brother’s life, Antoinette hoped that Stitt would announce his decision swiftly. But two weeks later, she and her family are still waiting. In the meantime, a week after the clemency vote, she received a notice from the Oklahoma Department of Corrections asking her to fill out information for her attendance at her brother’s execution. “It’s so inhumane,” she said. “An invitation to an execution.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Brandie Jones was</u> in the yard at Arizona State Prison Complex Perryville, a women’s prison just west of Phoenix, when she got called into the office for important news about her dad. It was the summer of 2018. Her father, Barry Jones, was on death row. But now, after more than 23 years, a federal district judge had <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2018/08/01/barry-jones-arizona-death-row-conviction-overturned/">vacated</a> his conviction. The state of Arizona was ordered to release or retry him immediately.</p>
<p>Brandie was elated. She had not seen Jones since his 1995 trial for a crime he always swore he did not commit. In May 1994, Jones had been accused of killing his girlfriend’s 4-year-old daughter, Rachel Gray, at the Desert Vista Trailer Park in Tucson, where they all lived. The child died from an apparent blow to her abdomen that had torn her duodenum, part of the small intestine. Jones was swiftly arrested as the sole suspect. “I wasn’t even allowed to say bye to him or give him a hug,” recalled Brandie, who was 11 at the time. “And I never got to hug him again from that day on.”</p>

Photo: Arizona Federal Public Defender</p><!-- END-CONTENT(photo)[0] --></div><!-- END-BLOCK(photo)[0] -->Brandie never believed that her father had killed Rachel. She felt vindicated by the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4636294-Barry-Jones-Order-07-31-18.html">order</a> vacating his conviction, in which U.S. District Judge Timothy Burgess criticized law enforcement’s “rush to judgment” in the case. His decision followed a seven-day <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2018/02/09/arizona-death-row-barry-jones-evidentiary-hearing/">hearing</a> in Tucson’s federal courthouse in 2017, which largely dismantled the state’s evidence against Jones. Lead investigator Sonia Pesqueira admitted that she had taken no steps to investigate the timing of Rachel’s abdominal injury back in 1994, merely assuming that it had occurred the day before she died, when she had been spotted with Jones. But experts called by Jones’s lawyers said this was impossible. One doctor testified that there were “no reported cases in medical literature in which this type of injury has resulted in death in less than 48 hours.”</p>
<p>Such powerful exculpatory evidence would have almost certainly changed the outcome of Jones’s trial. But apart from Brandie, defense attorneys called no witnesses to counter the state’s theory of the crime. Burgess concluded that such poor lawyering violated Jones’s Sixth Amendment rights. Had Jones’s lawyers done their job, Burgess wrote, “there is a reasonable probability that his jury would not have convicted him of <em>any</em> of the crimes” that sent him to death row.</p>

<p>Brandie still remembers the stares from the courtroom as she took the stand in 1995. When the guilty verdict arrived, she felt like she’d let her father down. She spiraled after that. “I messed up a lot,” she said. “I was real angry, and I got into drugs.” At one point Brandie lost her leg after trying to jump onto a moving train and falling onto the tracks. As she cycled in and out of prison, Jones sent her letters, but she found it hard to write back. She was unable to cope with the knowledge that he would likely be executed one day.</p>
<p>Jones may well have been executed if not for an unexpected lifeline from the U.S. Supreme Court in a different Arizona case. The 2012 decision in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/10-1001.pdf">Martinez v. Ryan</a> carved out an exception to the strict rules that govern federal habeas appeals for people who received poor representation both at trial and in state post-conviction proceedings. The ruling paved the way to the evidentiary hearing — and to Jones’s vacated conviction.</p>

<p>Yet rather than release or retry Jones, the Arizona attorney general challenged Burgess’s order, first to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which sided with Jones, and then to the U.S. Supreme Court. In their <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1009/166813/20210120132000573_Ramirez%2520Jones%2520Petition.pdf">petition</a> to the high court this past January, Arizona prosecutors argued that Burgess and the 9th Circuit had wrongly applied the justices’ ruling in Martinez, opening a path to relief that should have remained closed. To the dismay of Jones’s legal team, on May 17, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/qp/20-01009qp.pdf" target="_blank">announced</a> that it would hear the case.</p>
<p>This time, Brandie heard the news from her dad. He tried to sound upbeat, but it was hard not to feel discouraged as she hung up the phone. Brandie had hoped to reunite with Jones after her own release from prison in 2018. Instead, three years have passed since Jones’s conviction was overturned, and he remains locked up. “He’s lost so much of his life. He doesn’t know any of his grandkids,” Brandie said. “It’s just being prolonged and prolonged and prolonged.”</p>
<p>To Assistant Federal Public Defender Cary Sandman, who has represented Jones for years, the state’s maneuvering in Jones’s case is disgraceful, if not surprising. With the bulk of the evidence supporting the conviction stripped away, prosecutors are banking on procedural gamesmanship and the Supreme Court’s newly powerful conservative majority to nullify the evidentiary hearing’s powerful revelations. “If Arizona’s attorney general has his way in the Supreme Court,” Sandman said, “all of the evidence of Jones’s innocence will be thrown out.”</p>

<h3>Manufacturing a Problem</h3>
<p>When a death penalty case reaches the Supreme Court, the question of actual innocence isn’t usually up for discussion. The court has previously made clear that even the wrongfully convicted should not expect to be spared. In <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1992/91-7328" target="_blank">Herrera v. Collins</a>, the court famously found that it is not necessarily unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment to execute an innocent person so long as they received a fair trial. The plaintiff in that case, Leonel Torres Herrera, was executed in Texas just four months later, proclaiming his innocence until the end.</p>
<p>While some may consider Jones’s innocence an open question, there’s no doubt that his trial was unfair. The evidentiary hearing proved it, and numerous federal judges have since concurred that Jones received ineffective assistance of counsel. But in its <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1009/183978/20210715130449330_Ramirez%20Jones%2020-1009%20Brief%20for%20Petitioners.pdf" target="_blank">brief</a> before the Supreme Court, Arizona argued that the evidence presented at the hearing should not count. If the justices agree, it will put Jones in a perilous position. While Arizona has been fighting to reinstate his conviction, Attorney General Mark Brnovich has been working to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/may/28/arizona-gas-chamber-executions-documents" target="_blank">restart</a> executions.</p>

<p>The implications go beyond Jones. In its petition to the Supreme Court, Arizona bundled Jones’s case with that of another man, David Martinez Ramirez, to argue that the 9th Circuit had repeatedly violated federal law in applying the Supreme Court’s 2012 decision in Martinez. Specifically, they pointed to a provision of the sweeping 1996 <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2016/05/04/the-untold-story-of-bill-clintons-other-crime-bill/">Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act</a> that forbids federal courts from granting hearings on claims that were never developed in state court. Thus, Jones’s case — known as Shinn v. Ramirez — pits AEDPA, a law designed to curtail federal review in capital cases, against Martinez, a ruling that sought to do the opposite, at least in a narrow set of circumstances.</p>
<p>But lawyers for Jones <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1009/173295/20210329184333568_2021.03.29%20Shinn%20Brief%20in%20Opposition.pdf" target="_blank">argue</a> that the two were never meant to be reconciled, and that Arizona prosecutors have tried “to manufacture a problem where none exists.” The real goal, they argue, is to undo the ruling in Martinez by weaponizing AEDPA, which has functioned for decades to prevent defendants from gaining access to federal courts — and to keep wrongful convictions intact.</p>
<p>“I see Shinn v. Ramirez as that kind of case where, because it is so hypertechnical, people don’t realize how far-reaching the effects of the rule would be,” said Lee Kovarsky, a leading death penalty and habeas corpus scholar at the University of Texas School of Law in Austin. To Kovarsky, who has argued before the Supreme Court and plans to file an amicus brief in support of Jones, the case is fundamentally about the right to counsel. “The question is about whether you can use evidence to prove these Sixth Amendment right-to-counsel claims in federal court — and if you cannot use evidence to prove the claim, then you don’t have a Sixth Amendment right that you can actually enforce.”</p>
<h3>A Crucial Exception</h3>
<p>The question before the court in Shinn is indeed legally complex. It’s also impossible to comprehend without first understanding the problem that Martinez was designed to correct. Under the Sixth Amendment, criminal defendants have a right to adequate representation at trial. Once they have been convicted and sentenced, they can challenge their case on the grounds that they received ineffective assistance of counsel. Proving this is a high bar — and under the strict rules governing federal appeals, this challenge must first be brought in state court or it will be barred from consideration in federal court, a concept known as “procedural default.”</p>
<p>This procedural rule routinely prevents people from challenging their convictions in federal court. But it has had especially high stakes in states like Arizona, where defendants are not allowed to challenge their trial lawyers’ performance on direct appeal, the initial review that immediately follows a conviction. They must instead wait until state post-conviction, the subsequent appellate proceeding, in which a defendant must prove that their constitutional rights were violated in order to win relief. Unlike at trial or direct appeal, there is no guarantee of an attorney, let alone a competent one, at the state post-conviction level. If a defendant failed to bring an ineffective assistance claim at this stage, they would lose their one chance to prove that bad lawyering made their trial unconstitutional.</p>
<p>This dilemma came to a head in 2012 in the case of an Arizona man named Luis Mariano Martinez. Convicted of sexually assaulting his 11-year-old stepdaughter, he swore he was innocent, and despite glaring errors by his trial attorneys, his appointed post-conviction attorney failed to challenge their performance. In fact, she did not bring any constitutional challenges on behalf of her client, instead stating that she had found no viable claims. For Martinez, who spoke limited English and did not understand the rules governing his appeals, the result was devastating.</p>

<p>Attorneys with the <a href="https://www.azjusticeproject.org/">Arizona Justice Project</a> appealed the case, Martinez v. Ryan, all the way up to the Supreme Court. The court had long <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/501/722/" target="_blank">held</a> that a post-conviction attorney’s failures were ascribed to their client — and that poor lawyering at this stage was not sufficient to excuse a procedural default. But in a 7-2 ruling that included Justices John Roberts and Samuel Alito, the court decided on an exception to protect defendants in states that barred them from asserting ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal. If such a defendant’s failure to bring a claim in state post-conviction proceedings was due to the fact that the post-conviction attorney, too, was ineffective, the procedural default could be excused.</p>
<p>Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy explained the need for such an exception. “When an attorney errs in initial-review collateral proceedings, it is likely that no state court at any level will hear the prisoner’s claim,” he wrote. This would fly in the face of their Sixth Amendment right to counsel — “a bedrock principle in our justice system.” Kennedy quoted a landmark Supreme Court <a href="https://sixthamendment.org/the-right-to-counsel/history-of-the-right-to-counsel/understanding-powell-v-alabama/" target="_blank">case</a> in spelling out what this could mean. In the absence of adequate counsel, even an innocent person “faces the danger of conviction because he does not know how to establish his innocence.”</p>
<p>Although limited in scope, the Martinez ruling was a big deal, a rare shift toward expanding the avenues for challenging a criminal conviction in federal court. Although there is no guarantee of winning on an ineffective assistance claim even in cases where lawyers did a horrible job, Martinez allowed defendants another shot in cases where they would have been otherwise barred on procedural grounds. “Before Martinez, our office lost many, many, many ineffective assistance cases because the claims were never raised in the state court,” Sandman said.</p>
<p>If there was any reason to worry that AEDPA might stand in the way, there had been no hint in the Supreme Court’s handling of Martinez. The opinion didn’t mention the law apart from a brief reference, in which Kennedy wrote that AEDPA “does not speak to the question presented in this case.” The reason seemed fairly logical: The point of Martinez was to give defendants a chance to pursue a “substantial” ineffective assistance claim that would have been otherwise prohibited. Since proving such a claim generally relies on new evidence, it would stand to reason that defendants who overcome the procedural barrier would then be able to air that evidence in court. In his opinion, Kennedy acknowledged as much: “Claims of ineffective assistance at trial often require investigative work” and “evidence outside the trial record,” he wrote<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>But Kennedy also wrote that Martinez “ought not to put a significant strain on state resources,” a prediction the Arizona attorney general insists has proven false. “Inmates, particularly in death-penalty cases, routinely invoke Martinez to excuse their ineffective-assistance claims’ procedural defaults,” the state argued in its petition to the court. The state cited 18 Arizona cases, not including Jones’s or Ramirez’s, that the 9th Circuit has sent back to district court under Martinez. “The 9th Circuit’s application of Martinez has … already had an onerous impact in Arizona and elsewhere,” the Shinn petition argued, adding, “This court’s intervention is critical at this juncture.”</p>

<h3>A Catch-22</h3>
<p>While Arizona prosecutors may consider it an intolerable burden when federal judges say that a capital case needs another look, the 9th Circuit’s actions in the wake of Martinez may be a sign of a different crisis: that poor lawyering has sent too many people to death row. Although Kennedy wrote in Martinez that “it is likely that most of the attorneys appointed by the courts are qualified to perform, and do perform, according to prevailing professional norms,” there is considerable evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for this is AEDPA, a law passed in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing, which took place the year Jones was convicted. Aimed at expediting the federal appeals process, it has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/17/magazine/the-law-that-keeps-people-on-death-row-despite-flawed-trials.html" target="_blank">notorious</a> for tying the hands of federal judges who try to undo wrongful convictions. But AEDPA also had an additional effect in Arizona — one that helps explain how Jones ended up where he is today. A lesser-known provision of the law offered to speed up federal habeas review even further in states willing to provide competent and well-compensated post-conviction counsel. Although no state successfully availed itself of this provision, Arizona tried. In a special session shortly after AEDPA was signed into law, the state Legislature passed a bill providing for the appointment of private lawyers for people appealing their death sentences, to be managed by the Arizona Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The system was an immediate failure. In a 1998 article for Arizona Attorney, the late Larry Hammond, co-founder of the Arizona Justice Project, raised alarm over the “crisis” that unfolded. “More than 200 letters were sent to attorneys by the court’s staff inviting them to apply for appointment as counsel,” he wrote. “In addition, advertisements were published in various legal publications. These solicitations generated only 16 applicants.” Of those applicants, only four met the qualifications required to represent people on death row.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[7](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[7] -->“I’ve seen post-conviction petitions that don’t have the client’s correct name or claims in them.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[7] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[7] -->
<p>To fix the problem, Arizona simply watered down the requirements, amending the Arizona Rules of Criminal Procedure to allow the state Supreme Court, in “exceptional circumstances,” to appoint an attorney “who does not meet the qualifications.” But the exception became the rule. Lawyers without the necessary experience or training were regularly assigned to handle death penalty cases in state post-conviction. In a phone call before he died, Hammond told me that many of these lawyers “simply didn’t raise claims. They didn’t raise ineffective assistance claims. They didn’t raise actual innocence claims. They didn’t raise prosecutorial misconduct claims. Often, they did next to nothing.” Despite numerous efforts to revamp it, the system has remained embattled. “I’ve seen post-conviction petitions that don’t have the client’s correct name or claims in them,” former Assistant Federal Public Defender Sylvia Lett, who previously represented Jones, told me in 2017.</p>
<p>Jones was just entering the post-conviction phase when AEDPA was signed into law. The shortage of attorneys kept him waiting for years. In 1998, he received a letter from the lawyer who had been appointed to represent him — the same attorney who would later represent Martinez — who told him that she was handing his case off to someone else. Almost a year later, in September 1999, Jones’s case was assigned to James Hazel.</p>
<p>Now a judge in Pinal County, Hazel conceded at Jones’s 2017 evidentiary hearing that he was not technically qualified to represent Jones in post-conviction. Although he sought funding for an investigator to dig into the evidence that should have been presented at trial, he’d been sloppy, filing his request under the wrong legal statute, thus disqualifying the request. “I don’t think the judge was going to grant it no matter what I put down on that piece of paper,” Hazel testified, which seemed to concern Burgess. “Why do you say that?” he asked. Hazel responded that “the culture at that time was that you didn’t get experts, you didn’t get investigators. … That was just how it was done.”</p>
<p>Jones’s case seemed like a perfect example of what Martinez was meant to remedy. Not only did his trial attorneys fail to investigate the medical evidence underpinning the state’s case, or call a single expert to debunk it, but his post-conviction attorney also failed to do the same thing. But Arizona prosecutors insisted that, under AEDPA, Burgess should not have been allowed to use Hazel’s testimony — or any evidence from the hearing — to vacate Jones’s conviction. Appearing before a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit in 2018, Assistant Arizona Attorney General Myles Braccio <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/08/13/arizona-death-penalty/">argued</a> that while it may have been appropriate for Burgess to use the newly developed evidence to conclude that there was “cause” to excuse the procedural default, that same evidence could not be used to decide the case on the merits.</p>
<p>The panel found this argument vexing. One judge called it “a Catch-22.” In November 2019, the judges ruled against Arizona — and the 9th Circuit subsequently refused to rehear the case en banc. But in a dissent, eight judges disagreed with the 9th Circuit’s decision. Six of them were Trump nominees. Writing for the dissenters, one of them, Judge Daniel Collins, called out his colleagues for their ruling not only in Jones’s case but also in Ramirez’s, which had been decided that same year. Collins argued that AEDPA should have prohibited evidentiary development in both cases, even if it meant that no federal court would be able to consider evidence of ineffective lawyering. “To the extent that it seems unfair that a potentially meritorious claim might escape federal habeas review,” he wrote, “that feature is inherent in the restrictions that AEDPA imposes on the grant of federal habeas relief.” In other words, it didn’t matter how egregiously Jones’s lawyers might have failed him — or how much evidence might point to his innocence. Jones should never have been allowed back into federal court.</p>
<h3>Perpetual Uncertainty</h3>
<p>The oral argument in Shinn has yet to be scheduled. The soonest it will happen is November. Whether it will take place remotely remains to be seen. “If there’s any chance possible that I can attend in person, I would definitely 100 percent do that,” Brandie said. If not, “I definitely will be attached to the screen while all that’s going on.”</p>
<p>Legal scholars, capital habeas lawyers, and people on death row will be watching the case closely too. For many of them, the court’s decision to hear the case was an unnerving step backward. “Martinez has allowed many more habeas courts to actually probe the merits in ineffective assistance of counsel claims than was true before,” said University of Michigan law professor Leah Litman, co-creator of the Supreme Court <a href="https://strictscrutinypodcast.com/" target="_blank">podcast</a> “Strict Scrutiny.” She fears that it’s “a very bad indication that the court is effectively going to close off that window by saying AEDPA’s limits on collecting new evidence apply if you are trying to make use of the Martinez procedural gateway.” Such a decision would “dramatically, dramatically undermine the ability of federal courts to make use of that exception.”</p>
<p>For Jones, who has struggled with depression during his decades on death row, one of the hardest parts of the court’s decision to take his case is that it keeps him in a place of perpetual uncertainty. In the past year, he has seen incarcerated neighbors die from Covid-19. One of them, <a href="https://kjzz.org/content/1550881/arizona-death-row-inmate-dies-complications-covid-19" target="_blank">Alfonso Salazar</a>, had been waiting on a ruling in his own case after getting back into federal court thanks to the ruling in Martinez.</p>
<p>Jones, who is now in his 60s, got sick himself early in the pandemic. But he was never tested for the virus. After 26 years in prison, he worries he is running out of time. In their most recent phone calls, Brandie has tried to keep Jones’s spirits up. “I tell him, ‘Don’t say negative things, Dad, because you’re putting negative things into the universe. I know it’s hard … but let’s not give up hope.’”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>On a rainy</u> Wednesday afternoon in late March, a stream of cars pulled up to a checkpoint at the Greensville Correctional Center, just outside the rural town of Jarratt, Virginia. An employee with the Virginia Department of Corrections inspected driver’s licenses and took temperatures, then waved each vehicle up a narrow road toward the parking lot, where reporters waited for the governor to arrive.</p>
<p>The media had visited this parking lot many times before. Since 1991, the year Virginia’s death chamber was moved to Greensville from the old state penitentiary in Richmond, more than 100 people had been executed inside the prison. There was Roger Coleman, whose vociferous claims of innocence before his 1992 execution were <a href="https://innocenceproject.org/dna-results-in-coleman-case-finally-reveal-the-truth-in-one-case-but-dont-answer-serious-doubts-about-the-fairness-of-the-criminal-justice-system-innocence-project-says/" target="_blank">debunked</a> years later by DNA. There was John Allen Muhammad, known as one of the Beltway snipers, who terrorized the D.C. area before being <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/metro/specials/muhammad/" target="_blank">executed</a> in 2009. And there was Teresa Lewis, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/aug/21/teresa-lewis-death-row" target="_blank">killed</a> the following year for a double murder for hire — and the sole woman to die in Virginia’s death chamber in nearly a century.</p>
<p>Now reporters gathered in the same parking lot for a very different event. In a milestone that seemed to catch lawmakers themselves by surprise, Virginia had <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-death-penalty-abolish/2021/03/23/64a5a8fa-88dc-11eb-8a8b-5cf82c3dffe4_story.html" target="_blank">become</a> the first Southern state to abolish the death penalty. The signing ceremony put racial justice front and center, casting the death penalty as a historical relic <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2018/06/17/lynching-museum-alabama-death-penalty/" target="_blank">rooted</a> in slavery and lynching. Introducing Gov. Ralph Northam, his chief legal counsel, Rita Davis, greeted the attendees with a quote from Martin Luther King Jr. “The arc of the moral universe is long,” she said. “But today, in the Commonwealth of Virginia, it bends sharply towards justice.”</p>

<p>Among those gathered inside the tent was Dale Brumfield, a local author and field organizer for <a href="https://www.vadp.org" target="_blank">Virginians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty</a>. His most recent book, “Railroaded,” <a href="https://www.styleweekly.com/richmond/railroaded/Content?oid=16882855" target="_blank">profiles</a> the first 100 people killed in Virginia’s electric chair, 87 of whom were Black. One was a teenage girl, executed in 1912 on her 17th birthday. In a <a href="https://www.styleweekly.com/richmond/lights-out/Content?oid=17211744" target="_blank">story</a> for Richmond’s alt-weekly, Brumfield linked these killings, little more than legal lynchings, to the first executions in the so-called modern death penalty era. On the night that Linwood Briley was executed in 1984, for example, a white mob reveled outside, “shouting racial epithets and waving homemade signs declaring such racist invectives as ‘kill the negro,’ ‘fry Briley fry,’ and far worse,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Brumfield echoed what others have said about the abolition law: “It happened way sooner than I ever thought it would,” he said. Although there were several contributing factors — the Democratic <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/this-is-what-a-blue-state-looks-like-rapid-change-roils-virginia-republicans/2020/01/26/de8aa188-3d75-11ea-b90d-5652806c3b3a_story.html" target="_blank">takeover</a> of the legislature key among them — everyone agreed that one event had fueled the urgency around abolition: the killing of George Floyd in May 2020. The unprecedented <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/collections/protests-for-black-lives/">wave of protests</a> not only led to the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/07/19/confederate-statues-monuments-local/">toppling</a> of 26 Confederate monuments in Virginia between May and September, but also “turbocharged criminal justice reform in Virginia across the board,” said VADP Executive Director Michael Stone.</p>
<p>Northam had called a special session to be held in August, which was intended to tackle budget challenges due to Covid-19. Instead, criminal justice reform <a href="https://www.wdbj7.com/2020/08/20/criminal-justice-reforms-front-and-center-on-day-two-of-special-session/" target="_blank">dominated</a> the session. Lawmakers brought a slew of bills aimed at police accountability, sentencing reform, and racial justice. Politicians who had theoretically supported but never acted on abolition legislation decided they were ready to pass a bill during the regular session. “The whole Black Lives Matter movement suddenly made it a priority,” Stone said.</p>
<p>It didn’t hurt that the governor himself had something to prove when it came to his commitment to racial justice. Northam faced calls to resign in 2019 after a photo emerged from an old yearbook that appeared to show him in blackface. Compounding his disastrous response to the controversy — first apologizing, then denying it was him in the photo — Northam then held a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/northam-press-conference-789192/" target="_blank">press conference</a> in which he admitted to having worn shoe polish on his cheeks to imitate Michael Jackson and almost did the moonwalk on stage.</p>
<p>Now the governor was invoking the racist history of capital punishment. Of the 377 people executed for murder in Virginia between 1900 and 1999, 296 were Black. “The racism and discrimination of our past still echoes in our systems today,” Northam said. He cited the case of <a href="https://innocenceproject.org/cases/earl-washington/" target="_blank">Earl Washington Jr.</a>, a Black man sentenced to death in 1984 for a crime he did not commit. After giving a coerced confession, Washington came within days of execution only to be exonerated in 2000. “Can we really, truly be sure that there aren’t others?” the governor asked.</p>

<p>Northam introduced Scott Surovell, the bill’s lead sponsor in the state Senate. Surovell had toured Greensville in the early 1990s as a governor’s fellow straight out of college. He remembered seeing the electric chair “sitting right there in the middle of the room. And I can’t tell you the impact it has on you &#8230; to see that device, to have to think about how many people sat in it.” He recalled a sense of revulsion and shame. “I never thought I’d be back here today doing this, I can tell you that.”</p>
<p>As the bill’s sponsors spoke, Kenneth Plum sat a few feet away in the audience. The longest serving member of Virginia’s House of Delegates, Plum was first elected in 1977, the year after the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1975/74-6257" target="_blank">Gregg v. Georgia</a> ushered in the “modern” death penalty era in the United States. Over the next three decades, Plum tried to push back against the death penalty but was stymied by politics. “So much of the discussion about it was whether or not you could get reelected if you voted to get rid of it,” Plum recalled in a phone call after the signing. “And when I look back on this, it’s disappointing to realize that that was the driving force for keeping it in place for a lot of people.”</p>
<p>Plum had driven four hours for the signing ceremony. “I haven’t been to another bill signing since the pandemic,” he said. Virginia was on a roll passing progressive legislation, but this one was especially meaningful. “It was kind of like, ‘I’ll be damned. I think we did this.’”</p>

<h3>Careers Built on Capital Punishment</h3>
<p>The end of the death penalty in Virginia is part of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/26/books/review/let-the-lord-sort-them-death-penalty-maurice-chammah.html" target="_blank">larger</a> and now <a href="https://search-api.swiftype.com/api/v1/public/installs/pc/n6TvC2gwwcAyQcJnnYfJ.json?_st_tracking%5Bdoc_id%5D=5e55323164441f28dcd895ac&amp;_st_tracking%5Bquery%5D%5Bq%5D=decline%20death%20penalty&amp;_st_tracking%5Bquery%5D%5Bpage%5D=2&amp;_st_tracking%5Bquery_type%5D=search&amp;_st_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeathpenaltyinfo.org%2Fresources%2Fpodcasts%2Fdiscussions-with-dpic%2Fdiscussions-with-dpic-the-decline-of-the-death-penalty-over-the-past-25-years-with-brandon-garrett" target="_blank">familiar</a> story nationwide. Like almost every other jurisdiction in the country, Virginia had already seen a sharp decline in new death sentences and executions. Thanks in large part to a network of regional capital defender offices that <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/how-capital-defenders-helped-end-virginias-death-penalty" target="_blank">vastly improved</a> the lawyering done in death penalty cases, there had not been a new death sentence since 2011.</p>
<p>Still, it is hard to overstate the significance of Virginia’s abolition law. Counting executions in the colonial era, the commonwealth carried out more executions than any state in the U.S. — and was second only to Texas in the number of people put to death in the modern era. This was largely due to an appellate process designed to swiftly send defendants to the execution chamber. Virginia had the dubious <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/daily/april99/penalty4.htm" target="_blank">distinction</a> of killing the condemned faster than any jurisdiction in the nation.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[3] -->Virginia had the dubious distinction of killing the condemned faster than any jurisdiction in the nation.<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[3] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[3] -->
<p>Virginia was also a case study in the death penalty as a bipartisan project. Of the 113 killings carried out since the state resumed executions in 1982, 47 were overseen by Democratic governors. The last three executions were approved by former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who most recently denied clemency to <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2017/06/27/will-virginia-execute-a-man-whose-crimes-were-driven-by-delusions/">William Morva</a>, a man with severe mental illness. In the years since Morva’s execution, the daughter of one of his victims had become a <a href="https://theappeal.org/victims-families-want-virginia-to-end-the-death-penalty/" target="_blank">vocal critic</a> of capital punishment.</p>
<p>As in other states, Virginia’s modern death penalty law was once supposed to be reserved for a narrow class of murders. After lawmakers revised the statute in the wake of the landmark 1972 Supreme Court ruling in Furman v. Georgia, which declared the death penalty unfairly and thus unconstitutionally applied across the country, lawmakers immediately started adding crimes to the list of offenses that made a defendant eligible for death. Between the late 1970s and the end of the 1990s, lawmakers voted to expand the death penalty over a dozen times, to include offenses ranging from the murder of a police officer to the murder of a child under 14 years old by a person over the age of 21.</p>
<p>Few politicians were as aggressive in pushing these laws as the elected prosecutors who made up the Virginia Association of Commonwealth’s Attorneys. For years, the group “routinely opposed any kind of death penalty reform legislation,” recalled Stone. But over the past decade, Virginia voters <a href="https://www.portsmouthcwa.com/commonwealths-attorney" target="_blank">began</a> electing commonwealth attorneys who <a href="https://theappeal.org/politicalreport/virginia-prosecutors-form-progressive-alliance/" target="_blank">ran</a> on promises of criminal justice reform. As Stone recalled, “we ended up getting the support of 12 commonwealth attorneys in support of abolition,” including those representing counties that once <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/crime/vp-nw-progressive-prosecutors-20210104-i3zgfbrvqjag5nxzkuaalu52ny-story.html" target="_blank">routinely</a> sent defendants to death row. With their members divided on the matter, VACA stayed silent on the abolition bill.</p>
<p>Among the new crop of commonwealth attorneys was Amy Ashworth, who replaced famed Prince William County prosecutor Paul Ebert after he retired in 2018. During Ebert’s five decades in office, he won 13 death sentences, making the county one of the country’s top death penalty jurisdictions. In a sign of the times, Ebert failed to win a death sentence in his final murder trial, later <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/hes-sent-more-killers-to-death-row-than-any-va-prosecutor-but-not-this-time/2018/11/03/7873fbbe-dd32-11e8-b3f0-62607289efee_story.html" target="_blank">musing</a> to the Washington Post that the county had changed. “The demographics of Prince William were relatively conservative all those years and much more pro-death,” Ebert said. “And I always knew someone on the jury. Now, I seldom know someone on the jury.”</p>
<p>Like numerous prosecutors of his generation who built careers on capital punishment, Ebert reveled in his tough-on-crime reputation. He also exemplifies the lack of accountability for prosecutors who abused the power they wielded against defendants. Ebert presided over one of Virginia’s most egregious death penalty cases in recent memory: that of Justin Wolfe, who was just 19 years old when he was arrested for a murder he <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2009/03/01/an-innocent-man-on-death-row/" target="_blank">swore</a> he did not commit. Wolfe spent more than a decade on death row insisting on his innocence before ultimately taking a plea deal. For Wolfe and countless others whose lives were shaped by Virginia’s death penalty system, abolition does not bring their ordeal to a close.</p>

<h3>A Bittersweet Victory</h3>
<p>Wolfe’s mother, Terri Steinberg, was at home in Fairfax the day the bill was signed. A dedicated activist who traveled the country with an abolitionist group called the <a href="https://www.journeyofhope.org" target="_blank">Journey of Hope</a>, she’d hoped to be at the signing ceremony but was unable to make the trip. Although Steinberg was overjoyed at the news that the legislation had passed, the victory was bittersweet. The same week Northam signed the bill into law, her son turned 40 years old behind bars.</p>
<p>Steinberg has told her story countless times. Her oldest son, Justin, started selling marijuana while in high school. In 2001, a former classmate named Owen Barber killed another drug dealer named Daniel Petrole, the son of a former Secret Service agent, then claimed he carried out the murder at Wolfe’s command. After a three-week trial that leaned heavily on Barber’s self-serving testimony, Wolfe was sentenced to die.</p>
<p>After years of denying that Wolfe had ordered Barber to kill anyone, Wolfe and his lawyers discovered a police report that Ebert had hidden from the defense at trial. It showed how a Prince William County detective had coerced Barber into blaming Wolfe for the murder by threatening him with the death penalty. In an evidentiary hearing in 2010, Barber testified that “they said they wanted the truth, but at the same time, they said that this is what you have got to say or you are getting the chair.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[5](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22left%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-left" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="left"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[5] -->“They said they wanted the truth, but at the same time, they said that this is what you have got to say or you are getting the chair.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[5] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[5] -->
<p>Such <a href="https://theappeal.org/the-epidemic-of-brady-violations-explained-94a38ad3c800/" target="_blank">violations</a> are not uncommon in death penalty cases — nor do they necessarily lead to new trials. But the police report was not the only evidence that Ebert had failed to disclose. In fact, at the same hearing, Ebert defended his misconduct by essentially explaining that his office did not have an “open file” policy for a reason: He did not want defense attorneys to have evidence that might exculpate their client. In his experience, he testified, “when you have information that is given to certain counsel and certain defendants, they are able to fabricate a defense around what is provided.”</p>
<p>In 2011, U.S. District Judge Raymond Jackson <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/va-judge-throws-out-drug-dealers-death-sentence-in-slaying/2011/07/12/gIQArNRXBI_story.html" target="_blank">found</a> Ebert’s conduct “not only unconstitutional in regards to due process, but abhorrent to the judicial process,” vacating Wolfe’s conviction. Although the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Jackson’s order in 2012 — lambasting Ebert’s “flabbergasting explanation” for withholding exculpatory evidence — the commonwealth refused to give up. A few days after the ruling, Ebert visited Barber in prison, accused him of violating his plea deal, and told him that a revocation of the agreement would leave him eligible for the death penalty himself. “In effect, they applied the same pressure that had been applied before Wolfe’s trial,” <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2014/11/justin-wolfe-case-his-murder-conviction-was-vacated-three-years-ago-so-why-is-he-still-in-prison.html" target="_blank">wrote</a> Slate’s legal correspondent Dahlia Lithwick, who followed the case for years.</p>
<p>Things only got worse from there. After Jackson decried Ebert’s attempts to pressure Barber — and ordered Wolfe’s release in December 2012 — Ebert appealed again. This time, the 4th Circuit found that the judge was wrong. While Wolfe remained in jail, prosecutors revamped their case, casting him as a kingpin in a “continuing criminal enterprise” and bringing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/prosecutors-can-pursue-drug-charges-in-justin-wolfe-case-in-pr-william-court-rules/2013/11/15/287030d2-4e09-11e3-9890-a1e0997fb0c0_story.html" target="_blank">new charges</a> against him — a number of which carried the death penalty. Steinberg went from shopping for new clothes in anticipation of her son’s homecoming to facing a brand-new death penalty trial.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[6](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[6] -->“He watched so many of his friends on death row go through the mental break caused by solitary and was starting to feel some of that himself.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[6] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[6] -->
<p>By then, Steinberg was watching her son increasingly struggle. The trauma of death row and multiple execution dates had been hard enough. Now he was languishing in isolation at the Prince William County jail with no end in sight. “When the case was vacated, it went back to Virginia to be retried within 120 days,” Steinberg said. “And before you know it, it was four years. … He had gotten to the point where he had started to feel the effects of solitary confinement. He watched so many of his friends on death row go through the mental break caused by solitary and was starting to feel some of that himself.”</p>
<p>In March 2016, Steinberg sat down to write an email to friends and fellow activists. The subject was “Justin.” She thanked them for their support over the previous 15 years and told them she wanted them to hear what she was going to share from her rather than through the press or social media. Prosecutors in Wolfe’s case had offered him a plea, and he had decided to take it. Rather than face the threat of a new death sentence — or another decade of appeals — he agreed to plead guilty to first-degree murder and was <a href="https://www.insidenova.com/headlines/justin-wolfe-sentenced-to-serve-41-years-in-prison-for-2001-murder/article_56069f46-4eb9-11e6-b89d-d3318f6e5778.html" target="_blank">resentenced</a> to 41 years in prison.</p>
<p>“I was devastated,” Steinberg recalls. She did not read her son’s handwritten, four-page statement until it was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2016/03/29/justin-wolfe-admits-role-in-drug-dealers-slaying-enters-guilty-plea-after-stint-on-death-row/" target="_blank">published</a> by the Washington Post, which called it a “stunning reversal” that “essentially validated the prosecution’s consistent version of events.” In fact, Steinberg said, although the letter was supposed to be in her son’s words, he told her he’d been made to rewrite it numerous times to satisfy prosecutors.</p>
<p>“Justin took this plea under such duress,” Steinberg said. A new legal team has since challenged Wolfe’s plea deal, arguing that he was coerced by vindictive prosecutors. In 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/crime-law/2019/01/08/supreme-court-orders-va-hear-appeal-justin-wolfe-who-pleaded-guilty-murder/" target="_blank">ordered</a> Virginia to grant a hearing on the matter, but it has yet to be resolved.</p>
<p>On the day the final vote came down to end capital punishment in Virginia, Steinberg was at work, unable to follow the vote. It was only when an activist friend called her and said “It’s done” that she started to cry. “There was just tears of relief, joy, sadness.” She sent a message to her son right away. “He called me within a half an hour,” she said. “And we celebrated on the phone.”</p>
<p>At the prison where he is currently incarcerated, Wolfe works in the area that receives new transfers. Steinberg says her son hopes he’ll have a chance to see the two remaining men on death row once they are reclassified and moved. One of them has an innocence claim that she hopes will lead to his conviction being overturned. “But,” Steinberg said, “the system doesn’t always work the way it’s supposed to.”</p>
<h3>You’re Saving All of Us</h3>
<p>In all, 18 people were executed in Virginia while Wolfe was on death row. Among them were friends who had tried to help him adjust to his surroundings. When Wolfe first arrived at Sussex State Prison at age 21, Steinberg recalled, “someone had put together a brown paper bag full of candy bars, soap, magazines — things that he would need when he first got there, because he had nothing.” The welcome package had been arranged in part by Dennis Orbe, who would be <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2004/04/01/va-executes-killer-after-efforts-for-reprieve-fail/27d86660-04aa-47f8-828e-ac90eff3b4e6/" target="_blank">executed</a> in 2004. On the night he was killed, Steinberg drove Orbe’s spiritual adviser to Greensville and back.</p>
<p>Just as her son had forged unlikely friendships with his neighbors, Steinberg found community among the activists and loved ones who fought for the condemned. She spent hours on the road with the grandmother of Ricky Gray, who was 80 years old and had diabetes but was nonetheless determined to see her grandson before she died; Gray was executed in 2017. Before Virginia executed John Allen Muhammad in 2009, she got a letter thanking her for raising a son as compassionate as Wolfe, along with her work against the death penalty. “I know you got into this to save your son, but ultimately, you’re saving all of us,” Muhammad wrote.</p>
<p>One of the last people to be executed before Wolfe left death row was Teresa Lewis. As the only woman under a death sentence in Virginia, she was held inside one of the isolation wings at the Fluvanna Women’s Correctional Center, almost two hours away from Greensville. Shortly after Lewis was executed in September 2010, Steinberg was on a panel with Lewis’s defense attorney, James Rocap. “He was so broken by it all,” she recalled. “I really thought they would be able to save her.”</p>
<p>Rocap is a lawyer handling civil cases at a firm in Washington, D.C. In a phone call following the signing ceremony, he recalled the many problems with Lewis’s case. Lewis was convicted in 2002 for paying two men to kill her husband, Julian, and his 25-year-old son, Charles. Although she quickly confessed to having arranged the murders in order to collect insurance money — and was portrayed as the mastermind behind the crime — questions emerged about the commonwealth’s theory. Lewis was evaluated by an expert who said her intellectual functioning placed her among the “lowest 3% of our society.” In 2004, one of the gunmen, Matthew Shallenberger, who later died by suicide, admitted to an investigator that the plan had been “entirely my idea” and that he had manipulated Lewis, who was in love with him, “eager to please me,” and “not very smart.”</p>
<p>“She was basically duped,” Rocap said. “Was she a member of the conspiracy? Yes, she was a member of the conspiracy. … Was she responsible in the same way that someone who intentionally, and purposely, and so on, commits a horrific crime like this? No, she wasn’t.”</p>
<p>Lewis’s execution attracted attention well beyond Virginia. Novelist John Grisham wrote an <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/new-voices-john-grisham-asks-why-is-teresa-lewis-on-death-row" target="_blank">op-ed</a> calling for clemency. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad invoked the case in a speech in New York, accusing Americans of hypocrisy for raising cries against the death sentence of an Iranian woman found guilty of adultery while appearing to ignore the case of Lewis. Although they did not receive as much publicity, the most sincere and heartfelt appeals came from the women who had gotten to know Lewis behind bars.</p>

<p>In solitary confinement at Fluvanna, Lewis encountered other women who had been sent to the segregation unit. “They would be next door to her, and she would be able to talk to them through the walls,” Rocap said. In a clemency petition he sent to then Gov. Bob McDonnell in advance of Lewis’s scheduled execution, Rocap included numerous letters describing how Lewis had become a counselor and religious mentor to the women she met.</p>
<p>A library worker who brought books to the segregation building recalled giving Lewis a red hymnal that had been donated. “I heard stories from other inmates about how she would calm the cell block at night — one needs to understand the hysteria and craziness that goes on there at night — by talking to any inmate who was hysterical and then singing her hymns of comfort and joy,” she wrote. “It was the only way they survived their time in that horribly punishing environment.” Another woman recalled how she’d gotten through a particularly upsetting moment by singing “Angel” by Sarah McLachlan with her. For Lewis to be executed, she wrote, “a lot of women in the future will not have the blessed opportunity to be encouraged by her.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[8](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[8] -->The decision to kill a woman who was not only remorseful but also clearly doing more good than harm was emblematic of the death penalty’s cruelty and irrationality.<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[8] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[8] -->
<p>McDonnell rejected Lewis’s petition. To Rocap, the decision to kill a woman who was not only remorseful but also clearly doing more good than harm was emblematic of the death penalty’s cruelty and irrationality. In a testimonial he wrote after she was killed, Rocap recalled the last day of his client’s life, how she visited with her son and spoke on the phone with her daughter, later “consoling and encouraging those of us who had come to try to console and encourage her. She did not need it; we did.”</p>
<p>In her final moments, Lewis asked Rocap to pray with her and her spiritual adviser, prison chaplain Julie Perry. Separated by bars in a cell adjacent to the hallway that led to the execution chamber, “the three of us joined hands through the meal tray slot, awkwardly at first,” Rocap wrote. “Her left hand was cradled in both of mine.” At 8:45 p.m., prison guards came and tapped his shoulder, saying, “It’s time.”</p>
<p>A Washington Post reporter would later <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/crime-scene/maria-glod/three-weeks-ago-i-met.html" target="_blank">describe</a> Rocap and Perry looking “crushed and exhausted” as they entered the witness area. Lewis was brought inside the execution chamber, “ushered by guards in blue uniforms who held her elbows.” The curtains closed while officials inserted the intravenous lines then reopened to show Lewis lying on the gurney, her arms outstretched. She asked if the daughter of her slain husband was present, then apologized. “I just want Kathy to know that I love you and I’m very sorry,” she said.</p>
<p>Rocap was struck by his client’s courage and faith before her death. But he describes the execution as an act of madness. “I just can’t imagine how anybody could be there and watch what happened, no matter who the person was, and come away thinking, ‘Yeah, that was good. &#8230; That is what we should be doing,’” he said. Afterward, he remembers telling people that more Americans should witness executions to see what was being done in their names.</p>
<p>Rocap was not directly involved in the abolition legislation. When it passed, he remembers saying to himself, “Why didn’t they do this 15 years ago, before Teresa’s case?” Although the case does not haunt him as frequently as it used to, memories of the execution return at unexpected times. He recalls some years back watching an episode of “The Good Wife” that began with a scene involving an execution chamber. “It wasn’t in Virginia, but it looked identical to the death chamber in Virginia,” he said. “I was watching it with my wife, and I literally had to get up and walk out of the room.”</p>

<h3>The Executioner’s Trauma</h3>
<p>Of all those impacted by the executions in Virginia, perhaps no one carried more complex trauma than the people who carried them out. Jerry Givens executed 62 of the 113 people killed in the death chamber only to become a vocal death penalty abolitionist. Givens had kept his work a secret from his own family, hoping to protect them from the horror of what he was tasked with doing. He later told his story to audiences across the country. Some of his final speeches were delivered in Terre Haute, Indiana, home of the federal execution chamber, where he warned of the impact Donald Trump’s planned execution spree would have on prison employees. “People think you can do something like that and then go home and forget about it,” he <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/04/26/jerry-givens-virginia-death-penalty-coronavirus/" target="_blank">said</a> in the fall of 2019. “No. It’s something that is stuck with you.”</p>
<p>Givens did not live to see his home state abolish the death penalty: He <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/04/26/jerry-givens-virginia-death-penalty-coronavirus/" target="_blank">died</a> in April 2020 of Covid-19. But his influence was clear during the debate among lawmakers. Speaking on the floor of the state Senate in early February, Sen. Jennifer McClellan <a href="https://bluevirginia.us/2021/02/video-after-passionate-debate-state-senate-votes-21-17-to-abolish-virginias-death-penalty" target="_blank">recalled</a> hearing him testify in opposition to expanding the death penalty over the years. “I have heard the words of Jerry Givens over and over and over again in my mind,” she said. She remembered how haunted he had been by the case of Earl Washington, the man who falsely confessed and was later exonerated. “He realized the toll it would have taken on him had he executed an innocent man.”</p>
<p>Givens’s family was elated at the news that Virginia had finally abolished the death penalty. “I can recall the moment we found out the law was passed,” Valerie Travers, Givens’s niece, said in a phone call after the signing ceremony. “I think he would have been very happy to see that his work has finally paid off.” It was especially meaningful for Givens’s widow, Sadie. “I was rejoicing for him because I know what he put into it,” she said. For years, she had seen him “thinking, meditating, praying” over the issue. “I know deep within my soul that he visualized this happening. &#8230; He would always say ‘Things are gonna happen. This is gonna happen.’ &#8230; If there’s such thing as looking down, he’s rejoicing because he said it would.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Less than four</u> hours before Corey Johnson was scheduled to die — the second of three people killed in the federal death chamber the week before President Donald Trump left office — the Rev. Bill Breeden sat at a picnic table a few miles from the penitentiary mulling his last words. As Johnson’s minister of record, Breeden had agreed to read a final statement on his behalf. “I took notes on what he wants to say and kind of put it together,” he told me. Anyone who had corresponded with Johnson knew that his writing skills were limited. “He’s childlike in a lot of ways,” Breeden said. “But he’s extremely brilliant in a lot of ways.”</p>
<p>Breeden had left the penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, just a little while earlier. It was his final visit with Johnson, and his eyes were red. Their time together had been brief but intense: five visits over a couple of weeks. Johnson was recovering from Covid-19, which left him fatigued. Breeden marveled at Johnson’s spirit, which had withstood 29 years in solitary confinement without a visitor apart from his attorneys. “He’s a beautiful person,” Breeden said, adding, “He’s very remorseful about his crimes.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>Johnson, 52, was sentenced to death in 1993, when he was in his early 20s. Tried as a “drug kingpin” alongside two other men under the 1988 Anti-Drug Abuse Act, he was convicted of seven murders — a shocking body count that many would associate with the “worst of the worst.” Yet the case would not likely end in a death sentence today. There was significant proof that Johnson had an intellectual disability, which should have <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/federal-government-prepares-to-execute-corey-johnson-who-is-likely-intellectually-disabled-without-any-judicial-review-of-his-eligibility-for-the-death-penalty" target="_blank">forbidden</a> him from being sentenced to death. But reviewing courts refused to consider the evidence.</p>
<p>Regardless, Breeden’s task was not to judge Johnson for his crimes. As Johnson’s spiritual adviser, his job was to prepare him to die. “I don’t care who you are or what you’ve done,” he said. “I think when you’re dying, life should give you the gift of being in the presence of somebody who cares, instead of just people who are paid to kill you.” Breeden knew that many on death row had little sense of self-worth. He shared with Johnson the tale of “The Velveteen Rabbit,” about a boy and his beloved stuffed animal, which eventually comes to life. “You become real by being loved,” Breeden said. Although Johnson’s family had never come to see him on death row, they were in Terre Haute now. Several planned to witness his execution.</p>

<p>A Unitarian minister with a history of civil disobedience, Breeden is well-known among a certain generation of social justice activists in Southern Indiana. He and his wife, Glenda, live on 42 rural acres just outside Spencer, a small town 15 miles from Bloomington. A lifelong pacifist, Breeden’s biggest <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1991/12/01/america-at-a-crossroads/b3b5518f-9857-4cbc-a5b2-f56f92187602/" target="_blank">claim to fame</a> is being the only person imprisoned as a result of the Iran-Contra scandal. After a street in his hometown of Odon was renamed for Adm. John Poindexter, President Ronald Reagan’s national security adviser, Breeden stole the sign and held it for a ransom of $30 million — the sum transferred to the Contras in Nicaragua. He spent four days in jail.</p>
<p>The Breedens were a regular presence at the protests against the Trump administration’s executions. They were among a small handful of activists who had also protested the last round of federal executions 17 years earlier, beginning with Timothy McVeigh in 2001. In the intervening years, Bill Breeden had forged a close relationship with another man on federal death row. When we first spoke last summer, Breeden was worried that the man, who also has an intellectual disability, might be on the verge of an execution date.</p>

<p>Although Breeden has generally found the employees who work in the Special Confinement Unit to be decent people, there have been exceptions. Breeden often tells a story that captures how cruel such individuals can be. It was an open secret that his friend on death row had raised mice for years — one way to forge connections with living creatures while living in crushing isolation. He named the mice and trained them. But one year, a new unit manager came in and ordered an unexpected shakedown. The mice were discovered. When Breeden’s friend begged the guards not to harm the mice, the unit manager mocked him. “And he said, ‘I can’t give them back to you, I just flushed them down the stool,’” Breeden said. His friend tried to kill himself shortly afterward.</p>
<p>There were smaller indignities too, right up until a person’s execution date. Johnson had requested jelly-filled donuts as part of his last meal, Breeden told me, but was given donut holes instead. “I said, ‘That ain’t right. They tell you you can have anything you want, but you can’t get jelly-filled donuts?’” He said he planned to incorporate this into Johnson’s final statement. Perhaps it would add a moment of levity.</p>
<p>But the moment never came. The next time I saw Breeden, it was just after midnight, and he was walking unsteadily in the dark toward the activists gathered at the Dollar General across from the penitentiary. Raw anguish was written on his face. Johnson had been pronounced dead at 11:34 p.m. “I’ve just witnessed the most unimaginable, cold-blooded, premeditated murder,” Breeden said. “I can’t imagine anything worse.”</p>

<p>Inside the execution chamber, a Bureau of Prisons official had read the death warrant with the exaggerated flair of a circus announcer. There was cheering and applause from one of the witness rooms when Johnson was declared dead, presumably from relatives of Johnson’s victims. “I don’t think they would have laughed and clapped if they had let me read Corey’s last statement,” Breeden said. But officials wouldn’t allow it. “They said he has to read it. How’s he gonna read it when he’s lying like this?” he said, stretching out his arms.</p>
<p>Breeden asked for a flashlight and read the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NLzoBe95y1dxITfqdnw6cpEcJM1R1CSo/view" target="_blank">statement</a> he had crafted with Johnson. “I want to say that I am sorry for my crimes,” he began. He listed all seven of Johnson’s victims. “I want these names to be remembered,” he said, telling their families, “I hope you will find peace.”</p>
<p>“To my family, I have always loved you,” Breeden continued. “And your love has made me real. &#8230; I am not the same man that I was.” He thanked the prison staff for their kindness and for giving him pizza and a strawberry shake. “But I didn’t get my jelly-filled donuts that I ordered. What’s with that? This should be fixed.”</p>

<h3>Dismantle the Death Chamber</h3>
<p>Amid the coronavirus pandemic, presidential election, and right-wing insurrection, Trump’s execution spree ended much like it <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/08/02/federal-executions-indiana-trump-coronavirus/" target="_blank">began</a>, with three killings carried out back-to-back over the course of one week. In all, 13 people died in the federal death chamber between July 2020 and January 2021. If not for the abrupt departure of Attorney General William Barr and a major Covid-19 <a href="https://apnews.com/article/public-health-prisons-health-coronavirus-pandemic-executions-956da680790108d8b7e2d8f1567f3803" target="_blank">outbreak</a> on federal death row in December, the number may well have been even higher.</p>
<p>Although it took some time for Americans to start paying attention, the killings revitalized the <a href="http://deathpenaltyaction.org/federal-death-penalty" target="_blank">fight</a> against the death penalty in the United States. Many of the executions were emblematic of capital punishment’s enduring unfairness, and the final three were no exception. Lisa Montgomery, the <a href="https://indianapublicmedia.org/news/a-mothers-justice-the-trials-of-lisa-montgomery-premieres-on-wtiu.php" target="_blank">only woman</a> under a federal death sentence, had lived a life marked by extreme trauma and mental illness. Johnson was killed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/11/opinion/death-penalty-mental-disability.html" target="_blank">despite</a> a Supreme Court ban on executing people with intellectual disabilities. And Dustin Higgs, the last man to die, was executed for three murders carried out by another man, who had <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/01/14/dustin-higgs-federal-executions-death-penalty/" target="_blank">since said</a> that the government’s case was “bullshit.” All of the last six men killed were Black.</p>

<p>On January 21, the day after Joe Biden’s inauguration, I joined a Zoom <a href="http://blogs.law.columbia.edu/abolition1313/8-13-death-penalty-abolition/" target="_blank">panel</a> sponsored by Columbia University titled “Abolish the Federal Death Penalty!” The introduction was upbeat. “This is the first time in American history … that a president of the United States has declared himself to be an abolitionist,” said the moderator, law professor Bernard Harcourt, who has handled capital cases for years.</p>
<p>One of the featured speakers was Rep. Adriano Espaillat, D-N.Y., who has helped lead the charge to abolish the federal death penalty. The calls from activists and lawmakers go <a href="https://bush.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/bush.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/Bush%20Pressley_Death%20Row%20Commutations_Biden%20Letter_012021final%20%2B%20signatories%20final.pdf" target="_blank">well beyond</a> asking Biden to issue a moratorium, which would leave people on federal death row vulnerable to execution in the future. In a <a href="https://pressley.house.gov/media/press-releases/pressley-espaillat-colleagues-urge-ag-nominee-merrick-garland-stop-all" target="_blank">letter</a> written on behalf of 45 members of Congress last month, Espaillat and Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., urged Attorney General nominee Merrick Garland to stop seeking new death sentences and “direct the Bureau of Prisons to dismantle the federal death chamber” in Terre Haute.</p>
<p>Much of the panel focused on an aspect of executions that is often ignored: the impact on the families of the condemned. Author and activist <a href="https://www.susannahsheffer.com" target="_blank">Susannah Sheffer</a> explained it in terms of a concept known as disenfranchised grief: “when a loss cannot be openly acknowledged, publicly mourned, or socially supported.” She was joined by <a href="http://av.lib.utexas.edu/index.php?title=Category:Greenwood,_Lee" target="_blank">Lee Greenwood</a>, whose son was executed in Texas in 2007. His death continued to reverberate, Greenwood said, but she was also fortunate compared to others in her position. One woman she knew had been shunned in her small town after her loved one was sent to death row. Greenwood was grateful that her own friends stood by her. “I don’t know what to say, just know that I’m here,” she recalled some of them telling her.</p>
<p>As the panelists spoke, Alexa Cave Wingate was watching the event on her phone at a shopping mall in Georgia, where she was buying birthday gifts for her granddaughters. It had been less than a week since she’d witnessed the execution of her brother, Higgs. Media witnesses had described loud sobbing coming through the walls that night; the sounds had come from her. Now Wingate was trying to move forward, but the Bureau of Prisons had not even sent her brother’s body for burial. Unable to get through to anyone from the federal government, she took to <a href="https://twitter.com/Cavewoman2769/status/1352424177328926721" target="_blank">Twitter</a> to pressure the BOP. “We’re having a hard time,” she told me in a text message later that night. “But we’ll get it together.”</p>
<p>The following week, <a href="http://deathpenaltyaction.org" target="_blank">Death Penalty Action</a> held another Zoom call, this one featuring Pressley. Since the controversial execution of <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/12/05/federal-executions-brandon-bernard/" target="_blank">Brandon Bernard</a> in December, Pressley said, support for her abolition bill, which she first <a href="https://pressley.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-pressley-introduces-legislation-ban-death-penalty" target="_blank">introduced</a> in 2019, had skyrocketed. Between the House and Senate versions, the number of co-sponsors had climbed from 20 to 80, she said. “And it continues to grow.”</p>

<p>The call also featured Lisa Brown, whose son <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/09/20/federal-executions-christopher-vialva/" target="_blank">Christopher Vialva</a> was Bernard’s co-defendant — and the seventh person killed in the execution spree. Since <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/10/17/trump-execution-christopher-vialva/" target="_blank">witnessing</a> his execution last September, Brown had devoted herself to helping other families navigate the process. In a recent phone call, Brown told me that Johnson’s family had yet to receive his remains. They feared they had been lost in transit — and like Wingate, they could not get any answers from the BOP. “It has just been horrific to talk to the families about the things that they’ve endured after the fact,” Brown told attendees of the meeting.</p>
<p>In response to questions about the handling of Johnson’s and Higgs’s remains, a BOP spokesperson said he was “unable to address specific inmate cases” but referred me to a <a href="https://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/6031_004.pdf" target="_blank">document</a> containing policy information on the bureau’s handling of people who die in its custody. It was titled “Patient Care.”</p>
<p>Brown told me she was especially distraught over Johnson’s execution. She had corresponded with him in the month leading up to his execution, and it was immediately clear from his limited writing skills that what his lawyers said about his intellectual disability was true. She was angered when she heard about the cheering audible from the witness room the night that he died. Before she set foot in the room where she would watch the government kill her own son, she said, “I was specifically instructed … that if we banged on that witness room window, if we said anything too loud, if we got too loud even with our crying, that we would be removed.”</p>

<h3>Just Look at Me</h3>
<p>Of the final three people scheduled to die, many believed Lisa Montgomery had the best shot at clemency. Although her crimes were horrific — the murder of a pregnant woman and the abduction of the woman’s unborn child — it was clear to most, including others on federal death row, that they were driven by trauma and mental illness. “Everyone I’ve talked to about Lisa, including the staff, all concluded that Lisa was ‘crazy,’” one condemned man wrote to me after her execution.</p>
<p>Since the Bureau of Prisons first notified Montgomery in October that she’d been given a date to die, her fragile mental state had dramatically worsened. At the medical prison where she was incarcerated in Texas, she was stripped of all her belongings, including photos of her children, and placed in a small cell that was brightly lit around the clock. The conditions, designed to prevent suicide, were described as torture in a <a href="http://American Civil Liberties Union" target="_blank">lawsuit</a> brought by the American Civil Liberties Union. Montgomery, a survivor of extreme sexual violence, was not allowed to wear her normal undergarments, and she had no privacy when using the bathroom. It was only due to pressure from her attorneys that Montgomery was allowed a pair of socks, a crayon, and a single piece of paper at a time.</p>
<p>Montgomery’s attorneys arrived in Terre Haute on the Saturday before her scheduled execution on January 12. They were not notified in advance of when she would be transported from Texas to Indiana, but they knew it would be close to her execution date. Days earlier, her attorney Kelley Henry had presented Montgomery’s clemency petition to pardon attorneys at the Department of Justice in a video call while watching footage of the insurrection at the Capitol.</p>
<p>On the morning of her execution, Montgomery met with her spiritual adviser, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lisa-montgomery-final-hours-lawyer-execution_n_5ffe02aec5b66f3f7961e909" target="_blank">who told her</a> that he would be in the execution chamber with her and would sing “Amazing Grace” and “Jesus Loves Me” when the lethal injection drugs started to flow. But when he arrived that night, he was not allowed in the room. As the execution began, one media witness <a href="https://twitter.com/mtarm/status/1349246454464995333" target="_blank">wrote</a>, an executioner removed Montgomery’s face mask and asked if she had any last words. “‘No,’ Montgomery responded in a quiet, muffled voice. She said nothing else.” She was pronounced dead at 1:31 a.m.</p>

<p>At the Dollar General across from the penitentiary, a group of people stood quietly apart from the activists who held vigils on execution nights. The group had asked for privacy. When <a href="http://www.federaldeathinmates.com/viewblogpost/2003" target="_blank">they saw the vans</a> carrying media witnesses pass by, they formed a circle and held hands. Later I would discover that they were members of Montgomery’s family. “We were praying for the stays to stick,” one of her daughters wrote in a message as the family left Terre Haute. “Probably the most heartbreaking news was to find out we lost everything.”</p>
<p>Wingate arrived in Terre Haute on the evening of Montgomery’s execution. The next morning, she visited her brother in person for the first time in 20 years. Although their visit took place behind glass, she could see Higgs was struggling with Covid-19 symptoms. “He still was having a hard time breathing, and he said his head hurt,” she said.</p>
<p>For a time, she had been hopeful that the virus would end up saving his life. After both Higgs and Johnson contracted Covid-19 in December, a district judge temporarily blocked the executions to allow them to recover. But Higgs warned her not to get her hopes up. It would ultimately come down to the Supreme Court. “He said, ‘Watch what they do with Corey, and then you’ll know,’” Wingate said.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[9](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A1%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="1"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[9] -->
<p>By 10 p.m. on January 14, the courts had ruled against Johnson. “That’s when it really hit me that I’m going to lose my brother tomorrow,” Wingate said. In a phone call that night, Higgs admitted that he was scared. “I want you to always look at me. Just look at me. Don’t look at nobody else,” Wingate told her brother. “I’m going to be right there for you.”</p>
<p>The next morning, Wingate woke up with a sense of peace. Her brother’s fate was in God’s hands. For all the fear and anguish of the past few weeks, there had been moments of joy as well. She’d gotten married on January 2, and Higgs called her on her wedding day. “My brother was extremely happy for me,” she said. He trusted her new husband to take care of her. “He said to me, ‘I don’t have to worry about you no more.’”</p>
<p>Just before 4 p.m., Wingate walked from her car toward a white van in the parking lot of the Vigo County Sheriff’s Department. A wet snow was falling hard and fast. Two Bureau of Prisons employees in blue protective gear escorted her into the vehicle, where Higgs’s spiritual adviser, Yusuf Ahmed Nur, an imam and professor at Indiana University Kokomo, was waiting. The van drove them to the penitentiary, and they were placed in a classroom, where they would wait into the night. Nur read a book while Wingate played solitaire. They were given chips and cookies but no dinner. Just before 11 p.m., the Supreme Court lifted the last barriers standing in the way of Higgs’s execution. Shortly afterward, it was time to go.</p>
<p>“I don’t think that it became real until the curtain went up,” Wingate said. Her brother was lying on the gurney, covered with a sheet. There were speakers that fed the sound into the witness room, but Wingate did not realize they only went one way. “I thought he could hear me so, I kept saying, ‘Look at me, look at me.’ I was motioning with my hands.” Higgs proclaimed his innocence, as he had all along. “Tell my family I love them,” he said. “Stay strong.” He was looking at his sister. “He looked at me the whole time until the very end,” she said.</p>

<h3>Disenfranchised Grief</h3>
<p>On the Sunday after the executions ended, Breeden welcomed two guests to his Unitarian church in Bloomington for a Martin Luther King Jr. Day service, which was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/uubloomington/videos/1801115623402864" target="_blank">streamed</a> over Facebook. To Breeden’s left was Sister Barbara Battista, a Catholic nun from St. Mary-of-the-Woods in Terre Haute. To his right was Nur. They now belonged to “a rather unwanted club,” Breeden said. Between the three of them, they had accompanied five of the 13 people executed by the Trump administration.</p>
<p>Nur was the first to speak. He had contracted Covid-19 in November while serving as the spiritual adviser to Orlando Hall, the eighth man to die. Despite a subsequent <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/under-court-order-requiring-protective-measures-federal-bureau-of-prisons-takes-no-action-after-media-witnesses-to-executions-contract-covid-19" target="_blank">court order</a> instructing the Bureau of Prisons to abide by stricter Covid-19 protocols, media witnesses said members of the execution team did not wear masks during the execution of Corey Johnson. Shortly after the church service in Bloomington, two media witnesses would <a href="https://indianapublicmedia.org/news/u.s.-leaves-journalists-in-the-dark-after-our-reporters-test-positive-for-covid-19.php" target="_blank">test positive</a> for Covid-19.</p>
<p>Nur spoke haltingly, taking long pauses as he described Higgs’s execution that Friday. In the classroom where he and Wingate waited to hear from the Supreme Court, he had found a copy of the novella “Heart of Darkness” by Joseph Conrad. “I reread it slowly,” he said, absorbing the text in a way he never had before. The book was about the horrors visited upon the Congolese by King Leopold II of Belgium, he said, horrors committed by “people who described themselves as enlightened and civilized.”</p>

<p>“The government would like you to believe that [an execution is] a painless death,” Nur said. “It’s not. And it takes a lot out of us who witness. … You see a fellow human being killed right in front of you. And you can’t do anything about it.”</p>
<p>A few days later, Biden was inaugurated, and the Covid-19 lockdown over the Special Confinement Unit was lifted. “I must admit, these last 7 months have been very stressful to me and others,” one man on death row wrote in an email. The execution dates tended to come at the end of the week, late in the afternoon. “Every Friday, I was just like everyone here, praying and hoping they didn’t come to my cell, saying the Warden wanted to talk with me. … Last week was the first time since July everyone … wasn’t watching the clock around 5:30. You could feel the stress leave this place once Biden was sworn in.”</p>
<p>Another condemned man, who works as an orderly, went to clean the death range where his neighbors had spent their last days. “Upon entering each of the cells, intimate memories of each of them fluttered in my consciousness,” he wrote. When he entered the cell where Higgs was held, “I was surprised to see that he had spent some of his last days painting: there was pieces of used masking tape, with acrylic paint on them, on the outside corner of his shower; plus, paint splatter was on the floor and sink.”</p>
<p>Higgs had become an artist during his final years on death row. In an email before he was killed, he told me he’d taught himself to draw and paint as part of a larger effort at self-improvement. “I have worked relentlessly for over two decades to transform my mind by changing the way I think,” he wrote. He was formulating a plan for a business and charity and would leave instructions for his family to see it through. “I truly believe I will bring them out of poverty,” he said. “That will be my legacy.”</p>
<p>On Friday, January 29, Wingate <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-executions-funeral/at-the-funeral-of-man-executed-by-u-s-family-prays-it-is-the-last-of-its-kind-idUSKBN29Z04B?edition-redirect=in" target="_blank">buried</a> her brother in their hometown of Poughkeepsie, New York, in the cemetery where his mother is also buried. She wore a black top printed with the word “faith.” “I know that’s what’s going to help me get through this,” she said.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/LilianaSegura/status/1350335538583240705" target="_blank">statement</a> the night of the execution, the sister of one of the victims had acknowledged the loss for Higgs’s family. “They are now going to go through the pain we experienced,” she wrote. For Wingate, the grief comes in waves, as is often the case with mourning. But “it’s hard to explain how you feel to people because this is not a normal grief,” Wingate said. At the Indianapolis airport the day after her brother’s execution, she sat in front of the observation deck. “I was sitting there watching the planes, and then next thing you know, I’m just boohooing and crying,” Wingate said. “It just came out of nowhere.” A woman came over and asked, “‘Ma’am, are you OK?’ I was like, ‘Yeah, I’m fine, I’m fine.’”</p>
<p>Wingate is impatient for Biden to end the federal death penalty. “I thought that would be one of the first things he did,” she said. While she has vowed to take a break from the news and social media, she is refusing to be invisible. At a Dunkin’ Donuts in Poughkeepsie, a man saw her wearing her Abolish the Death Penalty mask and challenged her. “‘Why?&#8217; he asked. ‘Why abolish the death penalty?’ I said, ‘So nobody else has to go through what my family went through.’ He stopped talking. He kept moving. He walked away.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>On the night</u> Lisa Montgomery was executed by the Trump administration, Alexa Cave Wingate arrived at the Springhill Suites in Terre Haute, Indiana, at 9 p.m. The hotel sits at the intersection of U.S. Highway 41 and Interstate 70. The interstate leads all the way to Baltimore, where Wingate’s brother, Dustin Higgs, had been sentenced to die more than 20 years earlier.</p>
<p>Some 3 miles in the opposite direction, in a brick building on the banks of the Wabash River, is the federal death chamber. Montgomery, the only woman under a federal death sentence, was being held in a small room adjacent to it. The execution chamber was constructed just after the passage of the 1994 crime bill, but the surrounding penitentiary predates even the interstate. When the prison first opened more than 75 years ago, the meeting of Highway 41 and Old State Road 40 made Terre Haute the “Crossroads of America” — a convenient location to bring people in federal custody from all over the country.</p>
<p>Higgs arrived on federal death row in January 2001, just five months before the execution of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. After the Trump administration restarted executions last summer following a 17-year pause, Higgs saw 10 of his neighbors taken to their deaths. On November 20, the day after his friend <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/11/18/death-penalty-execution-orlando-hall/" target="_blank">Orlando Hall</a> died by lethal injection, Higgs got an execution date himself. On Friday, after the scheduled execution of Corey Johnson on January 14, Higgs is set to be the last person to die in Trump’s killing spree. Wingate plans to be a witness.</p>

<p>“Dustin is actually technically my first cousin,” Wingate explained when we first spoke in December. But they grew up largely in the same household in Poughkeepsie, New York, and refer to each other as brother and sister. “When Dustin first came home from the hospital, I was there,” Wingate said.</p>
<p>After giving birth to her own daughter in 1990, Wingate enlisted in the Army, the best of a limited set of options. “I had to find a way to take care of her, to get a skill, and my family didn’t have money for me to go to college.” Following a year stationed in South Korea, she moved to Washington, D.C. — and Higgs followed. By then, Wingate was raising two kids while going to night school at the University of the District of Columbia. “He helped me so much,” Wingate recalled.</p>

<p>For a time, their plans for the future were intertwined. Higgs wanted to open a barbershop and Wingate wanted to be a funeral director. “I said, ‘OK, well, you can come and we can start this family business. You can fix the hair. I’ll do the makeup and I’ll do the embalming and all that,’” Wingate said. “That was our original goal.” But eventually Higgs started to pull away from her.</p>
<p>Wingate had moved back to New York when she got a phone call in 1996 saying that Higgs had been arrested for dealing drugs. “I was like, ‘How did you keep that from me?’ He said because he knew I wouldn’t approve, so he never brought it around me at all.” But a worse nightmare unfolded in 1998, when Higgs was charged as a suspect in a horrific triple murder. The victims, Mishann Chinn, 23, Tanji Jackson, 21, and Tamika Black, 19, had been found fatally shot around 4 a.m. on January 27, 1996, on a road that cut through the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, a federal tract of land in Prince George’s County, between D.C. and Baltimore. All three worked in local schools and did not fit investigators’ profile of women whose lives might “invite violence,” according to a true crime <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/we-leave-you-our-deaths/id1532894981?i=1000504489472" target="_blank">podcast</a> that recently explored the case.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[2](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[2] -->“I remember him saying, ‘You know I didn’t.’ And I said, ‘You don’t even have to finish that sentence.

<p>Investigators found a day planner in Jackson’s purse that contained Higgs’s address and license plate number. After Higgs initially denied any involvement to police, a pair of his associates, Victor Gloria and Willis Haynes, were arrested together on federal drug charges, prompting what an investigator would later describe as an “incredible confession” from Gloria. Agreeing to be a witness for the government in exchange for a lesser sentence, Gloria testified that the three men had been hanging out with Chinn, Jackson, and Black in Higgs’s apartment when Jackson rejected Higgs. The two argued and she took down his information. Higgs became angry, telling Gloria and Haynes that Jackson “knew some people” who could hurt him. After offering the women a ride back toward D.C., according to Gloria, Higgs instead drove the group in his van to the federal reserve, where he gave Haynes a handgun and said, “Make sure they’re all dead.”</p>
<p>Wingate was skeptical from the start. She had never known Higgs to be violent toward women. When Higgs called her after the charges were filed, “I remember him saying, ‘You know I didn’t.’ And I said, ‘You don’t even have to finish that sentence. I know you didn’t.’”</p>
<p>And there were reasons to doubt Gloria’s credibility. In his earliest statements to police, he said that he’d been passed out in the backseat of Higgs’s van and woke up to gunshots. But later, he said he saw 23-year-old Higgs give 18-year-old Haynes the gun and threaten him if he did not shoot the women. At Haynes’s trial in August 2000, which ended in a life sentence, the government argued that he had not been intimidated by Higgs into shooting the women. Shortly afterward, at Higgs’s trial, the same prosecutors cast Higgs as the dominant player who had coerced Haynes into doing his bidding. On October 11, 2000, jurors convicted Higgs.</p>

<p>Later that month, Wingate drove down to Baltimore with the aunt who had raised them both as kids. “His lawyers asked us to testify at his sentencing hearing, to make them know what we know about Dustin, that he’s not this monster that the prosecution said he is,” she recalled. There was plenty to say. Higgs’s mother had died of cancer when he was a child, and the whole family saw how, in the absence of his father, he strived to take care of her in her final days. But Wingate felt unprepared. It was the first time she had seen Higgs in person in four years. “I’m trying to answer the questions that they’re asking me,” she said, but “I’m just crying.”</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors urged jurors to sentence Higgs to death. “The hard truth is, ladies and gentlemen, it would be a better world in the future without Dustin Higgs,” one <a href="https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F3/353/353.F3d.281.01-3.html" target="_blank">told</a> the jury. The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2000/10/27/md-man-sentenced-to-die-for-ordering-96-triple-slayings/1d82d3e7-d83a-460a-92d8-fa05adf8c04a/" target="_blank">described</a> how Assistant U.S. Attorney Sandra Wilkinson “displayed a large rock and likened it to the emotional weight borne by relatives of the victims, a burden she said would be lightened if Higgs were to be put to death.”</p>
<p>Wingate was not in the courtroom for the sentencing. Her aunt worked as a nurse and the two had driven back to New York in time for her shift. Wingate was home crocheting a blanket for Higgs when one of her cousins called. “She said, ‘Hey, Lex, you OK?’ I said, ‘Yeah, I’m fine.’ … She said, ‘Oh. So you didn’t hear.’” Her cousin told her that Higgs had been sentenced to death. “I just screamed,” Wingate said. Her kids, then ages 8 and 10, came to ask what was wrong. She tried her best to explain.</p>
<p>For the past 20 years, Wingate has regularly spoken to Higgs on the phone. These days, he calls her every day. But she had never visited Higgs in Terre Haute. “I can’t afford it,” she said. With the help of one of Higgs’s <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/federal-death-penalty/" target="_blank">friends on death row</a>, Wingate raised enough money to visit her brother for the first time. She wants to be present for his execution. “When my brother came home from the hospital, I was the first face he saw when he opened his eyes when my aunt laid him on the couch,” she said. “So I want to be the last face he sees before he leaves.”</p>

<h3>The Wrong Place at the Wrong Time</h3>
<p>To the activists who have gathered in Terre Haute since last summer, the late-night execution of Lisa Montgomery was a blow, but not a surprise. Many had high hopes that <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/12/05/federal-executions-brandon-bernard/" target="_blank">Brandon Bernard</a> would be saved in December, only to see his appeals dismissed by the courts and calls for clemency ignored by the president. After 11 executions waved through by the U.S. Supreme Court, few are optimistic that Johnson or Higgs will be spared.</p>
<p>Yet, like Montgomery, both men have legal claims that have never been fully adjudicated. Johnson has an intellectual disability that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/11/opinion/death-penalty-mental-disability.html" target="_blank">should</a> make him ineligible for execution — and Higgs has <a href="https://www.fd.org/news/dustin-higgs-execution-roadblock-govt-appeal-be-heard-twelve-days-after-scheduled-execution" target="_blank">convinced</a> a federal court to schedule an oral argument on whether his execution would violate federal law based in part on the fact that he was convicted in Maryland, which abolished the death penalty in 2013. That argument is set for January 27 — 12 days after Higgs is supposed to die. But such things have not stood in the way of the federal executions.</p>
<p>Like more than half of the men on federal death row, both Johnson and Higgs contracted Covid-19 last month. Attorneys <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/men-death-row-covid-19-increase-suffering-execution_n_5ff5cbc4c5b6ea7351c70339" target="_blank">argued</a> that lung damage from the illness would make them vulnerable to an especially tortuous death by lethal injection, which has been shown to cause pulmonary edema. On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan agreed, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1msGIxH23FSWu9DzOTO0IiAH1SdstRJZ2/view" target="_blank">delaying</a> the executions on the grounds that killing the men now would violate the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Johnson’s family was ecstatic over the news, according to his spiritual adviser, who had to explain to them that this would not necessarily stop the execution. Wingate was hopeful too. But in a phone call after she landed in Indiana, her brother warned her not to assume the ruling would hold.</p>

<p>To Higgs, the issues raised in the current litigation pale in comparison to what he has insisted upon for years: that he is innocent of the crime that sent him to death row. On a <a href="http://www.savedustinjhiggs.com" target="_blank">website</a> created by his advocates, Higgs argues that not only did Willis Haynes pull the trigger that killed Chinn, Jackson, and Black, but Higgs also never ordered such a thing to begin with.</p>
<p>His claims are backed up by an affidavit written by Haynes in 2012, which was included in a clemency application for Higgs during the Obama administration. “The prosecution’s theory of our case was bullshit,” Haynes wrote. “Dustin didn’t threaten me. I was not scared of him. Dustin didn’t make me do anything that night or ever.” Higgs also argues that his defense attorneys failed to investigate critical witnesses — and that federal prosecutors hid evidence from his attorneys at trial.</p>
<p>Especially consequential was evidence that the government’s star witness, Gloria, was a suspect in a separate murder case in Baltimore, but the FBI did not pursue him in order to gain his help in the case against Higgs. In a 2014 affidavit, Higgs’s trial attorney Henry Trainor wrote that the information about Gloria would have altered the case significantly. “I consider receiving a free pass on a murder charge to be an extraordinary benefit for a witness,” he said. Had defense attorneys been aware of this deal, he added, they certainly would have used it to challenge Gloria’s credibility.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon to see evidence like this revealed after a person has been sentenced to death. Yet such red flags are often not enough to stop an execution. Even if Higgs did not direct Haynes to shoot Chinn, Jackson, and Black, he still would have been eligible for the death penalty under a felony murder prosecution. In some ways, his case is emblematic of the death penalty as a punishment reserved not for the “worst of the worst,” but for those who find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time — in this case, facing federal murder charges in the District of Maryland in the wake of the 1994 crime bill.</p>

<p>The killing of Chinn, Jackson, and Black came at a time when the Department of Justice had been preparing to ramp up executions. Less than a year before the murders, in July 1995, the Baltimore Sun reported that federal prosecutors were on the lookout for cases that might warrant the death penalty. “It could be a gang lord or a murderous carjacker or a drug smuggler,” the Sun reported. “But sometime in the coming months, U.S. Attorney Lynne A. Battaglia expects to take the unprecedented step of seeking the death penalty against someone for committing a federal crime in Maryland.”</p>
<p>The Sun cited a number of downsides. For one, each federal death penalty case was estimated to cost $340,000 “in public defender fees alone.” What’s more, contrary to popular assumption, police seemed skeptical of the need for executions to maintain law and order. “In a recent poll of the nation’s police chiefs, the death penalty ranked last among methods they felt were effective in reducing street crime.”</p>
<p>Finally, there was the age-old problem of racism. A 1994 congressional study <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/facts-and-research/dpic-reports/in-depth/racial-disparities-in-federal-death-penalty-prosecutions-1988-1994" target="_blank">found</a> that 89 percent of the cases in which federal prosecutors chose to seek the death penalty under the 1988 Anti-Drug Abuse Act involved Black or Latino defendants. Nevertheless, Battaglia told the Sun that the public was demanding death penalty prosecutions. “I hope we never have to consider it,” she said. “But there are circumstances where you have to take people out of society.”</p>
<p>Veteran private investigator Sharon Weidenfeld had been working on murder cases in Prince George’s County for years when she was hired to work on Higgs’s defense. Although her recollections are sketchy, she remembered conducting a key interview with Gloria’s ex-girlfriend, Katrina Havenner, in September 2000. Havenner told Weidenfeld that despite Gloria’s new statements to police, he told her that he’d been asleep when Haynes shot the three women. She repeated the statement in a 2006 affidavit, explaining that Gloria could never hold his liquor and would pass out after drinking. According to Havenner, Gloria also told her that Haynes had threatened to kill her and their daughter if he said anything. “Victor believed Willis and so did I,” she said.</p>
<p>Havenner’s claims were corroborated by Gloria himself in a 2004 interview conducted by an investigator working with Higgs’s legal team at the Federal Community Defender Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Gloria complained that he’d been incarcerated “for nothing,” since he was asleep when the women were shot, the investigator wrote in an affidavit. “When I then asked Mr. Gloria whether that meant that his statements and testimony concerning the events that occurred at the crime scene were not true,” the investigator continued, “Mr. Gloria replied, ‘That was the police.’”</p>

<p>“It happens a lot, where people will give statements to the police and tell them one thing and then when I interview them, they’ll tell me something else,” Weidenfeld told me. “And a lot of the times, it turns out that what they’re telling me is really the truth.” Police, after all, rely upon myriad tactics to get suspects and witnesses to talk, including threats and promises that can provide a powerful incentive to lie.</p>
<p>When Weidenfeld saw the news that Higgs had been given an execution date, she immediately recognized his name. It sickened her that he had been scheduled to die on January 15 — Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday. She finds President Donald Trump’s execution spree especially grotesque when contrasted with his clemency record. Among those he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/12/29/trump-pardons-stephanie-mohr-prince-georges/" target="_blank">pardoned</a> last month is a Prince George’s County police officer who was convicted of violating the civil rights of a Latino immigrant the same year Higgs arrived on death row. The officer, Stephanie Mohr, had a history of using her police dog to threaten and attack people of color. Weidenfeld had seen this racist brutality up close in her decades working in Prince George’s County. In fact, she was <a href="https://dcist.com/story/20/12/24/trump-pardons-prince-georges-officer-stephanie-mohr-dog-police-brutality-case/" target="_blank">instrumental</a> in exposing the abuse.</p>
<p>The lead prosecutor in Higgs’s case, Deborah Johnston, was an assistant state’s attorney in Prince George’s County before she became a federal prosecutor. In a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-md/pr/dedication-ceremony-memory-deborah-johnston" target="_blank">tribute</a> following her death in 2017, the Justice Department highlighted her role in convicting “the sole two death row defendants in the District of Maryland, ensuring that the interests of the United States were fully vindicated.” Weidenfeld had a slightly different description of Johnston. “I never knew her to show any mercy for any criminal defendant, no matter their circumstances,” she said.</p>
<p>Battaglia, the former U.S. attorney, did not respond to emails sent this week. Neither did Wilkinson, who prosecuted Higgs’s case alongside Johnston and still works for the Justice Department. In 2014, she was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-md/pr/attorney-general-recognizes-two-maryland-assistant-us-attorneys" target="_blank">recognized</a> by then-Attorney General Eric Holder for her “superior performance” securing a conviction in a murder-for-hire case that had previously sent the wrong man to prison. “This case resulted in the exoneration of an innocent man and the conviction of the real killer,” U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein said at the time. More recently, Wilkinson was <a href="https://www.seddiqlaw.com/annappareddy-case-dismissed-due-to-false-testimony-and-destruction-of-evidence-by-the-government/" target="_blank">excoriated</a> by a federal judge for presenting false evidence to gain a conviction in a fraud case that was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/05/06/526922555/this-was-a-colossal-screw-up-a-close-look-at-a-case-dismissed-for-misconduct" target="_blank">dismissed</a> due to prosecutorial misconduct. The “promotion of false significant testimony in this case does shock the conscience of this court,” the judge wrote.</p>

<h3>A Prayer for Six Days</h3>
<p>Early Wednesday morning, Wingate went to see Higgs with her son JaCobi. They had to report to the penitentiary by 7:30 a.m. She had not slept much the night before. It was the first time she was going to see her brother since his sentencing trial, and she was anxious and excited.</p>
<p>In their phone calls, Wingate said, Higgs has told her what it is like on the day after an execution. “He’s like, ‘It’s quiet. It’s so quiet.’ Because usually people are watching TV … or they’re talking to each other through the cell.” But after an execution, “nobody’s talking.”</p>
<p>In his emails to me over the past month and a half, Higgs emphasized his innocence and decried the corrupt system that sent him to death row. He shared his dismay over the execution of Bernard, who was a close friend. On the day after Christmas, he offered condolences for the bombing in Nashville, where I live.</p>
<p>More recently, he has described what he wants his legacy to be. For the past 20 years, he has tried “to re-educate myself by reading hundred upon hundreds of books,” he said, and more recently he taught himself to paint. “I have also wrote a children book, and a book comprised of my reflective thoughts.” The goal, he said, is to make a difference, to honor his family, and to “bring them out of poverty.”</p>
<p>He also worries about how his execution will impact Wingate if it goes through. She has been his protector since he was little, he said. “When the boys my age would beat me up, my sister would leap into action and protect her little brother,” he said. “That is one of many reasons that our bond is so strong today. I am 48 years old and my sister is still fighting on my behalf.”</p>
<p>The families of Chinn, Jackson, and Black did not respond to emails sent this week. It is not clear whether they plan to witness Higgs’s execution. “My heart goes out to them,” Wingate said. “I haven’t lost a child. I don’t know what that’s like. … I just want them to understand that it’s not my brother that did it.”</p>
<p>With the Justice Department appealing Chutkan’s ruling, Wingate is trying to focus on making the most of her time with Higgs. She will spend Thursday visiting her brother, possibly for the last time. She admitted to feeling some hope after he tested positive in December. It sounds terrible to say, “I’m glad you got Covid,” she said, “but that’s not what it is. &#8230; It’s just a feeling of maybe this can slow down your execution.” With the inauguration of Joe Biden on January 20, even a short delay would change everything.</p>
<p>“Just give me six days,” Wingate said. “Every night I go to bed and that’s all I pray for. … I don’t care if it’s a stay or a reprieve, whatever. Six days is all I pray for. Six days.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>One week before</u> her client was scheduled to die in the federal execution chamber, capital defense attorney Kelley Henry shared a photograph with reporters assembled on a Zoom call. It showed an old trailer in a grassy field in Osage, Oklahoma. This was the spot where her client Lisa Montgomery was repeatedly raped as a child.</p>
<p>Henry had taken the photograph herself. It was an emblem of Montgomery’s harrowing life story. “We’ve described it as Lisa experiencing life like a horror movie growing up,” Henry said. “But what happened to Lisa was worse than a horror movie. Worse than anything you can imagine.”</p>
<p>Montgomery was convicted in 2007 for murdering a pregnant Kansas woman named Bobbie Jo Stinnett. She strangled her, then cut her open to abduct her unborn baby. Arrested in 2005, Montgomery was tried on federal charges and sentenced to die.</p>
<p>Despite her gruesome actions, there was an outpouring of <a href="https://deathpenaltyworldwide.org/project/savelisa/?fbclid=IwAR36uWEXJQKfEXX5lGjbDiEGGj2s9r-7izmhdSig-dD7tYC6sVF1ySfdtAQ" target="_blank">support</a> for Montgomery after her execution date was announced last fall. Media outlets <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lisa-montgomery-death-penalty-trump-administration_n_5fa586a3c5b623bfac4f101d" target="_blank">detailed</a> her history of mental illness as well as the <a href="https://indianapublicmedia.org/news/topics/a-mothers-justice.php" target="_blank">extreme</a> physical and psychological <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/lisa-montgomery-execution/" target="_blank">abuse</a> she endured growing up, raped by her stepfather and trafficked by her mother. They described the shocking <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/12/lisa-montgomery-federal-execution.html" target="_blank">incompetence</a> of her trial attorneys, who failed her at every turn. Today, more than 40 current and former prosecutors support Montgomery’s clemency petition, including some who have prosecuted women for similar crimes. “We know from first-hand experience that these crimes are inevitably the product of serious mental illness,” two of them wrote. “Women who commit such crimes also are likely to have been victimized themselves.”</p>

<p>Despite all this support, there is good reason to doubt that Montgomery’s life will be spared. Just before the press conference began on January 5, Henry and her colleagues received word that they had lost their latest appeal. Although they have called upon the president to be a “hero” by sparing Montgomery’s life, Donald Trump has thus far shown no compassion for those scheduled to die.</p>

<p>If the Department of Justice gets its way, Montgomery will be killed by lethal injection on January 12. Two days later, Corey Johnson is set to die, followed the next day by Dustin Higgs. Both Johnson and Higgs <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-prisons-coronavirus-pandemic-executions-terre-haute-87c7c706f3168cacf1d591e87544109f" target="_blank">contracted</a> Covid-19 in December — part of a severe outbreak in the Special Confinement Unit at the federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana. As the press conference about Montgomery wrapped up, lawyers for Johnson and Higgs were in an evidentiary hearing with a federal judge <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-executions-coronavirus/u-s-judge-weighs-delaying-executions-of-two-inmates-with-covid-19-idUSKBN29A2NK" target="_blank">arguing</a> that lung damage sustained by their clients heightened the risk that they would suffer a tortuous death.</p>
<p>If the three executions go through, Trump will have executed 13 people in the federal death chamber since July. It’s an astonishing body count, made even more unprecedented by the coronavirus pandemic, which has sickened countless people connected to the executions. The pandemic has put defense attorneys in an especially wretched position. Lawyers have been forced to choose between protecting their health and fulfilling their obligations to their clients. Henry and her co-counsel <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lisa-montgomery-federal-death-row_n_5ff73114c5b61a92a8c0861a" target="_blank">chose</a> the latter last fall, traveling to see Montgomery after her date was announced, only to later test positive for Covid-19. Over protests from government prosecutors, a court granted a brief delay to allow them to recover in order to complete the clemency petition. But a new execution date was promptly set.</p>

<p>With Americans still reeling from the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/01/07/capitol-trump-violence-law-enforcement/">insurrection at the Capitol</a> — and fearful of more violence as Trump’s term comes to an end — the final federal executions are likely absent from most people’s minds. A <a href="https://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/athena/files/2020/12/29/5feb6e45c5b6e1ce833d0ac6.pdf" target="_blank">poll</a> of registered voters found that, while there is significant opposition to the resumption of federal executions after a 17-year pause, 40 percent had heard “nothing at all” about the 10 executions carried out last year. For many of those who have tuned in, the push to <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/01/03/death-penalty-capital-punishment-covid-abolition/">kill so many people during a global pandemic</a> is an emblem of Trumpism, the kind of cruelty and incompetence that has defined his presidency.</p>
<p>But it would be a mistake to write off the killing spree as yet another grim chapter of the Trump era. The federal executions have been possible thanks to a system that long predates Trump. The death machinery in Terre Haute — and the legal infrastructure that sustains it — is a <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/07/29/death-penalty-federal-executions/" target="_blank">bipartisan</a> creation, animated by prosecutors and judges whose power has been derived from Democratic and Republican administrations alike. And while the killing season in Terre Haute may look like an aberration, it is part of a violent tradition that Americans have accepted for years.</p>
<p>With President-elect Joe Biden vowing to end the federal death penalty, the killing spree in Terre Haute will soon be over. But even if federal executions never resume, the death penalty remains active in the rest of the country. Lawyers like Henry, who <a href="https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/cover-story/article/21098273/for-some-death-row-inmates-kelley-henry-is-the-last-line-of-defense" target="_blank">represents</a> people on Tennessee’s death row, will still have to fight for the lives of their clients this year, even if Montgomery is spared. If there is to be an honest reckoning over the excesses of this era, it must start by acknowledging that our worst cruelties did not begin or end with Trump — and that the systems that enabled him remain in place. The question is whether Americans are willing to do anything about it.</p>

<h3>A History of Violence</h3>
<p>In December, ProPublica published a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-trump-and-barrs-last-minute-killing-spree">story</a> that provided a glimpse into Trump’s execution spree from inside the Justice Department. In their rush to kill, it explained, Attorney General William Barr and several enablers “trampled over an array of barriers, both legal and practical.” There were “middle-of-the-night killings,” a man “strapped to the gurney while lawyers worked to remove a court order,” and another who was executed despite a pending appeal.</p>
<p>The story laid out how the administration “bought drugs from a secret pharmacy that failed a quality test” and paid experts with questionable credentials for reports backing the government’s lethal injection protocol. Especially chilling to many, the U.S. Bureau of Prisons solicited private contractors to carry out the executions and paid them in cash.</p>
<p>The picture was certainly galling. It came on the heels of another revelation, that Trump planned to change federal rules to allow for older execution methods like the firing squad and electric chair. Yet for those who have seen how the death penalty operates for years, all of this was actually fairly familiar. In Missouri alone, not only did a man spend <a href="https://news.stlpublicradio.org/other/2005-05-18/inmate-was-strapped-down-for-three-hours-during-execution-delay" target="_blank">three hours</a> on the gurney in 2005 before being killed in the dead of night, but <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/02/missouri-executed-this-man-while-his-appeal-was-pending-in-court/283494/" target="_blank">several</a> people have been executed over the last decade while their appeals were still pending. And for all the revulsion over Trump’s new execution rule, states have been seeking to revive old execution methods for years. In Tennessee, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/us/electric-chair-tennessee.html" target="_blank">five</a> of the last seven executions carried out since 2018 took place in the electric chair.</p>

<p>The maneuvering to find drugs for lethal injection — and the secrecy around it — was especially familiar. For more than a decade, death penalty states have gone to desperate, sometimes illegal lengths to carry out executions by lethal injection. Long before the Trump administration sought out the pentobarbital used to execute people in Terre Haute, states around the country had come to rely on sketchy suppliers. After a series of botched executions in 2010, death penalty lawyers <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/executioners-dilemma/" target="_blank">traced</a> the origins of one of the drugs to a British pharmaceutical wholesaler based in the back of a driving school. In 2015, BuzzFeed News <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/chrismcdaniel/this-is-the-man-in-india-who-is-selling-states-illegally-imp">tracked</a> illegally imported lethal injection drugs to an office building in India. As states turned to largely unregulated compounding pharmacies on U.S. soil, providers of lethal injection drugs were exposed as having alarming track records. The supplier for Texas <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/chrismcdaniel/inmates-said-the-drug-burned-as-they-died-this-is-how-texas" target="_blank">forged</a> quality control documents. In Missouri, prison officials <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/missouri-executed-17-prisoners-with-drugs-secretly-obtained-from-high-risk-pharmacy-cited-for-hazardous-practices" target="_blank">paid</a> for drugs in cash from a pharmacy labeled “high risk” by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the U.S. Supreme Court made it virtually impossible to challenge lethal injection even as states adopted hasty new formulas, swapping out substances with little notion as to whether they would work as intended. In 2015, the justices <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2014/14-7955" target="_blank">upheld</a> a three-drug protocol using midazolam despite warnings from anesthesiologists that the drug, a sedative, did not have the properties needed to render a person insensate for the purpose of execution. The ruling also upheld the requirement that a condemned person who wished to challenge such a protocol had to propose a “known and available alternative” way to die.</p>
<p>In 2017, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson decided that the state needed to use up its supply of midazolam before it expired. Prosecutors and prison officials worked overtime to execute eight people in 11 days, with some scheduled to die on the same night. Litigation over the state’s protocol raised red flags. In a hearing prior to the first executions, Wendy Kelly, then head of the Arkansas Department of Corrections, testified that a different drug in the state’s three-drug protocol had been “donated” to her after she explained the payment process to the anonymous supplier. <a href="https://arktimes.com/arkansas-blog/2017/04/14/more-on-the-drugs-arkansas-will-use-to-kill-seven">According to</a> the Arkansas Times, “the supplier was worried about his or her identity being revealed to the public through the payment process.”</p>
<p>Only four of the eight executions in Arkansas went through in the end. But the last one was <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2017/11/12/arkansas-death-row-executions-kenneth-williams/" target="_blank">especially</a> disturbing. Kenneth Williams coughed, convulsed, and lurched on the gurney, according to media witnesses, whose accounts were immediately dismissed by government officials. Although the litigation over lethal injection continued after the executions ended, there has been no reckoning over Williams’s disturbing death. One of the officials most responsible for carrying out the state’s execution spree, Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, <a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2020/jul/02/rutledge-running-for-governor-in-22/?elections" target="_blank">announced</a> a run for governor last year.</p>
<p>There are other parallels between the killing spree in Arkansas and the executions in Terre Haute. As with those executed in the federal death chamber last year, lawyers for the condemned in Arkansas scrambled to file legal challenges and clemency petitions for their clients. They contained familiar red flags, from mental illness to childhood trauma to ineffective assistance at trial.</p>
<p>In March 2017, I attended the clemency hearing for <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2017/04/14/as-arkansas-prepares-for-seven-back-to-back-executions-a-victim-requests-clemency/" target="_blank">Marcel Williams</a>, who had raped and killed a young woman in Little Rock in 1994. Although his crimes were unquestionably horrific, they were also partly the product of a life warped by violence and sexual abuse. One clinical psychologist revealed that by the time Williams was 12, his mother was regularly selling his body in exchange for food stamps.</p>
<p>Attorneys for Williams failed to present such evidence during his sentencing trial. Before Williams was <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2017/04/26/how-a-daughters-search-for-her-biological-father-led-her-to-an-execution-in-arkansas/" target="_blank">executed</a> on April 24, 2017 — strapped to the gurney for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/25/arkansas-execution-eyewitness-marcel-williams" target="_blank">more than an hour</a> as the final litigation played out — one of the defense attorneys who represented him at trial told me that it was the first capital murder case he’d ever tried. His failure to present mitigating evidence was especially catastrophic. “I can’t say we even looked for it,” he said.</p>

<h3>The Right to Take a Life</h3>
<p>In the next day or two, if they have not already, the Bureau of Prisons will hand Lisa Montgomery over to the U.S. Marshals, who will fly her to Terre Haute for her execution. Her lawyers will not be told in advance. Nor is it clear how much of an understanding Montgomery will have of her fate. Attorneys have said she has decompensated in recent months. On Friday, her legal team <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y3ulfKSvwA6tczPdXr7CsUNFu2PnGkMR/view" target="_blank">filed</a> a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Southern District of Indiana arguing that she is not competent to be executed due to “co-morbid conditions of serious mental illness, neurological impairment, and complex trauma.”</p>
<p>Although the federal government has not executed a woman since the 1950s, such executions are not quite as rare as they might seem. Sixteen women have been <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-row/women/executions-of-women" target="_blank">killed</a> in state death chambers since the “modern” death penalty era began in 1976. Although many of the executions raised controversy, the politicians most responsible have suffered few consequences, even when their behavior has been callous and cruel. Before he became an ex-president looked upon with nostalgia by many Trump critics, George W. Bush <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1999-08-12-9908120344-story.html" target="_blank">mocked</a> Karla Faye Tucker following her execution in 1998.</p>
<p>Those who carry out executions do not necessarily remain anonymous forever. Years after Tucker’s execution, documentary filmmaker Werner Herzog <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmdSRI8J0a0" target="_blank">interviewed</a> the veteran captain of the execution team in Texas responsible for killing her. Her execution had been no different from any of the others, the man said, yet he found himself shaking afterward.</p>
<p>“And then I started actually visualizing the other inmates,” he said. “I could actually see them in the holding cell again. One right after another.” He realized he could not carry out executions anymore. “From that point on, I’ve had a different outlook in life. &#8230; After Karla Faye and after all this &#8230; no sir. Nobody has the right to take another life. I don’t care if it’s the law. And it’s so easy to change the law.”</p>
<p><strong>Correction: Jan. 10, 2021, 2:20 p.m. ET</strong><br />
<em>A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that only 13 percent of registered voters were aware that federal executions had resumed, according to a December <a href="https://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/athena/files/2020/12/29/5feb6e45c5b6e1ce833d0ac6.pdf">poll</a>. It has been updated to reflect that 40 percent of registered voters had heard “nothing at all” about the executions.</em></p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>In the last</u> days of December, as the president played golf while ignoring both the coronavirus pandemic and the bombing of a U.S. city on Christmas morning, federal prosecutors were working overtime to grant him a parting gift in the name of law and order. After 10 executions in five months, the Department of Justice was planning one last round of killings in the federal death chamber. The executions would bring Donald Trump’s tally to 13, more than any president since Franklin Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Never mind that the last two men slated to die, Corey Johnson and Dustin Higgs, had recently been diagnosed with Covid-19. Both had symptoms of the virus for days before they tested positive at the U.S. penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana. Higgs has a long history of asthma, heart problems, and hypertension. Johnson has exhibited evidence of lung damage, according to his attorneys. But this has not deterred the Justice Department from pushing forward. On December 27, federal prosecutors informed a U.S. district judge that, although neither man had been retested and both still had symptoms, they had been “medically cleared from isolation status.” In other words, they had recovered for the purpose of execution.</p>
<p>Higgs and Johnson were not the only ones to get sick. The virus aggressively spread on federal death row after the back-to-back executions of Brandon Bernard and Alfred Bourgeois on December 10 and 11. At least 14 men had tested positive as of December 21, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/21/us/politics/coronavirus-death-row-executions.html" target="_blank">according</a> to the New York Times, though the figure has grown much higher. One source with close ties to death row told The Intercept last week that the real number is “at least 30” — 60 percent of the total condemned population in Terre Haute.</p>

<p>There’s good reason to believe that Trump’s execution spree is <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-executions-spreading-coronavirus_n_5fce9022c5b6636e09278857" target="_blank">responsible</a> for the outbreak. Although cases were climbing at the penitentiary before the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/08/02/federal-executions-indiana-trump-coronavirus/" target="_blank">first killings</a> in July, many warned that the federal executions could become superspreader events. The local newspaper called for a <a href="https://www.tribstar.com/opinion/editorials/tribune-star-editorial-with-pandemic-raging-now-not-the-time-for-executions/article_72098498-c2e0-11ea-80b7-eb8eb7549927.html" target="_blank">delay</a> in light of the pandemic. Victims’ families protested that traveling to Terre Haute could put them at risk. On the eve of the first execution, news <a href="https://www.tribstar.com/news/execution-staffer-tests-positive-for-covid-19/article_31feaf82-8ed4-5b2d-90f5-7428beaac836.html" target="_blank">broke</a> that a Bureau of Prisons staffer involved in preparations had tested positive. Nevertheless, the killings moved forward.</p>
<p>As autumn brought a surge in Covid-19 cases across the country, more people connected to the executions began to test positive. In November, lawyers for Lisa Montgomery, the only woman under a federal death sentence, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lawyers-lisa-montgomery-covid-19_n_5fad81b3c5b6d647a39d1794" target="_blank">became sick</a> after visiting their client at FMC Carswell, a Texas medical facility for women in BOP custody. A few weeks later, Yusuf Ahmed Nur, the spiritual adviser to <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/12/26/execution-death-penalty-families-orlando-hall/">Orlando Hall</a>, the eighth man to be executed, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-cruelty-of-continuing-federal-executions-during-a-pandemic_n_5fc9010bc5b61bea2b15de84" target="_blank">tested positive</a> after accompanying him in the death chamber. Shortly afterward, in response to a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/other/federal-executions-time-covid-19" target="_blank">lawsuit</a> by the American Civil Liberties Union, the Bureau of Prisons revealed that eight of approximately 40 members of the execution team had tested positive too. More recently the BOP <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-administration-federal-executions-no-contact-tracing_n_5fee46a6c5b6ec8ae0b24c28?y6h" target="_blank">admitted</a> that it has failed to conduct contact tracing for fear of revealing the identities of those carrying out executions.</p>

<p>Although the return of federal executions after a 17-year hiatus refocused attention onto Terre Haute, the Covid-19 outbreak there <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/committees/death_penalty_representation/publications/project_blog/covid-19-on-death-row/" target="_blank">mirrors</a> death rows all over the country. Cases were documented from Arizona to Tennessee to California, where the virus proved especially deadly. As the year came to a close, the number of known Covid-19 deaths on state death rows stood at 17 — equal to the total number of executions carried out all year in the United States. The most recent came on December 28, when Romell Broom, who famously <a href="https://eji.org/news/ohio-botches-execution-of-romell-broom/">survived a botched execution</a> attempt in 2009, died on Ohio’s death row at the age of 64; his name was placed on the corrections department&#8217;s &#8220;Covid probable list,&#8221; meaning he likely <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/state/2020/12/30/romell-broom-ohio-inmate-who-survived-2009-execution-attempt-dies-likely-of-covid-coronavirus/4085217001/" target="_blank">died from coronavirus complications</a>.</p>
<p>People on death row represent a small fraction of the Covid-19 crisis in the country’s prisons and jails; an <a href="https://apnews.com/article/pandemics-race-and-ethnicity-prisons-united-states-coronavirus-pandemic-0bef0673013aa579551db5ad61b885e0" target="_blank">estimated</a> 275,000 incarcerated people have contracted the virus in the United States and at least 1,700 people have died in custody. Some experts and advocates argue that, with capital punishment on the decline, the real “death penalty” is the lethal medical neglect that comes with mass incarceration. Yet the impact of the virus also speaks volumes about a policy that, by its own metrics, has been a <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/12/03/death-penalty-capital-punishment-data/" target="_blank">failure</a> since the start of the so-called modern death penalty era.</p>
<p>Along with its arbitrariness, racial bias, and track record of condemning the innocent, the American death penalty is increasingly defined not by executions but by the number of people who spend decades languishing in extreme isolation on death row, only to die of disease or old age. Broom’s death in Ohio was preceded by that of 79-year-old James Frazier, the oldest man on the state’s death row. In California, which has carried out a <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/capital-punishment/inmates-executed-1978-to-present/" target="_blank">total of 13</a> executions since the death penalty’s return in 1978, 13 condemned people died of the virus in 2020. One man had been on death row <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/news/2020/07/20/condemned-inmate-troy-ashmus-dies/" target="_blank">since</a> 1986.</p>
<p>If there is any silver lining to Trump’s execution spree, it is that it has reinvigorated momentum against the death penalty. In December, Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley, who introduced <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/4052" target="_blank">legislation</a> to end the federal death penalty last year, sent a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/15/politics/death-penalty-congress-letter-pressley/index.html" target="_blank">letter</a> to President-elect Joe Biden asking him to act on his newfound opposition to capital punishment. “With a stroke of your pen, you can stop all federal executions, prohibit United States attorneys from seeking the death penalty, dismantle death row at FCC Terre Haute, and call for the resentencing of people who are currently sentenced to death,” she wrote. “Each of these elements are critical to help prevent greater harm and further loss of life.”</p>

<h3>Stunning Indifference</h3>
<p>Preventing loss of life is supposed to be one of the reasons the death penalty still exists in the United States. Although evidence has historically <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/facts-and-research/murder-rates/murder-rate-of-death-penalty-states-compared-to-non-death-penalty-states" target="_blank">shown</a> that states with the death penalty on the books do not have lower murder rates than those in other jurisdictions, supporters of capital punishment continue to insist that it is a deterrent. Yet Trump’s executions have exposed the fallacy of executions as a policy carried out in the interest of public safety. In the rest of the country, where the pandemic largely stopped the death penalty in its tracks, some prosecutors nevertheless ignored public health warnings, pushing to move forward with executions and death penalty trials while fighting against exonerations of people on death row.</p>

<p>Scott Coffee, a 24-year veteran of the Clark County public defender office in Las Vegas, who is generally considered Nevada’s <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/12/03/death-penalty-abolition/">leading expert</a> on the death penalty, said that his county is down to just one functioning courtroom — out of more than two dozen in normal times — and that at present, it can only handle short, straightforward proceedings, the polar opposite of a capital trial.</p>
<p>Capital cases are notoriously expensive and time-consuming. They require hours of research, investigation, and preparation by teams of lawyers and investigators; large pools of potential jurors; and expert witnesses who often have to travel from out of state — all things nearly impossible to accomplish amid a pandemic.</p>
<p>“The long and short is that these trials are being delayed for the foreseeable future,” Coffee wrote in an email to The Intercept, “irrespective” of prosecutors’ “desire to go forward.”</p>
<p>Nationally, there were just 18 new death sentences handed down across the U.S. in 2020 (none of them in Nevada), down from a high of 315 imposed in 1996, according to the Death Penalty Information Center’s <a href="https://files.deathpenaltyinfo.org/reports/year-end/YearEndReport2020.pdf">year-end report</a>. And there were just 17 executions, down from a peak of 98 in 1999; 10 of those executions have been carried out by the federal government. <a href="https://tcadp.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Texas-Death-Penalty-Developments-in-2020-FINAL.pdf">Three</a> more were in Texas.</p>
<p>While support for the death penalty <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1606/death-penalty.aspx">continues its steady decline</a>, Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, said that the number of new death sentences in 2020 was artificially low because of the pandemic. “We were going to be near record lows in death sentences and in executions anyway, because that’s just a continuation of the historical pattern,” he said. “But the depth of the decline this year is unquestionably attributable to Covid.” As such, he expects there will be some increase in new sentences in 2021, and particularly an uptick in executions, as officials who faced court-imposed stays and generally sought fewer new dates will undoubtedly try to make up for lost time.</p>
<p>The year saw other milestones too, those that have again highlighted the problems with capital punishment and those that point toward its demise.</p>

<p>In May, Colorado became the 22nd state to abolish the death penalty, clearing its three-man death row. Colorado’s experience offers a stark example of the policy’s <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/12/03/death-penalty-abolition/">arbitrary and racist nature</a>: In a state as white as Colorado, all three of the men on death row were Black, and all three were prosecuted by the same district attorney’s office.</p>
<p>Still, even as the pandemic worsened — and as abolition was all but inevitable — one Colorado prosecutor, Adams County District Attorney Dave Young, a vocal opponent of repeal, <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/04/05/coronavirus-death-penalty-executions/">pressed impossibly forward</a>, trying to quickly convene a death penalty trial against yet another young Black man. Hundreds of potential jurors were called to the courthouse, even though there was no clear plan to <a href="https://www.coloradoindependent.com/2020/03/17/colorado-dearing-death-penalty-trial-jury-pandemic/">keep them safe</a> from the virus. It wasn’t until the end of March, after Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed the abolition bill into law and then ordered a statewide lockdown, that Young backed down and abandoned his efforts.</p>
<p>And despite the burdens the pandemic has posed across the system for lawyers and investigators, there were six death row exonerations in 2020, bringing the total number up to 173. Notably, Walter Ogrod, who’d been sentenced to die in Pennsylvania in 1996, was finally exonerated, after the Philadelphia district attorney’s office concluded that staggering levels of <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/04/05/coronavirus-death-penalty-executions/">official misconduct</a> had plagued his case, ultimately condemning the wrong man for the murder of 4-year-old Barbara Jean Horn.</p>

In the interim, Ogrod became gravely ill, mostly likely with Covid-19; he developed a 106-degree fever and was in respiratory distress. Although a different judge had ordered Ogrod released to a hospital for treatment, Pennsylvania’s corrections department balked and Ogrod was confined to his cell, waiting for Robins New to hear the case, which she finally did in June.</p>
<p>It was a dramatic hearing, held via Zoom, during which an assistant district attorney with the Philadelphia DA’s office <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/06/05/walter-ogrod-wrongful-conviction-overturned-pennsylvania-death-row">delivered an emotional apology</a> to Ogrod, Horn’s mother, and the residents of Philadelphia — a rare occurrence for any actor in the criminal legal system, let alone a prosecutor. “The errors made in this case made the streets less safe and I fear that the true perpetrator … may have brought harm to others,” she said. “That is the impact of … wrongful convictions on our community.”</p>

<p>Indeed, the Covid-19 pandemic has revealed many of the ugly truths about the death penalty system that reformers and abolitionists have long recognized. Ogrod’s case is one example: A corrections department and judge demonstrating stunning indifference toward a man wrongfully condemned in a case where prosecutors and defense attorneys already agreed there had been a gross miscarriage of justice.</p>
<p>Nowhere was this kind of institutional callousness on greater display than in the Trump administration’s rush to execute federal prisoners even as the administration failed to control the pandemic. “I think the recent actions by the federal government of simply lining up as many people as possible for execution should frighten all of us,” Coffee said. “This is what happens when the powers that be care more about appearances than due process and serves as a stark reminder of why we need to repeal Nevada’s death penalty. Like many other states, we are but one leadership change away [from] committing the same atrocities.”</p>

<h3>An Inflection Point</h3>
<p>For those on federal death row who survive both the virus and Trump’s killing spree, the future will largely depend on whether Biden lives up to his promises. Biden, who was instrumental in expanding the federal death penalty — and who was the last Democratic presidential candidate to come out against capital punishment — has remained silent about the killings in Terre Haute. After the last round of execution dates was announced in November, a spokesperson <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-prisons-inaugurations-coronavirus-pandemic-executions-365258989e6be8d7077b2f67d8c3e190" target="_blank">told</a> the Associated Press simply that Biden “opposes the death penalty now and in the future.”</p>
<p>Even if Johnson and Higgs recover from Covid-19 in time for their executions, their lawyers warn that any lasting lung damage from their illness has already compounded the risk of an excruciating death. Medical experts, autopsies, and witness accounts have long raised red flags about the government’s lethal injection protocol, which shows evidence of causing flash pulmonary edema, a harrowing sensation akin to <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/02/07/death-penalty-lethal-injection-midazolam-ohio/">waterboarding</a>.</p>
<p>Those who are still sick on death row are also at higher risk for bad outcomes. “This is another case of everything that goes bad with the criminal legal system goes worse for the death penalty,” said Dunham, DPIC&#8217;s executive director. People on death row are “uniquely vulnerable in multiple ways,” especially since they live in solitary confinement and under a high level of stress, which makes them especially susceptible to illness. “There is no comparable stress to being on death row,” Dunham said.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[8](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[8] -->“These are people’s lives and we cannot trust the government to handle this policy responsibly.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[8] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[8] -->
<p>This has been especially true for the men in Terre Haute. In emails to The Intercept, death row residents have described the horror of watching friends and neighbors taken to die, coupled with a constant, pervasive fear of new execution dates. One man described it as a combination of “life-draining sadness” and impending danger. “This place is really affecting me,” he wrote in November. “When the guards do rounds, their keys clang and that noise is all of a sudden jarring, piercing my ears, hurting my ear drums, causing me major turbulence. And this never used to bother me.”</p>
<p>Dunham thinks 2020 may end up being an “inflection point” for the death penalty. “There are events that change the trajectory of debate on an issue. And there are points that death penalty opponents have been making for years — that this isn’t something you can trust with the government, because there’s always going to be somebody who’s coming in who is completely unreasonable,” he said. “This is not a toy. These are people’s lives and we cannot trust the government to handle this policy responsibly.”</p>
<p>Dunham is relatively optimistic that the failings of the system highlighted amid the pandemic may push additional states toward abolition. He thinks that it may be imminent in Wyoming, which has been on the cusp of repealing its death penalty statute for the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/12/03/death-penalty-abolition/%23the-abolitionists">past few years</a>. Marguerite Herman, who is a member of the leadership team of the League of Women Voters of Cheyenne and among a diverse coalition of folks pushing for abolition in the state, isn’t sure that 2021 will be the year; a number of moderate Republicans who were on board, or nearly so, were voted out of office in November, making repeal less likely. Still, she remains confident that it will happen — after all, Wyoming’s death penalty isn’t exactly functional.</p>

<p>Four people have been sent to death row in Wyoming, according to a dataset <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/series/the-condemned/">compiled by The Intercept</a> of more than 7,000 individuals sentenced to death in <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/12/03/death-penalty-capital-punishment-data/">active death penalty states</a> and the federal system since 1976. Of those four, only one has been executed. The other three have had their sentences overturned. Two were resentenced to life with the possibility of parole. The fourth is awaiting resentencing. Meanwhile, the policy has cost the state roughly $1 million per year.</p>
<p>As The Intercept’s dataset demonstrates, Wyoming’s experience with capital punishment is on par with the nation as a whole. Just 20 percent of the more than 7,000 people sentenced to die have been executed. A staggering 44 percent are no longer on death row for some other reason; the vast majority have had their sentences reduced, and hundreds have been released from prison altogether. Black people account for 40 percent of those sentenced to die. At least 51 percent of the total are people of color.</p>
<p>Even as politicians acknowledge the death penalty’s obvious failures, several seem content to put off abolition indefinitely. Pennsylvania has not used its death chamber since 1999; in 2015, Gov. Tom Wolf declared a <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/committees/death_penalty_representation/project_press/2015/summer/pennsylvania-governor-declares-moratorium-on-death-penalty/">moratorium</a> on executions, calling the death penalty “ineffective, unjust, and expensive.” Yet more than 150 people remain on death row in the state. In California, where the execution chamber at San Quentin State Prison was dramatically dismantled almost two years ago, more than 700 people remain in limbo. Like Biden, Gov. Gavin Newsom could <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/03/13/california-death-penalty-moratorium/">finish what he started</a> and commute their sentences to life — a logical move for someone who has described the death penalty as “fundamentally immoral.” But such political courage is hard to come by.</p>
<p>As for Coffee, he feels that abolition in Nevada is on the horizon. It’s become a regular topic of discussion at the state Capitol, and he thinks the broader awakening around the failings of the criminal justice system combined with the fallout from the pandemic — the court disruptions, the loss of life, the economic destruction — may help more people realize what a fallible, barbaric, and ultimately failed policy the death penalty is.</p>
<p>“I am hopeful that the repeal efforts will succeed in this session. The move toward progressive criminal justice reforms has opened the eyes of many to the various problems inherent in the criminal justice system, but I have to say I can’t think of an area where this is more obvious than in the death penalty,” he wrote. “People are coming to realize that even if you believe in the death penalty, there is no fair, just, and accurate way to determine who deserves it. There are so many other places that the money wasted on this cruel endeavor could be spent that I hope, maybe, the end is in sight.”</p>
