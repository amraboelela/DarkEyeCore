<p>According to an announcement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Ohio, Howard and his co-defendants, including Robert Nathaniel Andre Thomas, Tyvione Guthery, and Jaelen D. Lattimore, purchased stolen financial information on the darkweb, including credit card numbers and debit card numbers.</p>
<p>Howard created fraudulent credit cards by embossing cards with the stolen information purchased on the darkweb. Then Howard and his co-conspirators would purchase expensive merchandise, including jewelry and watches. In a criminal complaint, an FBI Special Agent wrote that investigators had learned that Howard had a “Joker’s Stash” account.</p>

<p>The criminal complaint described one interaction with law enforcement and one of Howard’s co-conspirators:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“On or about January 6, 2021, a fraudulent transaction was reported at Sheiban Jewelers, 16938 Pearl Road, Strongsville, Ohio, belonging to victim J.M (real name known to affiant) for a total loss of $14,500. The fraudulent transaction took place on or about December 19, 2020, in which the store received a call from GUTHERY who stated that he would come to the store on the same date to make a purchase of a Rolex Yacht-Master watch.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“When GUTHERY arrived, he presented his driver’s license to the employee and provided a credit card for a layaway amount of $7,000. GUTHERY then left the store but returned later with HOWARD; video surveillance shows both GUTHERY and HOWARD entering the store. When GUTHERY and HOWARD returned to the store, they paid the full amount and received the Rolex watch.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Surveillance video also captured a Lexus G350 driven by GUTHERY, which was registered to PARRISH. On January 1, 2021, <strong>Strongsville Police Department Patrolman John Murphy spoke to GUTHERY on a phone call</strong>; the call was recorded. During the conversation, <strong>GUTHERY admitted that he was the one who drove to HOWARD in PARRISH’s car to the jewelry store</strong>. GUTHERY <strong>identified the other male as his cousin</strong> HASAN (HOWARD). GUTHERY stated that <strong>HOWARD provided GUTHERY with the credit cards</strong> and billing address of the victim to GUTHERY. GUTHERY stated that HOWARD also provided PARRISH with stolen credit card information that PARRISH used at a BMW dealership to repair her vehicle in Willoughby Hills, Ohio.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On May 20, 2021, police arrested Howard and Lattimore after they had purchased more than $20,000 worth of jewelry from jewelers in  Aurora, Ohio. Police found an embossing machine and three Rolex watches in Howard’s possession.</p>
<p>Howard and his co-conspirators used stolen credit card information to purchase merchandise at 30 stores, causing $261,319.28 in damages.</p>

    <p>A federal grand jury returned an indictment charging two men for selling counterfeit pills on the darkweb.</p>
<p><em>Edited on July 8, 2022, to correct a price listed in a previous version of this article.</em></p>
<p>According to an announcement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Indiana, Ethan Parker, 29, of Evansville, used a pill press to manufacture fentanyl-laced counterfeit pills. Parker sold the pressed pills to co-conspirators, including Joshua Harvey, 30, of Evansville. Harvey then resold pills to “mid-level distributors” in their drug trafficking organization, mainly in the Evansville, Indiana, area.</p>
<p>Parker obtained pound quantities of fentanyl powder from “an unknown source of supply” in Louisville, Kentucky. Harvey also drove Parker to a supplier to “acquire pound quantities of fentanyl powder to facilitate the manufacture and distribution of fentanyl-laced counterfeit pills,” according to the press release.</p>

<p>Harvey and other co-conspirators would purchase pills and communicate with Parker through encrypted messaging applications and Facebook messages. In one instance, Parker directed Harvey to a “channel” on an encrypted messaging application where Parket sold counterfeit pills. In the channel, Parket advertised 50 pills for $375, 100 pills for $750, and 1,000 pills for $5,000. The indictment does not identify the “encrypted” messaging application but based on the description provided, it appears to be referencing Telegram.</p>
<p>On March 10, 2022, Harvey sent Parker a message through Facebook about aquiring counterfeit pills. Parker directed Harvey to a “webpage on the darkweb” where Parker sold pills.</p>

<p>Durio and Toliver purchased stolen credit card numbers from sources on the darkweb, according to a press release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Toliver also purchased cards from a source he had met in prison.</p>
<p>With the assistance of several co-conspirators, Durio and Toliver created templates for credit cards on their computers and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“downloaded credit card templates on laptop computers and transferred the stolen credit card numbers into the templates, which were then used to create tens of thousands of fraudulent access devices. The cards would generally be printed in batches with the same name appearing on numerous cards. The name was typically the real name of a co-conspirator. The cards were embossed with numbers, and corresponding account information was encoded on the strips on the back of the cards.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Durio and Toliver distributed thousands of fraudulent credit cards to people who purchased valuable merchandise or gift cards.</p>
<p>Investigators learned about the operation after arresting people who had cards produced by Durio in their possession. Law enforcement officers from the Secret Service “were able to tie these card seizures to the plants” operated by Durio.</p>
<p>During the execution of a search warrant at the office park in Houston, feds seized access to device-making equipment, embossers, scanners, high-end printers, thousands of fraudulent credit cards, and a laptop computer. Durio had saved 80,000 stolen credit card numbers in files on the computer. On other computers used by Durio, feds found approximately 300,000 additional stolen card numbers.</p>

    <p>The administrator of one of the “world’s largest child pornography websites” was sentenced to two years in prison for hiding proceeds from the forum.</p>
<p>Son Jong-woo, the convicted operator of the Welcome To Video forum on the darkweb, was sentenced to five years in prison for concealing about 400 million won ($305,000). The money came from users of Son’s forum who spent Bitcoin to access child sexual abuse material (CSAM).</p>
<p>The defendant has already served an 18-month sentence for violating child protection laws. A grand jury in the United States returned an indictment, accusing Son of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conspiracy to Advertise Child Pornography;</li>
<li>Advertising Child Pornography;</li>
<li>Production of Child Pornography for Importation to the United States;</li>
<li>Conspiracy to Distribute Child Pornography;</li>
<li>Distribution of Child Pornography; and</li>
<li>Money Laundering.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before Son completed his sentence, <a href="http://darkzzx4avcsuofgfez5zq75cqc4mprjvfqywo45dfcaxrwqg6qrlfid.onion/post/welcome-to-video-admin-sued-by-father-to-block-extradition/" title="‘Welcome to Video” Admin Fights Extradition with a Lawsuit" 
>his father filed a criminal complaint</a> against him for “violation of the law on criminal proceeds concealment.” The move was interpreted as an attempt to prevent Son’s extradition to the United States.</p>

>Seoul High Court blocked Son’s extradition</a> because Son’s cooperation would assist authorities in investigating “sexually exploitative content.” Authorities then filed new charges against Son, including criminal proceeds concealment and gambling with the concealed proceeds.</p>
<p>The Korean National Police in South Korea arrested Son on March 5, 2018. Agents from the IRS-CI, HSI, and National Crime Agency in the United Kingdom seized the servers Son had used to host the onion service. The operation resulted in the seizure of eight terabytes of CSAM. A Department of Justice press release revealed that 45% of the 250,000 unique videos seized by police contained new images.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Welcome To Video offered these videos for sale using the cryptocurrency bitcoin. Typically, sites of this kind give users a forum to trade in these depictions. This Darknet website is among the first of its kind to monetize child exploitation videos using bitcoin. In fact, the site itself boasted over one million downloads of child exploitation videos by users. Each user received a unique bitcoin address when the user created an account on the website. An analysis of the server revealed that the website had more than one million bitcoin addresses, signifying that the website had capacity for at least one million users.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The agencies have shared data from the seized server with law enforcement around the world to assist in identifying and prosecuting customers of the site. This has resulted in leads sent to 38 countries and yielded arrests of 337 subjects around the world. The operation has resulted in searches of residences and businesses of approximately 92 individuals in the United States. Notably, the operation is responsible for the rescue of at least 23 minor victims residing in the United States, Spain and the United Kingdom, who were being actively abused by the users of the site.”</p>

    <p>A Washington man who sold methamphetamine on the darkweb was sentenced to five years in prison.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney Nick Brown announced that Ryan Kane, 34, of Bothell, Washington, had been sentenced to five years in prison. Kane had pleaded guilty to one count of Possession of Methamphetamine with Intent to Distribute in March 2022.</p>
<p>The investigation that resulted in Kane’s arrest began in March 2021 after the Australian Border Force (ABF) had seized 39 computer hard drives containing crystal methamphetamine from a UPS package. The “seizure weight” was fou kilograms.</p>
<p>On April 25, 2021, a United States Postal Service (USPS) outbound mail parcel arrived at the SFO International Mail Facility destined for Australia. The package was declared a “3.5IN DESKTOP HARDDRIVE,” and a Customs and Border Protention officer referred the package for inspection. Officers x-rayed the package, which revealed inconsistencies between the description and the image, according to the criminal complaint.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“In the image, the inside of the hard drives appeared granular, as if they were full of thousands of small particles. This is in stark contrast to a smooth solid piece of metal or plastic seen from a legitimate hard drive. A physical examination of USPS Package 1 revealed 18 vacuum sealed hard drives. Furthermore, CBPO Salas opened a hard drive and observed a crystalline substance inside. CBPO Coleman tested the suspected substance inside the hard drive and it field-tested positive for methamphetamine. CBPO Salas calculated the gross weight of the hard drives with the methamphetamine to be 8,096 grams.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On April 27, 2021, a similar USPS package arrived at the San Francisco International Mail Facility destined for Australia. The package was declared as a “3.5IN DESKTOP HARDDRIVE.” Customs officers refereed the package for inspection. Officers x-rayed the package, noted the same inconsistencies in the first package, and then opened the package.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The wrapping and feel of the hard drives were inconsistent with what’s expected of a new drive. Furthermore, CBPO Salas opened a hard drive and a crystalline substance was found inside. CBPO Salas conducted a field test on the substance contained inside the hard drive and determined that the substance was methamphetamine. CBPO Salas determined that the total gross weight of the meth and hard drives was 8,173 grams.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>USPS business records revealed that someone using the I.P. address 50.106.18.109 had tracked the first USPS package eight times and the second USPS package three times. The I.P. address was assigned to Ziply Fiber, an Internet Service Provider. Records from Ziply Fiber identify the subscriber for the I.P. address as Ryan Kane at 12618 NE 180th S.T., Apt EE302 Bothell, WA 98011.</p>
<p>On June 7, 2021, agents executed a search warrant at Kane’s apartment, vehicle, and person. Agents found 1,844.1 grams of methamphetamine inside a jar in Kane’s bedroom.</p>

<p>Kane told agents that he knew about the methamphetamine in his apartment and admitted that he had been selling it. However, Kane also told agents that an outlaw motorcycle gang had extorted him into selling the methamphetamine. “The Defendant refused to provide any names of individuals who had threatened him or supplied the methamphetamine,” Special Agent Matt Eidinger wrote in the criminal complaint.</p>

<p>Court documents do not disclose the username of Kane’s vendor account. They do identify Wallstreet Market as one of the marketplaces Kane had used.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Specifically, on October 17, 2019, Mr. Kane received an order for five grams of methamphetamine from the Dark Web marketplace Wall Street. Mr. Kane processed and packaged the methamphetamine and shipped the package. The parcel contained approximately five grams of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The total gross weight of the methamphetamine was 8,280.4 grams.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge James L. Robart said at the sentencing hearing, addressing Kane, “This isn’t about you…. This is about what you did to the community …sending drugs not just into our community, but the world. What you did is decidedly wrong.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Kane’s conviction and today’s sentence demonstrates how smugglers cannot hide behind the perceived veil of secrecy associated with Dark Web marketplaces,” said Special Agent in Charge (SAC) Robert Hammer, who oversees Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) operations in the Pacific Northwest. “HSI through its transnational law enforcement footprint will doggedly pursue these cases with our law enforcement partners within the U.S. and abroad.”</p>

<p>On March 8, 2021, law enforcement officers from Homeland Security Investigations, the United States Postal Inspection Service, the West Virginia State Police, and the West Virginia National Guard Reconnaissance and Aerial Interdiction Detachment executed a search warrant at Parson’s residence.</p>
<p>While searching Parsons’ residence, officers seized 66 grams of methamphetamine in 103 bags, 27 grams of heroin, and quantities of MDA, ketamine, LSD, psilocin, and DMT. They also found a Hi-Point .380 ACP pistol and ammunition under the driver’s seat of Parsons’ vehicle.</p>
<p>During questioning, Parsons told officers that he had purchased the methamphetamine and other substances on the darkweb to resell them. He also told officers that he had ordered another package of methamphetamine that had not yet arrived. On March 15, 2021, officers seized the package. Inside it, they found 223 grams of methamphetamine.</p>
<p>In June 2021, a grand jury returned an indictment accusing Parsons of possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine, possession of heroin, and being a felon in possession of a firearm.</p>
<p>In a sentencing memorandum, Parsons’ attorney described the previous offenses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“His offense conduct consisted of breaking into an adult novelty store four different times and first stealing $ 1,745 merchandise, then $ 59,172 in-merchandise, and then twice taking the safe; breaking into a Burger King to steal $ 7,742.23 in merchandise; breaking into a pawn shop to steal three firearms having a combined value of $ 1,049; breaking into a different adult boutique to steal $ 3,300 cash and $5,420 in merchandise; breaking into a Chinese restaurant and stealing $1,103 in property; breaking into the safe of a sports center and stealing $ 2,300 in property.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the first time, and the entire safe the second time, and breaking into a chiropractic practice stealing property valued at $3,835."</p>
<p>In March 2022, Parsons pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine. On June 30, 2022, Judge Irene Berger sentenced Parsons to ten years in prison, followed by five years on supervised release.</p>

<p>In March 2019, Inspector Gentiluomo and another postal inspector (UC) met with Le at a hotel. The parties agreed to exchange $200,000 in Bitcoin in a wired hotel room. After Le had sent the Bitcoin to the address provided by the feds, the second postal inspector pretended to be having problems with his cellphone. He asked Le to open the wallet application on his phone and verify that the transaction had been completed. Le handed his unlocked phone to the postal inspector. After the postal inspector had possession of Le’s phone, postal inspectors and state police entered the room and detained Le.</p>

    <p>A man who admitted purchasing counterfeit oxycodone pills on the darkweb was sentenced to 18 months of probation for possessing firearms as a drug user.</p>
<p>In an Omaha, Nebraska, court, Chief Judge Robert F. Rossiter, Jr. sentenced 46-year-old Edward Barta to 18 months of probation for one count of possession of firearms by a drug user.</p>
<p>In late 2020, federal law enforcement officers intercepted a package of apparent oxycodone pills en route to 46-year-old Edward Barta’s residence. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents tested two seized pills and learned the active ingredients were fentanyl and fentanyl 4-ANPP.</p>
<p>On December 20, 2020, DEA agents executed a search warrant at Barta’s residence in Omaha. During the search, agents found more pills and a pill grinder. They also found a Smith & Wesson M&P 9mm handgun, a Taurus Millennium G2, and a Mossberg 342KA rifle inside a locked safe in Barta’s house.</p>
<p>Barta told DEA agents that he had purchased 100 oxycodone pills from a vendor on the darkweb for $800 in Bitcoin. He said he had completed ten orders of between 60 and 80 pills per order.</p>
<p>The report said Barta told investigators he ordered 100 oxycodone 30 mg pills from a dark web vendor in exchange for $800 and that he had made approximately ten prior orders of about 60 to 80 pills per order. Barta reported to the police that he took three pills daily to manage his chronic neck pain.</p>
<p>In one court document, Barta’s attorney provided some background on Barta’s oxycodone purchases:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mr. Barta suffers from chronic pain due a neck injury. Mr. Barta was under the care of a doctor for the pain, which ultimately led to a dependence on oxycodone. Despite being prescribed Duloxetine, it was not the proper amount for this pain. Mr. Barta sought oxycodone on the dark web for his personal use. He did not order an amount over a personal use amount, and thankfully was not killed when the oxycodone pills were later discovered to be fentanyl […].”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mr. Barta finds himself before this Court on charges brought over a year after his law enforcement contact. Even though he was not arrested on December 20, 2020, Mr. Barta used the contact as a wakeup call, and immediately sought treatment. He did not wait for Christmas to be over; instead, he went to treatment and missed spending the holidays with his children. He is under the care of a treating physician who increased the Duloxetine to an amount in which gives Mr. Barta relief from pain. Mr. Barta continues to abstain from opioids.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In February 2021, a federal grand jury returned an indictment accusing Barta of possessing a firearm as a drug user. Although Barta entered a guilty plea, his attorney wrote that Barta did not know he had violated any laws by possessing firearms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Mr. Barta did not know it was unlawful to be in possession of the firearms, and there is no evidence that Mr. Barta ever used the firearms. Mr. Barta had the firearms in locked cases and never discharged them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arguing for a base level reduction of eight points, Barta’s attorney wrote that Barta’s firearms were “solely possessed for collection purposes.” Interesting choices for collectors firearms. I will say that.</p>

</p>
<p>Chief Judge Robert F. Rossiter, Jr. sentenced Barta to 18 months without special conditions.</p>
<hr />
<p>Pretty decent outcome for Barta. He failed two drug tests for THC during pretrial release.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Barta has been extremely successful on pretrial release. He had two (2) positive tests from taking Delta 8. When he failed the urine test, he stopped taking Delta 8, and had negative tests after the Delta 8 was no longer in his system. He completed treatment before these charges were even filed and is maintaining his sobriety. He has shown over a year of adhering to the court’s orders and success. He realizes his addiction is life threatening and lifelong. He takes his sobriety seriously and would request a term of probation without incarceration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is the court simply accepting the attorney’s statement as factual or can a lab actually differentiate between Delta 8 and Delta 9?</p>

    <p>Although China’s anti-drug measures have been generally successful, authorities have seen an increase in drug traffickers’ use of the internet and cryptocurrencies.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In 2021, China’s anti-drug departments “earnestly implemented” General Secretary Xi Jinping’s instructions on reducing illicit drug use. The measures have resulted in success by most standards. Although drug crimes and drug abuse have generally decreased, the Chinese government has noted an increase in drug money laundering via cryptocurrencies. In addition, people are increasingly turning to the internet to buy and sell drugs.</p>

<p>A jury convicted Digweed of conspiring to supply Class A drugs, including heroin, cocaine, ecstasy powder, and 2CB, and Class B drugs cannabis, ketamine, and amphetamine. The jury also convicted him of money laundering. During the trial, prosecutors showed the jury evidence of Digweed’s involvement in the supply of 12.5kg of heroin, 30-35kg of cocaine, 80kg of cannabis, 4kg of ketamine, and 3kg of amphetamine.</p>
<p>Merseyside Police arrested Digweed in March 2021 as a part of <a href="http://darkzzx4avcsuofgfez5zq75cqc4mprjvfqywo45dfcaxrwqg6qrlfid.onion/tags/encrochat/" title="EncroChat articles on Darknetlive"

</p>
<p>After law enforcement agencies had hacked EncroChat, investigators examined messages sent and received by a drug dealer under the username “Diorpaw.” Investigators said Digweed identified himself in his messages to other EncroChat users.</p>
<p>In one example provided by police, one of Digweed’s contacts sent him a picture of a block of marijuana labeled “Johnny Weed.” Digweed responded, “HaHaHaHa lad who’s done that, its only missing dig out the name” My names Johnny Digweed init.” Digweed then sent the image to other EncroChat users. “His messages on the dark web revealed that he supplied drugs across the northwest and managed the supply of crack cocaine and heroin to Devon and Cornwall,” police said. Digweed referenced Cornwall, Bristol, Middlesbrough, London, Weston-Super-Mare, and Wales in other messages.</p>
<p>Superintendent Graeme Robson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Digweed’s covert messages via EncroChat revealed his clear involvement as a leading figure in drug conspiracies that could have caused immense suffering to families and residents in our community. In one message sent to other handles he brazenly identified himself in messages. The messages he sent also revealed that he operated a sophisticated and organised criminal enterprise.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“We know the destruction that drugs cause and Merseyside Police remains relentless in our pursuit of these criminals and to bring down serious and organised criminal groups. I hope this result shows that Merseyside Police, will leave no stone unturned in our pursuit of these people who think they are above the law, and we will continue to target criminals like Digweed by thoroughly examining any evidence, messages and images we find.”</p>

    <p>The blockchain analysis firm Elliptic identified Dogecoin as a cryptocurrency increasingly linked to criminal activity, including darknet market usage.</p>
<p>Elliptic, which offers blockchain intelligence solutions similar to Chainalysis, published a report identifying an increase in the use of Dogecoin for illicit activity on the internet. The report demonstrates that Dogecoin is rarely used for illegal purposes.</p>
<p>According to the company, the meme coin’s criminal uses include fraud, scams, ponzi schemes, terrorism financing, malware, transactions on darkweb markets, and the child sexual abuse material (CSAM) industry. Elliptic also identified so-called “far-right extremism” as one form of the “illicit use of Doge.”</p>

<p>“While a small sum compared to Bitcoin and Tether, this example demonstrates the awareness, and increasing adoption, of a wide variety of cryptoassets by groups such as Hamas. It also reinforces the importance of blockchain analytics solutions in a compliance toolkit to enable financial institutions and law enforcement agencies to screen for risk beyond just the most popular cryptoassets.”</p>

<p>Elliptic monitors child sexual abuse material (CSAM) vendors on the darknet and clearnet. The majority of cryptocurrency payments to CSAM vendors are in Bitcoin. “A small and growing number of these vendors accept other crypto assets – including Dogecoin,” the report claims. Elliptic explains that there has been $3,000 worth of Doge payments to CSAM vendors <em>to date</em>.</p>

<p>The report highlighted two malware campaigns that involved Dogecoin.</p>
<p>Cliptomaner, identified by Kaspersky in October 2020, hijacks a user’s clipboard to swap cryptocurrency addresses for addresses controlled by the attackers. Cliptomaner hijacks Doge addresses, among other cryptocurrencies, and has received almost $29,000 in Doge.</p>
<p>In July 2020, Intezer identified the “Doki” malware campaign, which used:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“a previously undocumented method to contact its operator by abusing the Dogecoin cryptocurrency blockchain in a unique way in order to dynamically generate its C2 domain address. The malware has managed to stay under the radar for over six months despite samples being publicly available in VirusTotal.”</p>

<p>Elliptic laments that when “payments companies such as PayPal, Visa and Mastercard” freeze accounts owned by nominally right-wing people, they “turn instead to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.” By attempting to raise funds without using mainstream payment platforms, these targets of financial censorship have “increasingly <em>exploited the internet</em>,” Elliptic claims.</p>
<p>According to the report, the basic CivNat news outlet Infowars (“leftists are the real racists”) is an example of an extremist right-wing group embracing cryptocurrency. To date, Infowars has raised “over $1,700 in Doge alone.”</p>

<hr />
<p>The report seems accurate in that Dogecoin use has increased since its launch. I am skeptical that illicit Doge use is worth consideration. When I had a Twitter account, I saw countless scams involving Elon Musk imposters and various cryptocurrencies, including Doge. The total earnings of cryptocurrency scammers on Twitter dwarf the examples of illicit cryptocurrency use provided by Elliptic. For instance, during one weekend in February 2021, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/twitter-scammers-earned-over-145k-this-week-in-bitcoin-ethereum-doge/" title="Twitter scammers earned over $145k this week in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Doge"

    <p>A man who purchased a diamond necklace with a credit card from the darkweb is facing 15 years in prison.</p>
<p>An affidavit filed by a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations accuses Demonn Chadwick Jenkins II, 27, of fraudulent use of credit card information.</p>
<p>On June 16, 2022, Jenkins used a Capital One Platinum Mastercard in someone else’s name to purchase a diamond necklace for $9990 and a Rolex watch for $10,800 at a jewelry store on Main Street in St. Thomas.</p>

</p>
<p>The next day, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Officers at the Cyril E. King Airport searched Jenkins’ bag and discovered the necklace and watch. According to the affidavit, Jenkins “failed to declare the purchases of the jewelry on his Customs and Border Protection Declaration form.” Jenkins had planned to return to Atlanta, Georgia, on June 17, 2022.</p>
<p>“He was later identified as the purchaser of the jewelry using footage taken from the jewelry store’s security cameras,” according to a press release from the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Virgin Islands. Based on that information, Jenkins likely told CBP officers that he had not purchased the jewelry in St. Thomas. If he had the jewelry before arriving on the island and did not alter it while on the island, he would not need to pay the Customs Duties for those purchases.</p>

<p>When questioned by CBP officers, “Jenkins admitted that he purchased the Mastercard on the Dark Web for approximately $15.”</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Adam Sleeper filed a motion to detain Jenkins until his trial because he “has previously been arrested for committing similar crimes.”</p>
<p>On June 21, 2022, U.S. Magistrate Ruth Miller released Jenkins to a third-party custodian.</p>
<p>If convicted, Jenkins faces 15 years in prison.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The safeguarding of our communities will always be our priority. Whilst the seizure of the firearms during this investigation is very disturbing I want to reassure people that guns like this are, thankfully, very unusual here in south Wales. Such was the weight of evidence against the majority of these defendants that he had no option but to enter guilty pleas. This is down to the hard work and dedication of my investigation team. The success of this investigation demonstrates that we will relentlessly pursue those involved in large scale criminality to ensure effective justice is sought against such individuals and they are brought to justice.”</p>

<p>“On July 12, 2007, a series of air-to-ground attacks were conducted by a team of two U.S. AH-64 Apache helicopters in Al-Amin al-Thaniyah, New Baghdad, during the Iraqi insurgency which followed the Iraq War. On April 5, 2010, the attacks received worldwide coverage and controversy following the release of 39 minutes of gunsight footage by the Internet whistleblower website WikiLeaks. The footage was portrayed as classified, but the individual who leaked it, U.S. Army soldier Chelsea Manning, testified in 2013 that the video was not classified. The video, which WikiLeaks titled Collateral Murder, showed the crew firing on a group of men and killing several of them, then laughing at some of the casualties, all of whom were civilians, including two Reuters journalists. An anonymous U.S. military official confirmed the authenticity of the footage, which provoked global discussion on the legality and morality of the attacks.”</p>

<p>Foreign laws now determine the limits of press freedom in this country and the journalism that won the industry’s most prestigious prizes has been deemed an extraditable offence and worthy of a life sentence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The path to Julian’s freedom is long and tortuous. Today is not the end of the fight. It is only the beginning of a new legal battle. We will appeal through the legal system; the next appeal will be before the High Court. We will fight louder and shout harder on the streets, we will organise and we will make Julian’s story known to all.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Make no mistake, this has always been a political case. Julian published evidence that the country trying to extradite him committed war crimes and covered them up; tortured and rendered; bribed foreign officials; and corrupted judicial inquiries into US wrongdoing. Their revenge is to try to disappear him into the darkest recesses of their prison system for the rest of his life to deter others from holding governments to account.</p>

<p>We will not let that happen. Julian’s freedom is coupled to all our freedoms. We will fight to return Julian to his family and to regain freedom of expression for us all”.</p>

    <p>Simon Barclay</p>
  </figcaption></figure>
</p>
<p>Barclay was identified following months of investigations into drug trafficking on the darkweb by the Eastern Region Special Operations Unit (ERSOU). After establishing that Barclay was running three darkweb vendor accounts, the ERSOU contacted the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Cyber Crime Unit and Kirklees Police, who launched a joint investigation.</p>
<p>During the investigations, investigators allegedly saw Barclay make regular drop-offs of packages to a post office close to his residence. On November 3, 2021, the investigators stopped Barclay on his way to the post office. He was carrying a bag that had several drug packages addressed to different people.</p>
<p>The investigators subsequently searched two properties linked to the defendant. The searches resulted in the seizure of cocaine and heroin worth £1.2 million. The investigators also seized several electronic devices. Forensic analysis of the seized electronic devices led to the seizure of cryptocurrency worth approximately £5.5 million.</p>
<p>Barclay pleaded guilty to possession of Class A and B and possession of cryptocurrency linked to a crime.</p>
<p>Det Insp Simon Reddington of the Kirklees Police Programme Precision Team:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Barclay has clearly been a significant player in the possession and sale of Class A drugs in Kirklees and nationally this has been reflected in the sentence he has been given today. He was caught as a result of detailed collaborative working between Kirklees Police and partner agencies operating as part of UK DICE. Barclay’s use of the dark web proved to be the key to opening the door to his drugs network and this operation truly demonstrates the effectiveness of information sharing between the police and our national and regional partners.”</p>

<p>Last month, a court sentenced Grant’s younger brother Liam Grant, 25, to four years and six months in prison after he had pleaded guilty to the same charges.</p>
<p>According to an announcement from the Merseyside Police, the arrests are a part of Operation Venetic. Police described the operation as “an international operation targeting criminals who used a mobile encryption service, commonly referred to as EncroChat, in an attempt to evade detection.”</p>

EncroChat usually sold Samsung phones with a modified version of Android. Some units had no functioning GPS, camera, or microphone. The phones came pre-installed with the EncroChat application as well as other applications provided by the company. EncroChat, the application, “routed conversations through a central server based in France.” The service had roughly 60,000 users at the time of its closure.”</p>

<p>“The French National Gendarmerie, assisted by law enforcement in the Netherlands, installed malware on EncroChat servers in France. “The malware allowed them to read messages before they were sent and record lock screen passwords,” according to a Wikipedia entry on the company. The malware affected more than half the devices in Europe, according to the company. Law enforcement agencies worldwide received access to the data pulled from the hacked EncroChat server.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Merseyside Police detectives identified the brothers by examining “a series of messages and photographs” shared through EncroChat. In one example provided by the police, the brothers discussed ways to travel unmolested by law enforcement during lockdowns. One of the brothers shared a screenshot of an eBay listing for an ambulance and wrote, “buy a ambulance jacket of eBay‚ never get pulled.”</p>

<p>Detective Sergeant Graeme Kehoe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The fact the Grant brothers pleaded guilty again illustrates the strength of evidence that we have to bring drug dealers who used Encrochat to justice, and prevent them from flooding the streets with drugs. Op Venetic is continuing to expose criminals who thought they could evade detection by using the encrypted devices.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Bringing the Grant brothers to justice has disrupted not only the serious organised crime they were involved in, but street level drug deals and county lines operations involving vulnerable young people. I hope this sends a clear message to criminals that we’ll persist in our pursuit to get them behind bars.”</p>

    <p>A federal grand jury returned a four-count indictment accusing four alleged drug dealers of shipping kilograms of fentanyl pills across the United States.</p>
<p>The indictment charges Derrean Wall, Cortez West, Dayareon Crofton,  and Floyd Head with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance. Wall faces three additional counts of possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance.</p>
<p>In January 2022, postal inspectors seized a suspicious package en route to Cleveland, Ohio. Later, investigators learned the package contained 2.2 kilograms of fentanyl pills. During the investigation that followed the package seizure, police allegedly identified Crofton, Head, and West as the senders of the package.</p>
<p>Over the next three months, police arrested Crofton, Head, and West. Police seized approximately two kilograms of fentanyl pills from each defendant.</p>
<p>On April 27, 2022, police executed search warrants at two locations in Ohio. During the execution of the search warrants, officers encountered and arrested Wall, the intended recipient of the intercepted package. Police found “large quantities” of fentanyl pills, heroin, and methamphetamine during the searches.</p>

<p>In April 2021, a family member of the woman called and texted Berkett’s father about Berkett.</p>
<p>Later, Berkett’s found a purported murder-for-hire site on the darkweb. He hired a hitman for $13,000 to kill the “victim.” In the order description, Berkett wrote that he wanted the hit to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“look like an accident, but robbery gone wrong may work better. So long as she is dead. I’d also like for her phone to be retrieved and destroyed irreparably in the process. I would like proof of her death sent to me. She has a distinctive tattoo on one of her forearms that I know the image of, so a photo of her corpse and a photo of her tattoo for identification would work. I’ll refrain from sending a picture of the tattoo to avoid doctored photos. If possible, letting me know if she was in Arizona or Idaho wuld also be appreciated so I can also verify via the obituaries.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A media organization investigating murder-for-hire sites on the darkweb later contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation about Berkett’s hit. The media organization had identified the woman as the intended victim through the information Berkett had provided the administrator of the site, including “the identity and location of Victim 1, as well as social media accounts, nicknames, email, and a distinctive tattoo of Victim 1.”</p>
<p>Using blockchain analysis software, investigators identified Coinbase as the source of the $13,000 payment. Coinbase records identified Berkett as the owner of the account in question.</p>
<p>The FBI contacted the woman about the hit and Berkett. She told the FBI that she had flown to Los Angeles, where she had slept with the defendant. She described his behavior as “sexually aggressive.” After she left L.A., she stopped responding to Berkett’s messages. She complained that Berkett had attempted to contact her on “multiple social media and communications platforms” to get a response.</p>
<p>Posing as the hitman Berkett had hired on the darkweb, an undercover employee of the FBI contacted Berkett over WhatsApp. Berkett repeatedly incriminated himself in the conversations with the undercover fed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>UC</strong>: “Hi. You got the pictures?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Berkett</strong>: “Yup.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>UC</strong>: “Yeah. So, I’m following up on uh, something that was started a little while ago. Um. I’m just making contact with you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Berkett</strong>: “Okay. I was actually surprised to get, get that through WhatsApp.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>UC</strong>: “I know. We switch things up every once in a while. We’ll pick another one after this.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Berkett</strong>: “Okay, sounds good. Yeah, it seems to be the person. Uh, can’t recognize them about, can’t recognize them as well because of the graininess but, yeah that looks, that looks like them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>UC</strong>: “That’s, that’s her, right?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Berkett</strong>: “Yeah, that’s her.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[…]</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>UC</strong>: “Confirming that’s the person that we talked about on the uh, on the other piece, right?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Berkett</strong>: “Yeah.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>UC</strong>: “Okay. And you’ve already made, you’re already made the uh, the uh… the B payment, right?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Berkett</strong>: “Yeah, I’ve already done that.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>UC</strong>: “Okay, good.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Berkett</strong>: “That was confirmed by uh… yeah.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[…]</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>UC</strong>: “Good. Alright, so my understanding is what has to get done is this has to get done, uh we’re looking at some kind of accident or robbery to have gone wrong, right?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Berkett</strong>: “Yeah.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>UC</strong>: “Okay.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Berkett</strong>: “That way it doesn’t get traced.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>UC</strong>: “Right, and then we need to work on making sure your alibi is good. Um, and then we need some, you want some kind of proof, and there’s, if I’m, if I’m getting the information right, it’s some kind of phone that needs to be taken care of as well, right?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Berkett</strong>: “Yeah.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>UC</strong>: “Okay.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Berkett</strong>: “Uh, proof of the uh tattoo on her, one of her forearms.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>UC</strong>: “Okay. Do you want, is there, do you want that tattoo? Is that part of this?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Berkett</strong>: “Just need a picture of it to verify.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>UC</strong>: “Okay, do you, do you want it? Do you, is that, <strong>what kind of souvenir do you need, or do you need one</strong>?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Berkett</strong>: “<strong>Uh, just the photo…</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>UC</strong>: “<strong>Just the photo.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Berkett</strong>: “<strong>…of the tattoo</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>UC</strong>: “Okay, so”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Berkett</strong>: “It’s distinctive enough that I don’t need a souvenir.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>United States District Judge Mark C. Scarsi scheduled a sentencing hearing for September 12, 2022. Berkett faces a maximum sentence of ten years in prison.</p>
