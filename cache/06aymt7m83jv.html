<u>The nuclear deal</u> negotiated by President Barack Obama and Iran in 2015 was based on a simple premise: In exchange for lifting economic sanctions, Iran’s nuclear energy program would be put under strict international surveillance. The deal made sense for both sides. Iran would get sanctions relief and the chance to integrate itself in the global economy, and the United States would get an off-ramp to avoid yet another costly war in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The agreement never really got a chance to take hold, however, because the U.S. broke its word. In a <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2018/05/11/is-trump-trying-to-start-a-war-with-iran/">fit of personal pique at his predecessor</a> — and with the encouragement of Israel and the Gulf Arab states — President Donald Trump <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2018/05/08/donald-trump-iran-nuclear-deal-john-bolton/">violated the accord</a> by unilaterally reimposing sanctions and waging a “maximum pressure” campaign aimed at collapsing the Iranian economy.</p>
<p>The deal has been on life support ever since.</p>

<p>Now, the Iranians may be ready to pull the plug on this sick patient. This week, Iran informed the International Atomic Energy Agency that it would be removing 27 cameras that monitor nuclear sites — cameras that were installed as part of the 2015 agreement. This move was described by IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi as a “fatal blow” to the agreement, in a statement that also called on both sides to return to the deal.</p>
<p>Grossi is right that the nuclear deal may now be in its final days. But it would be wrong to attribute its death to this final step — which comes only after years of overt violations by the United States.</p>

<p>The U.S. and Iran now appear to be on a glide path to a conflict that no one wanted and that diplomats spent years of negotiations trying to avoid. When the deal was signed in 2015, it seemed these efforts had borne fruit. The successful push by <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/05/16/will-john-bolton-finally-get-his-war-with-iran/">hawks aiming to kill the agreement</a> has now brought things to a breaking point. The original motive of the nuclear deal was to <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/06/20/iran-crisis-have-we-learned-nothing-from-the-iraq-war/">avoid a war</a> over this issue that was already looming a decade ago. With no deal, we might again be <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/12/07/iran-war-nuclear-weapons-biden-trump">hurtling toward</a> exactly that war.</p>
<p><u>Under Trump,</u> the Iranian government continued to partially comply with the nuclear deal in the hopes of reviving it if a Democratic administration came back into power. President Joe Biden did win the White House in 2020, but instead of going back to the deal, he has chosen to maintain the sanctions that Trump imposed — the very measures the nuclear deal was intended to lift.</p>
<p>The sanctions <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/03/17/coronavirus-iran-sanctions/">devastated the Iranian economy</a> and drove millions of middle-class Iranians into poverty. If they are lifted in future — doubtful, at this point — it is still unlikely that Iran would ever get the investment from Western companies that it hoped to receive following the original deal. It’s clear now that U.S. sanctions on Iran could be reimposed with any shifting political winds in the U.S. That is a situation which makes it virtually impossible for foreign enterprises to invest there.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[3] -->
<p>The Iranian side lost much when the deal was torpedoed. Now the international community is going to take a possible hit to its aim of stopping nuclear proliferation. The removal of some of the surveillance cameras at nuclear sites means that the world is moving closer to the murky status quo ante that existed before the 2015 nuclear deal.</p>
<p>Although Iran has not said it would build a bomb, whatever nuclear activities that it conducts now will be done with drastically diminished international oversight. The IAEA, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, has already said that it <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/06/politics/iaea-iran-nuclear-warning/index.html">believes</a> that Iran is only “weeks away” from having a significant enough quantity of enriched uranium to put them within reach of a bomb. The loss of their surveillance capacity now means Iran could cross that threshold without them even knowing.</p>
<p>“Today, the IAEA is ‘flying blind’ about the details of Iran’s activities because it is unable to retrieve surveillance data being stored on the agency’s cameras as a consequence of U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal in 2018,” said John Tierney, executive director of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation in a press release about the news of the camera removals. “These new steps mean the IAEA is losing more data every day and it will be harder to trace every aspect of Iran’s nuclear program should negotiators find a diplomatic off-ramp to escalation. Once again, the United States, and the world, are better off with the limitations on Iran’s nuclear program than without them.”</p>
<p><u>At first blush,</u> it might make sense to blame Iran for the rapidly closing window of a revived nuclear deal. Yet to do so ignores the history of the deal and absolves the U.S. of its actions: Why should Iran be expected to continue its compliance during talks over a new deal while the U.S. has not taken any steps toward restoring its own compliance?</p>
<!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[4](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A1%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="1"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[4] -->
<p>The removal of the cameras is another sign of the failures of Washington’s posture toward Iran. The Trump administration bet that it could simply strong-arm Iran into sacrificing its nuclear program without offering sanctions relief or any other concessions in return.</p>
<p>Even though Trump did not want to suffer the consequences of a full-scale conflict with Iran, his withdrawal from the deal has set up for exactly that outcome: The U.S. will continue to reap what Trump sowed. Although Biden served as vice president in an administration that had made the nuclear deal a diplomatic centerpiece, he has been unwilling to return to compliance in a manner that <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/04/21/iran-nuclear-deal-biden-irgc/">might salvage the agreement</a>.</p>
<p>With nuclear monitoring now curtailed, the same hawks that have long pushed for attacking Iran’s nuclear program <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/12/17/iran-hawks-military-pressure-biden/">will continue to do so</a>. Although Iran has little hope of coming out victorious in a direct confrontation with the U.S. and its allies, it has advanced ballistic missile capacity as well as proxies on standby in many countries. A war with Iran would mean casualties and suffering for the U.S. and its allies unlike any of the wars with nonstate actors that America has fought in the two decades since 9/11.</p>

<p>A new war in the Middle East is simply not worth it from the perspective of U.S. interests. The best-case scenario is a signed agreement that controlled Iran’s nuclear program, while giving the Iranians a piece of the global economic pie that would be theirs to lose. Obama himself calculated that such an outcome made the most sense for all involved. Due to the structural inability of the U.S. government, including the Biden administration, to stick to its signed diplomatic agreements, the war that Obama tried to avoid may yet break out.</p>
<p>The deal to avert confrontation was already in hand. We should remember, as costs of the conflict mount, that it was the U.S. that blew up the off-ramp.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>In the midst</u> of the humanitarian disaster triggered by the Biden administration’s decision to seize Afghanistan’s $7 billion in banking reserves, an unlikely coalition of family members of 9/11 victims, Afghan diaspora organizations, and diplomats appointed by the former Afghan government are calling for the U.S. government to take urgent steps to help the Afghan economy. Meanwhile, the largest beneficiaries of President Joe Biden&#8217;s action are <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/02/16/afghanistan-funds-biden-september-11-lawyers-lobbyists/">likely to be lawyers</a> rather than 9/11 victims.</p>
<p>Releasing some of the funds to the Afghan central bank, those calling on the administration argue, would be a means of mitigating the catastrophe now playing out. Though billions of Afghan reserves are now earmarked for the potential benefit of a group of 9/11 victim families who had previously filed lawsuits against the Taliban, other families say that confiscating the savings of ordinary Afghans would be an inappropriate way of obtaining justice for their loved ones.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>In an executive order issued in February, Biden <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/02/11/afghanistan-frozen-assets-economy/">ordered</a> half of Afghanistan’s $7 billion in banking reserves to be set aside for some future undetermined use on behalf of the Afghan people, while ordering the other half to be used to settle lawsuits previously leveled by victims of 9/11 against the Taliban. The confiscation of these funds has meant that ordinary Afghans, already reeling from the collapse of the former government, are now facing a liquidity shock that has left many unable to withdraw cash or perform even basic financial transactions.</p>
<p>The impact of all this has devastated the country, already one of the poorest on Earth. The United Nations now estimates that roughly half of Afghans are currently facing acute hunger. Afghanistan’s fledgling middle class, many of whom were reliant on salaries tied to foreign aid agencies to survive, is being driven into dire poverty. A report compiled by a group of aid agencies estimates that as many as 120,000 Afghan children may have been married off to suitors for financial reasons by families desperate to survive.</p>

<p>Kelly Campbell, co-founder of the organization 9/11 Families for Peaceful Tomorrows, recently led a delegation to Afghanistan to observe conditions in the country following the collapse of the government. As she described it, the impact of the economic crisis there was palpable, with the drying up of cash in the economy a major cause of the suffering.</p>
<p>“There are people waiting in bread lines and very poor children with malnutrition visible in public, but there are also many middle-class people rapidly falling into poverty. This is being driven in part because there’s no longer a functioning banking system and people are unable to access their salaries. It’s a problem that humanitarian aid alone is not going to be able to solve,” said Campbell. “The fact of the matter is that these reserves are the Afghan people’s money. The idea that they are on the brink of famine and that we would be holding on to their money for any purpose is just wrong. The Afghan people are not responsible for 9/11, they’re victims of 9/11 the same way our families are. To take their money and watch them literally starve — I can’t think of anything more sad.”</p>

<p>The controversy over releasing the central bank reserves stems largely from concerns that the Taliban will use them to solidify their hold on the country. However, even officials who served under the former Afghan government say that the funds should be released as the property of the central bank, which is considered an independent entity from the governing regime in the country. The Taliban are not recognized today by the U.N. or any other country as the official government of Afghanistan, and Afghanistan continues to be represented at the U.N. by a diplomat, Naseer Ahmad Faiq, who was originally appointed by the prior regime. Faiq is now among those calling for the funds to be released to the central bank.</p>
<p>Faiq said that he supports compensation for 9/11 victims and that the international community should continue taking a tough line against the Taliban. But the freezing and confiscation of money owned by the Afghan central bank — and, by extension, ordinary Afghans — has simply compounded the injustice that has already taken place.</p>
<p>“The families and victims of 9/11 deserve sympathy and compensation. We share their agony, and of course they deserve justice. But the people of Afghanistan are also victims of terrorism. For the past 20 years they have been suffering the consequences of the war on terror,” Faiq said. “I am not fighting on behalf of the Taliban or their benefit, I’m representing the Afghan people. No Afghan was involved in the 9/11 attacks, and if their money remains frozen, especially at a time when they are suffering from war, poverty, and drought, it will worsen their conditions. The financial resources of ordinary Afghan citizens do not belong to the Taliban.”</p>
<h2>Fighting for Legal Fees</h2>
<p>The prospect of a financial windfall from the seized Afghan banking reserves has already set up <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/02/16/afghanistan-funds-biden-september-11-lawyers-lobbyists/">battles between law firms and lobbyists</a> claiming to represent different groups of plaintiffs affected by the attacks. The lawyers themselves involved in the cases stand to reap hundreds of millions of dollars in fees alone, amounting to upward of $525 million according to a conservative fee structure of 15 percent. Faced with the prospect of such a staggering payday, many lawyers involved have seemingly overcome any sympathy they might have felt for ordinary Afghans suffering from famine. Andrew Maloney, a partner at Kreindler &amp; Kreindler, one of the law firms now intervening to be included in a lawsuit that stands to benefit from the dispersal of funds, told his clients in a call <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/02/16/afghanistan-funds-biden-september-11-lawyers-lobbyists/">reported</a> by The Intercept, “The reality is, the Afghan people didn’t stand up to the Taliban. … They bear some responsibility for the condition they’re in.”</p>
<p>The spectacle of lawyers and lobbyists fighting over Afghanistan’s meager financial assets while the country is wracked by a devastating famine has angered many Afghan diaspora groups. Arash Azizzada, co-founder of the advocacy group Afghans for a Better Tomorrow, says that his organization has been calling for the Biden administration to act pragmatically to staunch the humanitarian crisis by releasing funds in small tranches — a measure that would give ordinary Afghans access to their bank accounts while allowing ongoing monitoring to make sure that money is not appropriated by the Taliban. The administration has not responded publicly to this proposal, even as the crisis continues and legal efforts to obtain some of the funds heat up.</p>

<p>“It is such a deep miscarriage of justice to cut a diplomatic deal to withdraw from Afghanistan in order to save American lives, and then seize the money of ordinary Afghan citizens on the way out,” Azizzada said. “Afghans are no strangers to injustice, but this is a particularly egregious act of misplaced violence. The people who made up Afghanistan’s middle class not long ago are now on the streets trying to sell vegetables to survive.”</p>
<p>A group of 47 victims of 9/11 known as the Havlish plaintiffs, who were awarded a court judgement in 2006, presently stand to benefit from the money frozen by the Biden administration from the Afghan reserves, though the number of those awarded could increase if other lawyers and lobbyists succeed in efforts to lay claim to the funds for clients.</p>
<p>Aidan Salamone’s father was killed in the 9/11 attacks when he was 4 years old. Though he supports the principle that 9/11 victims should be compensated, he says that the actions now being undertaken to freeze Afghanistan’s funds two decades after the attacks go against the spirit of the original lawsuits. He is now among those calling for the administration to act quickly to unfreeze the funds for the benefit of Afghan civilians.</p>
<p>“I think the Biden administration should have moved months ago to make sure that the entire $7 billion in funds were made available for the Afghan central bank to deal with the crisis there. September 11 families know very well what it’s like to have your life rocked by atrocity,” said Salamone. “To think that these lawsuits are actively contributing to other people suffering through famine-like conditions is really hard to stomach.”</p>

<p><u>As parents waited</u> in anguish for news about their children following the school massacre in Uvalde, Texas, they received a chilling request from police. Officers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/25/us/texas-shooting-parents-dna-victims.html">asked for DNA samples</a> from parents to help establish the identities of the children who had been killed in the massacre, the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history.</p>
<p>The request pointed to the obvious, horrifying conclusion that many of the children who had been killed were so grievously injured that it was likely impossible to identify their bodies.</p>
<p>How we got here should be obvious: the AR-15 rifle.</p>
<p>Much has been made of how easily the killer, Salvador Ramos, strode into a store and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/25/us/uvalde-texas-school-shooting-salvador-ramos/index.html">bought two AR-15s</a> the week before the attack, an apparent birthday gift to himself. Anyone paying attention gets that the ease of purchase for such weapons — which are frequently used in mass killings — is an indication of how deep the gun problem in America runs.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->
<p>It cannot be emphasized enough, however, exactly what the AR-15 is: It is a weapon of war. It was made to blow humans apart. It is successful in doing just that. The requests for DNA tests in Uvalde stand as a testament to the gun’s success, but the conclusion that the weapon excelled at blowing people apart was well documented by the U.S. military itself during early field tests.</p>
<p>During the Vietnam War, the U.S. conducted a survey into the impact of the AR-15 and its use on the battlefield. To put it bluntly, the survey found that the weapon, chambered with same .223 caliber rounds that Ramos used in Uvalde, was exceedingly good at killing human beings.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[2](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[2] -->
<p>A copy of the survey, which was published in a <a href="https://www.gawker.com/the-ar-15-was-built-for-slaughter-in-war-zones-1781891338">Gawker story</a> by my now-colleague Sam Biddle in 2016, shows that Viet Cong fighters hit with the weapon were frequently decapitated and dismembered, many looking as though they had “exploded.” A field report documented how an AR-15 had blown up a man’s head and turned another’s torso into “one big hole.” The weapon was lauded by soldiers on the battlefield for its effectiveness at killing adversaries and even cutting through dense jungle forest.</p>
<p>Some of the reports on Viet Cong soldiers killed with the weapon read like a matter-of-fact recounting from a horror film: “Chest wound from right to left, destroyed the thoracic cavity,” said the description of one AR-15-inflicted wound. “Stomach wound, which caused the abdominal cavity to explode,” said another.</p>
<p>Though it has become available domestically in the years since, the weapon was made for war — no matter what the National Rifle Association <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NRA/photos/a.1545417045476321/5456996464318340/?type=3&amp;p=30">says</a> — and was noted even at the time as being a significant escalation in the lethality of rifles.</p>
<p><u>It is hard</u> to comprehend a weapon like this being used against small children in an elementary school. The impact of the AR-15, a tool designed not just for killing but for ripping apart adult human bodies in the most extreme manner, being turned on the small, delicate limbs and organs of young children does not need to be imagined. The parents waiting outside the school in Uvalde for news of their loved ones who were asked for DNA tests were being clued into something horrifying about the types of weapons floating around American society, so easily available that even a disturbed 18-year-old could get his hands on them.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A4%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="4"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[3] -->
<p>In the aftermath of mass shootings targeting children, it is sometimes suggested that the public should be allowed to see the bodies. The impact of seeing actual flesh-and-blood children killed by assault rifles might shake the sensibilities of Americans enough that they enact serious changes to gun control laws that would make it less likely that AR-15s would be used again for such massacres.</p>
<p>Public aside, however, the reality is that the government has known for a long time what these weapons do. It has been sending AR-15s to wars abroad for decades and has documented in graphic detail the exploded and mangled corpses left behind. That such knowledge exists, and yet AR-15s are still commercially available for use by civilians in this country, tells you all you need to know about what pro-gun politicians are willing to tolerate.</p>
<p>The horrifying reality, which we all know, is that there will be another Uvalde sooner or later. The AR-15 is a demon that was unleashed on foreigners during wartime and has now returned as a demon to victimize innocent Americans, including the most innocent among us. A machine designed for the mass killing and maiming of other people — a design that had nothing to do with hunting or sportsmanship — should not be on American streets. At the minimum, no one in public life should be allowed to deny what it really does.</p>

<p><u>Before he walked</u> into the Tops Friendly Market in Buffalo, New York, on a mission to murder as many innocent Black shoppers as he could, 18-year-old Payton Gendron posted a rambling manifesto online outlining his motives.</p>
<p>His reasoning was familiar from other far-right <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/two-mass-murders-a-world-apart-share-a-common-theme-ecofascism/2019/08/18/0079a676-bec4-11e9-b873-63ace636af08_story.html">shooters</a>: This country isn’t going to be resource-rich enough for everyone in the future, so a race war over what is left is necessary today. However heinous, this vision of a bleak, impoverished future, in which there is not enough wealth to go around and the environment is near collapse, is motivating an ever-growing number of young men like him to carry out racist massacres across the West.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[1] -->Addressing this violence requires considering the role of scarcity — not a conspiracy theory, but a very real system of extreme inequality and ecological destruction.<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[1] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[1] -->
<p>People who commit acts of terrorism tend to act for more than one reason. The racist hatred of Gendron toward Black Americans, Jews, and immigrants was ultimately what made his murders possible. For that, many are to blame, including far-right politicians and talking heads who have continued to wink at the &#8220;great replacement&#8221; as being the true source of white Westerners’ troubles.</p>
<p>Addressing this violence, though, also requires considering the role of scarcity — not a conspiracy theory, but a very real system of extreme inequality and ecological destruction. It is a system in which the most wealthy and powerful continue to see their wealth and power grow — at the expense of the masses. Faced with actual strained resources and environmental calamity, some of these forsaken people are turning to dark fantasies like the &#8220;great replacement theory&#8221; to make sense of it all.</p>
<p>This is not just about a toxic media ecosystem, but the larger way we have organized our lives in the West. This organizational structure could go by many names — neoliberalism, consumer capitalism, exploitation — but there can be little doubt that the pessimism it engenders is leading many young people into nihilism.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[2](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[2] -->
<p>Faced with a shrinking economic pie and disastrous climate situation, many young people are now convinced that the world they become adults in will be poorer, more polluted, and less hopeful than that enjoyed by their parents and grandparents. It should not be surprising, then, that the appeal of apocalyptic ideologies is taking hold. The problems of economics and the environment are real, but the scapegoating is where the conspiracies come in: It doesn’t take much to convince those already gloomy about their futures that the real culprits are immigrants and minorities.</p>
<p>That Gendron is a racist barely needs stating. His manifesto shows no concern for the humanity of nonwhite people, describing them as a pestilence to be eradicated from Western countries. He even advocates killing nonwhite children, arguing that if they are allowed to live, they will simply spawn more “replacers” — a nod to the &#8220;great replacement theory&#8221; of demographic change promoted by other far-right shooters, which claims that white people are being inflicted with a “genocide” caused by low birthrates and immigration.</p>
<p>If there is a major theme besides racism that runs through Gendron’s manifesto, it is simple pessimism about the future. In his writings, he concluded that the future of the U.S. will be one of economic decay and environmental collapse. With such a dire perspective, along with a belief that other races and ethnic groups are both inferior to white people and their natural enemies, his actions followed naturally from his worldview.</p>
<p>We should all be disturbed that he is clearly not alone in believing what he does.</p>

<p><u>People who would</u> never dream of carrying out such a crime — and who have no sense of hatred for other races — feel similarly bleak about the future. A recent <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/economic-pessimism-is-on-the-rise-among-many-youths">study</a> by UNICEF found that a majority of 15- to 24-year-olds in high-income countries had concluded that with wage stagnation, they will be worse off economically than their parents were.</p>
<p>It’s not that there aren’t enough resources to go around in the U.S., but it feels that way to many when a relatively small number of people have been hoarding the wealth. At this point, it’s almost cliché to point out that in the U.S. the 1st percentile of earners have seen their <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/dfa/distribute/chart/#quarter:119;series:Assets;demographic:networth;population:all;units:levels;range:2005.2,2020.2">wealth explode over the past several decades</a>, while that of the bottom 50 percent of the country has remained completely stagnant.</p>
<p>Then there’s the alarming state of the natural environment. The total failure of political elites and the wealthy to combat the climate crisis is fueling despair among the young about whether they will even have a future at all. Although environmentalism is usually associated with the left today, <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/environment-climate-eugenics-immigration/">the right has a long history</a> of using concerns about ecological destruction as a recruiting tool. The politics of fear could easily leverage this as a major issue again, making it into a mass appeal to the disaffected; in the mass shooters, we are already seeing it happen on the fringes.</p>

<p>A recent <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-58549373">global survey</a> found that over three-quarters of young people felt that the future would be frightening because of climate change, while fully 56 percent said that they thought humanity was “doomed.” The conviction that our political choices have doomed us to a future apocalypse is leading to a <a href="https://www.nationalobserver.com/2020/12/02/eco-anxiety-youth-mental-health-climate-change">mental health crisis</a> among young people in the U.S. and beyond.</p>
<p>At the same time, even liberal politicians who pay lip service to the issue seem unwilling or unable to do anything to deliver a plausible picture of a better environmental future. In his manifesto, Gendron went on about the “continued destruction of the natural environment” while concluding that racist murder was an acceptable way to help stop it.</p>
<p>If we really want to see fewer tragedies like the racist murders in Buffalo, we need to combat the nihilism at the core of the shooter’s worldview. Fighting racism itself is going to be a part of that effort. If wealth was not so concentrated, however, or if politicians acted as though the climate crisis really mattered, there would be a smaller reservoir of nihilistic youths for right-wing extremists to recruit from in the first place.</p>
<p>The people with power in the U.S. today — whose wealth has skyrocketed even as their fellow citizens’ prospects darken — have the power to do a lot to change that mindset. An end to the class warfare that has enriched the wealthiest sliver of Americans while the rest suffer the ravages of stagnant wages, addiction, and family breakdown would be a good start. If the outlook for the future for young people doesn’t get brighter, with more wealth to share and a climate capable of supporting life, we are going to see many more acts of mass murder in the future — accompanied by the release of pitiful, imitative manifestos like that Gendron posted before wasting his life to take others’.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Controversy erupted</u> this week over a young Palestinian activist&#8217;s invitation to speak at Georgetown Law School. In advance of the event, the Anti-Defamation League, or ADL, accused 23-year-old Palestinian writer Mohammed El-Kurd of being antisemitic — an allegation that was echoed by <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/georgetown-law-scheduled-to-host-an-anti-semite-who-claims-israelis-harvest-organs-of-the-martyred/">conservative</a> media outlets. Though the event on Tuesday went ahead as planned, Georgetown has come under pressure in the media, as well as from some students and faculty, to condemn El-Kurd and disavow the event.</p>
<p>The war of words began a few days before the Georgetown event, when Jonathan Greenblatt, the liberal head of the ADL, shared a <a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounders/mohammed-el-kurd">dossier</a> accusing El-Kurd of antisemitism based on a selection of his tweets and past writing. Most of the accusations were based on social media posts from El-Kurd loudly chastising Israel and Zionism.</p>
<p>One item from the ADL dossier, however, has become the centerpiece of the campaign against the writer: a line from a poem he wrote that is now being alleged to echo a medieval antisemitic trope known as the “blood libel,” an accusation originated in medieval Europe that Jews consumed the blood of non-Jews for ritual purposes.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>The passage in question came from El-Kurd’s book of poetry published last year, “Rifqa.” In one of the poems, El-Kurd, who denies the charges of antisemitism, wrote, “They harvest organs of the martyred, feed their warriors our own.”</p>
<p>The line includes one of the few footnotes in the volume of poetry, directing the reader to a decade-old <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna34503294">news story</a> in which the Israeli government admitted to harvesting organs from bodies of Palestinians, as well as some Israelis, without their families&#8217; consent in the 1990s.</p>
<p>El-Kurd denied that the line from the poem had anything to do with the “blood libel” trope, saying in an interview that until very recently he had not been familiar with it. “When I wrote this poem, I was like 14 or 15 years old,” El-Kurd said. “I literally only understood what blood libel was like two months ago. I’d never in my life even heard of this concept.”</p>
<p>The allegation of antisemitism against El-Kurd based on the poem is the only one that has gained traction. That his accusers are relying on a relatively obscure accusation — a distant echo of an antisemitic trope from the European Middle Ages — as the main ammunition against El-Kurd is raising questions among advocates for Palestinian rights about the responsibilities of Israel’s critics to have an almost-scholarly grasp of antisemitism and its history.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[1] -->
<p>“I’m far more familiar with the history of antisemitism and the history of prejudice against Jewish people than I am about the history of prejudices against many, many other peoples because that is what is necessary to engage on this subject in the United States,” said Yousef Munayyer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Arab Center Washington. “At the same time, people who make arguments in favor of Israeli policies never seem to be subjected to the same minefield related to sensitivities over Palestinian history and suffering. That clear double standard is one the ADL seems dedicated to reinforcing.&#8221;</p>
<p>El-Kurd said he was unfazed by the flap over his language. “I’m not scared of the ADL or its predictable, racist smear campaigns,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It has no moral authority over me or any advocate of Palestinian liberation. I will not negotiate my vocabulary, let alone my character, with defenders of Zionism, colonialism, and apartheid. One look at the organization’s shameful history is enough to strip it of any legitimacy its deceptive name might offer it.”</p>
<p><u>An email obtained</u> by The Intercept, signed by a group of Jewish students and faculty members at Georgetown, and addressed to the school administration, called for the school to condemn El-Kurd’s presence at the Tuesday event. The letter stated that his writing had used “a foul antisemitic trope, originating in the Middle Ages, that claims that Jews use the blood of gentiles for ritual or culinary purposes.”</p>
<p>The critical letter was followed by a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21777828-alumni-letter-to-georgetown-law-school-in-support-of-mohammed-el-kurd">statement supporting El-Kurd</a> from a group of Georgetown Law alumni led by Palestinian American legal scholar Noura Erakat. El-Kurd’s supporters reviewed the blood libel accusation in the poem and rejected the charge, stating that “the literal interpretation of what is clearly figurative speech appears to be done in bad faith.”</p>
<p>The letter of support also argued that the controversy over the poem was changing the subject: discussions about Palestinians&#8217; actual living conditions in the Occupied Territories were being supplanted by debates over wording. “The cause of Palestinian liberation is buried under bad faith interpretations of El-Kurd’s poetry. A single metaphorical line, subject to interpretation, becomes prioritized over the vile condition of Palestinian unfreedom,” it said.</p>
<p>El-Kurd told The Intercept that his poem was referring to the documented historical event in Israel-Palestine cited in the footnotes. He also said that as a teenager learning to write poetry, his teachers had encouraged him to use metaphorical language.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[2](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A1%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="1"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[2] -->
<p>“It’s a metaphor, it’s not something I literally believe. I’m just now realizing that they actually think, or are pretending to think for purposes of exaggeration, that I actually believe Israelis eat Palestinian organs. At first it was comical, but now it seems very sinister,” El-Kurd said. “The line is about the practice of withholding Palestinian bodies and using them as bargaining chips and in the past, exploiting the bodies in ways that have been documented and are widely discussed. It’s not a conspiracy theory.”</p>
<p>He added, “At the time I wrote it, I was writing more literally about the practice of withholding bodies, but my teachers told me to make it more abstract and to use artistic language.”</p>
<p>El-Kurd said that the ADL never reached out or attempted to engage him about concerns that the group had with his writing. (The ADL did not respond to a request for comment.) Instead, with the dossier and the campaign to get his event at Georgetown canceled, the ADL has focused on trying to push him out of the public debate on Israel-Palestine entirely.</p>
<p><u>There’s no denying</u> that El-Kurd grew up angry. A young Palestinian from the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah, he has spent his entire life fighting against the Israeli government’s attempt to evict him and his neighbors from their homes.</p>
<p>When he was 11 years old, a group of hard-line Israeli settlers, including some with origins in the U.S., moved into a portion of his family home and tossed his family’s possessions into the street. The settlers have remained there ever since. To this day, they are pushing to evict his family entirely. His involvement on Israel-Palestine issues has been forced by circumstances that have shaped his life since childhood.</p>
<p>People who have worked in advocacy on Israel-Palestine also point out that it&#8217;s unreasonable to expect a 23-year-old to know how to navigate sophisticated speech codes around the conflict in the United States, or to immediately tar them as antisemites if they don’t.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[3] -->“There are elaborate and ever-shifting speech codes that are constantly retrofitted to try and equate any form of Palestinian criticism of Zionism with antisemitism.&#8221;<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[3] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[3] -->
<p>“There are elaborate and ever-shifting speech codes that are constantly retrofitted to try and equate any form of Palestinian criticism of Zionism with antisemitism,” Munayyer said. “Those of us who operate in the American debate around this issue are forced to be very aware of the many ways that one’s legitimate criticism of Zionism can be misconstrued in bad faith as antisemitic speech.”</p>
<p>The ADL dossier that triggered the uproar against El-Kurd does acknowledge that “the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is intensely personal for El-Kurd” and that his family has been “entangled in a long-standing political and property dispute that has left them under threat of eviction by Israel for years.”</p>
<p>Under Greenblatt’s leadership, the ADL has taken liberal stances on some issues. The group has even taken steps to make amends for some past controversies: In 2021, Greenblatt issued a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/04/opinions/park-51-anti-defamation-league-9-11-greenblatt/index.html">public apology</a> for the ADL’s decision to oppose the construction of a mosque in Lower Manhattan, saying on behalf of the organization, “We were wrong, plain and simple.” Greenblatt has also stridently called out Donald Trump and the far right, something for which he has been attacked by conservatives.</p>
<p>The controversy over El-Kurd may make it harder for even a rebranded ADL to make new allies. Many progressives today are sympathetic to Palestinian suffering, and the knee-jerk attempt to “cancel” El-Kurd, including with a coordinated media blitz, is unlikely to endear them to the ADL.</p>
<p>For his part, El-Kurd says that the attacks on him, which characterize his expressions of outrage as bigotry, paint a one-sided picture that doesn’t reflect the real-world violence that he and his family suffer at the hands of the Israeli settler movement and the government that supports it.</p>
<p>“My family is threatened by expulsion every day, and all I’ve ever known is life under Israeli occupation,” El-Kurd said. “All I’ve known is tear gas and beatings and police abuse.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>When Russian President</u> Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, he didn’t seek a democratic mandate. Russia has an authoritarian regime, in which one man and his lieutenants run the show. The diverse views of over 140 million citizens of the Russian Federation — spanning a huge number of ethnicities and languages, not to mention geography — mean little when it comes to foreign policy choices.</p>
<p>Yet when Russian tanks began rolling into Ukraine, the U.S. and its European allies turned to a familiar weapon, one that indiscriminately targets all Russian citizens rather than just those responsible for the crimes we are seeing today: broad-based economic sanctions.</p>
<p>In recent years, sanctions have become a favored tool of U.S. policymakers, used as a modern form of siege warfare but with lower domestic political costs than sending U.S. troops abroad. In addition to sanctions targeting oligarchs and the Russian high-tech and defense sectors, the U.S. and its allies have gone for the jugular by attempting to tank the entire Russian economy.</p>
<p>Russia is staying afloat for now, thanks to continuing sales of its natural gas reserves, but the stories of a handful of other countries hold a cautionary tale for the West about the potential human costs of sanctions to ordinary citizens.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>A public <a href="https://www.niacouncil.org/april-28-letter-global-sanctions-impact/">letter</a> from a coalition of advocacy groups today called on the Biden administration to revisit its use of economic sanctions and deliver on its promise to reform this area of foreign policymaking. The letter pointed to countries like Iran, Yemen, Afghanistan, and Venezuela that are suffering economic collapse and even famine under the pressure of sanctions and blockades by the U.S. and its allies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many policymakers view sanctions as a politically expedient alternative to war, but the fact is broad sanctions are economic warfare that punishes innocents,” said Jamal Abdi, president of the National Iranian American Council, one of the groups that spearheaded the letter. “The human costs suffered by the hundreds of millions of people under U.S. sanctions are an unacceptable collateral damage, and it&#8217;s past time for serious efforts to reform our sanctions regime.”</p>
<p>The letter was organized primarily by advocacy groups created by diaspora communities from countries where sanctions have impoverished the populations while doing little to change the undemocratic regimes they live under. Alongside the National Iranian American Council, the diaspora groups that signed the letter include Afghans for a Better Tomorrow, Oil for Venezuela, the Korea-focused group Women Cross DMZ, and the Yemen Relief and Reconstruction Foundation. Other foreign policy advocacy groups also added their names to the letter, including the Washington, D.C.-based Win Without War and the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[1] -->
<p>The advocacy groups&#8217; letter briefly outlines the impact of sanctions on civilians in a range of countries, while chastising President Joe Biden for only paying lip service to the problem of humanitarian crises caused in whole or in part by Western sanctions.</p>
<p>“We recognize that the Biden administration initiated a comprehensive review of U.S. sanctions policies last year, setting out a general goal of minimizing humanitarian impacts and supporting humanitarian trade to heavily-sanctioned jurisdictions,” the letter said. “However, this guidance has not been followed by concrete and comprehensive steps to deliver relief and open up humanitarian trade. As a result, the U.S. government has failed to significantly alter course and continues to enforce policies that fuel humanitarian and public health disasters.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration&#8217;s review of sanctions policy was <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/78785/the-biden-administrations-disappointing-sanctions-report-what-should-come-next/">heavily criticized</a> last year for failing to recommend any concrete policy proposals, let alone legislative changes, that would protect innocent civilians from being harmed by sanctions today or in the future.</p>
<p><u>Examples of the</u> harmful impacts of sanctions on civilians — and their failure to sway authoritarian leaders — are not hard to find.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, the U.S. imposed a crushing sanctions regime against Iraq following the war in Kuwait. The measures <a href="https://merip.org/2020/06/the-enduring-lessons-of-the-iraq-sanctions/">immiserated ordinary Iraqis</a> while allowing Saddam Hussein to further consolidate his grip on society. Today middle classes in places like Iran have fallen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/28/world/middleeast/iran-economy.html">into destitution</a> because of U.S. sanctions on the Iranian economy and central bank. In Afghanistan, following last year’s collapse of the central government, the U.S. not only cut off critical aid but also <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/11/fact-sheet-executive-order-to-preserve-certain-afghanistan-central-bank-assets-for-the-people-of-afghanistan/">confiscated its banking reserves</a>, leading to a liquidity crisis in the poorest country on Earth and ultimately to reports of starvation. Under a blockade led by U.S. allies, Yemen has similarly faced mass outbreaks of disease and malnutrition.</p>

<p>Sanctions reform is not a particularly popular subject. Oftentimes, as in the case of Russia today, countries subject to broad sanctions truly are unsavory or engaged in behavior that needs to be stopped.</p>
<p>The problem, though, is that untargeted sanctions that punish civilian populations have been a poor means of making foreign governments change their policies. While elites in sanctioned countries usually find a way to get what they need, ordinary people find themselves sent into poverty — victimized by economic blockades that U.S. politicians treat as open-ended.</p>

<p>Even in the case of Russia today, there is an argument to be made that lowering the sanctions pressure on ordinary Russians and <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/03/20/ukraine-russia-weapons-sanctions/">increasing arms supplies to Ukraine</a> would be both a more humanitarian and strategically effective way to end the war.</p>
<p>Calls for sanctions policy reform are likely to get more strident as the U.S. continues to escalate its use of this policy tool. While the Biden administration has engaged in some symbolic attempts at reform, millions of people who are not guilty of any crime against Americans continue to suffer around the world today from U.S. sanctions regimes.</p>
<p>“The United States must lead by example, overhaul U.S. sanctions, and ensure that sanctions are targeted, proportional, connected to discrete policy goals and reversible. This would necessarily result in an end to unjust collective punishment of civilian populations around the globe who have little control over governmental decision making,” the advocacy groups’ letter said. “Only by grappling with the full impact of sanctions can the U.S. ensure that sanctions don’t exacerbate the plight of ordinary citizens and serve, rather than undermine, U.S. interests.”</p>

<p><u>In a short</u> video <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-president-joe-biden-mocked-after-shaking-hands-with-thin-air-post-speech-2890406">clip</a> that went viral across the globe this week, President Joe Biden concluded a speech in North Carolina with a stirring call for unity among Americans. Then he turned away from the podium and appeared to reach into thin air for a handshake. The clip amused Biden’s many detractors, who allege that the U.S. president is suffering from cognitive decline, though <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/apr/19/facebook-posts/biden-was-gesturing-towards-his-audience-not-shaki/">others dispute</a> that interpretation of the video.</p>
<p>Whether or not it was a sign of his deteriorating mental acuity, the image of Biden seeming to shake hands with no one is an apt metaphor for his administration’s many diplomatic failures since coming to office. At the top of the list is Biden’s inability to achieve his basic aim of reentering the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. That&#8217;s where the handshake comes in: It looked as if Biden was pronouncing himself ready to enter into an agreement, but with no one on the other end. While there have been questions about the functioning of Biden’s brain following such incidents, what really may be plaguing the president is a lack of heart.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->
<p>In 2018, President Donald Trump exited the Iran nuclear agreement in a fit of pique aimed at undermining a key diplomatic achievement of President Barack Obama. Biden initially campaigned on a pledge to return to a deal that places Iran’s nuclear program under strict controls in exchange for sanctions relief.</p>
<p>It should have been an easy win, reversing a dangerous foreign policy decision made on a whim by Trump. However, more than a year into his presidency, Biden has utterly failed to find his way back into the deal. Instead of preserving one of the major diplomatic accomplishments of the Obama administration, in which he served as vice president, Biden is effectively siding with Trump’s position. The nuclear agreement is now on the brink of collapsing entirely — and the blame for it lies squarely with Biden.</p>
<p>The impasse in the current talks, according to reports, is an issue that Trump injected into the diplomatic mix exactly to prevent his successor from reviving the deal: the listing of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[2](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[2] -->
<p>The 2019 listing of the group by Trump was not directly tied to the nuclear deal — he had already abandoned the agreement — but it made the deal virtually impossible to revive.</p>
<p>The benefit that the nuclear deal was intended to provide Iran was foreign investment and trade to rescue the Islamic Republic’s flagging economy. For better or worse, the IRGC is a major economic player in Iran, and treating it as a terrorist organization makes it highly unlikely that Western companies will feel comfortable doing business in the country at all.</p>
<p>In other words, making the IRGC a terror group effectively blocks whatever gains Iran would hope to make from cutting a deal in the first place. Reviving the agreement becomes a nonstarter — just as Trump planned.</p>
<p><u>Iran has demanded</u> as part of the talks that the IRGC be removed from the terrorist list before reentering the deal. The Biden administration has refused, saying that if the group is to be removed, Iran will have to make additional concessions outside the nuclear deal, which is formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.</p>
<p>“If Iran wants sanctions-lifting that goes beyond the JCPOA, they’ll need to address concerns of ours that go beyond the JCPOA,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-iran-will-have-to-offer-reciprocity-if-it-wants-to-negotiate-status-of-irgc/">said</a>, when asked about the Revolutionary Guards’ possible delisting at a press conference Monday. “They will need to negotiate those issues in good faith with reciprocity.”</p>
<p>Price didn’t swear off delisting the IRGC, but in response to questions, he said that the United States “will use every appropriate tool to confront the IRGC’s destabilizing role in the region, including working closely with our partners in Israel.” Several U.S. allies in the region, including Israel and Saudi Arabia, are believed to be lobbying against a revived deal. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-satisfied-as-us-seems-likely-to-keep-irans-guards-on-terror-blacklist/">reportedly</a> hopes that the IRGC listing will be a “deal breaker” that prevents a return to the agreement.</p>

<p>Placing the IRGC on the terrorist list is mainly symbolic from the U.S. perspective. Iran is already designated as a state sponsor of terrorism, and the IRGC is subject to numerous sanctions that remain in effect regardless of whether it is specifically listed. The IRGC listing does, however, have <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/04/06/iran-terrorist-watchlist-travel-irgc/">serious repercussions</a> for ordinary Iranians and even dual nationals of Western countries who were raised in Iran. The IRGC operates on a conscription basis and draws recruits from across Iranian society.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of ordinary Iranians are now potentially on the U.S. terrorist watchlist and likely to remain there as a long as the organization they served in is considered a terror group by the U.S. In addition to the economic concerns around sanctions, Iran thus has a strong motivation for seeing the IRGC, which is ultimately a branch of its military, delisted as part of any broader agreement.</p>
<p>“As far as the Iranians are concerned, there is definitely an element of pride where they don’t want to have a major branch of their military listed as a terrorist organization,” said Hooman Majd, author of “<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/213686/the-ministry-of-guidance-invites-you-to-not-stay-by-hooman-majd/">The Ministry of Guidance Invites You to Not Stay</a>.” “Just as importantly, the JCPOA was also supposed to bring sanctions relief to Iran. That was not just relief in the sense that the Iranian central bank wouldn’t be sanctioned anymore; the deal was also specifically supposed to encourage foreign investment in Iran.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[4](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[4] -->“There is definitely an element of pride where they don’t want to have a major branch of their military listed as a terrorist organization.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[4] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[4] -->
<p>Majd was privy to discussions around the original JCPOA negotiation and believes that the Iranian government may walk away from a renewed agreement if it calculates that sanctions on the IRGC will prevent it from reaping the expected economic benefits.</p>
<p>“When other sanctions were placed on Iran in the 1990s, the IRGC became the de facto engineering arm of the Iranian government,” he said. “Everything down to the international airport in Tehran is run by the IRGC, and every aspect of business in Iran has some connection to the IRGC or former members of the IRGC. If the IRGC is listed as a terrorist organization, is Boeing going to sell them planes?”</p>
<p><u>The Iran nuclear</u> deal was intended as a last best shot at avoiding another major crisis in the Middle East. Given the Trump administration’s obvious violation of a deal that the U.S. had signed with the support of its allies, Biden could have easily reentered the agreement upon taking office.</p>
<p>Instead, the U.S. waffled. It now risks restarting a conflict that the Obama administration had expended significant diplomatic and political capital to avert. Most tragic will be the fact that it was easily avoidable.</p>
<p>Biden may not have been grasping at the air following his speech in North Carolina earlier this week. If he fails to bring the U.S. back into an agreement in line with its own signed commitments on the Iran nuclear deal, though, the image of him aimlessly searching for a hand to shake will be symbolic of his own presidency.</p>

<p><u>The outcome of</u> France’s upcoming presidential vote is gearing up to have a major impact on European security at a time when the continent finds itself back at war. The runoff vote, scheduled for April 24, pits the incumbent centrist President Emmanuel Macron against far-right challenger Marine Le Pen, whose National Rally party stands near the precipice of coming to power for the first time in its history.</p>
<p>Le Pen, well known for her <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2017/04/24/marine-le-pen-is-what-happens-when-you-try-to-meet-racism-in-the-middle/">unfavorable views on immigrants</a> and minorities in France, has made nativism a core campaign message. What may end up being even more consequential for the future of the entire continent, though, is Le Pen’s warm relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin: the man responsible for igniting the worst conflict in Europe since the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->
<p>Since Putin launched his brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine two months ago, France has been a stalwart member of the coalition against Russia. Under Macron, it has helped build the international sanctions regime against Russia and participated in supporting Ukraine’s defense through NATO. If Le Pen, whose hostility to the European Union and sympathy with Putin are a matter of public record, comes to office, those initiatives are likely to be rolled back.</p>
<p>The cozy ties between Le Pen and Putin have been nurtured even as the latter has emerged as a menace to European security. In 2017, Le Pen <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/24/europe/putin-le-pen-kremlin/index.html">visited</a> the Kremlin where she criticized EU sanctions on Russia following its annexation of the Ukrainian territory of Crimea, reportedly calling the measures “unfair and silly.” She later defended Putin to French media, claiming that the annexation was legal — a dubious assertion — and reflected the will of the people of the region. Le Pen has long argued for closer ties with Russia on ideological grounds. She even came under fire for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/a-russian-bank-gave-marine-le-pens-party-a-loan-then-weird-things-began-happening/2018/12/27/960c7906-d320-11e8-a275-81c671a50422_story.html">taking loans</a> from a politically connected Russia bank to fund her party’s political operations in France.</p>

<p>Given Le Pen’s past, there is little reason to think that she will hold back on realigning France away from multilateral European institutions and towards Russia. Such a move would arguably be the most consequential change in the European security system since the end of World War II and would happen at a moment when Europe finds itself more threatened than ever by a resurgent Russia.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22left%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-left" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="left"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[3] -->“I think that if Le Pen won, our national security would be put at stake.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[3] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[3] -->
<p>“I think that if Le Pen won, our national security would be put at stake,” said Rim-Sarah Alouane, a French legal scholar and a Ph.D. candidate in comparative law at Université Toulouse 1 Capitole. “France would find itself marginalized both inside Europe and around the world. Alliances with our allies would be weakened or broken, and we would find ourselves aligning instead with undemocratic countries with whom we should not be aligning.”</p>
<p>She went on, “Le Pen has an ideological fascination with Putin, as well as financial ties in Russia. She’s a Eurosceptic so France would naturally lose its position as one of the leaders of the EU. If she won, we should expect that France will pay a serious price in its foreign relations.”</p>
<p><u>It is one thing</u> for small eastern European states like Hungary or Serbia to be pro-Russia; for a major EU power like France to take such a position would be another matter entirely. Le Pen has been circumspect on specific actions, but if her expressed views guide her policies as president, France’s major alliances would be reordered under her leadership.</p>
<p>Like many other far-right leaders on the continent, Le Pen is hostile to the EU, describing it as a drag on France’s sovereignty. Le Pen has already signaled that she would take French troops out of NATO’s <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/france/20220413-le-pen-wants-france-out-of-nato-integrated-command-backs-nato-russia-links">integrated command</a> — where various national armies contribute to a force led by generals answering to the alliance. Though she has so far denied any intention to remove France entirely from NATO or the EU, observers say that Le Pen is merely biding her time until she controls the levers of power in Paris.</p>
<p>The skepticism of these major alliances is of a piece with her relationship to Russia. She has called for reconciliation between Europe and Putin, in stark contrast to other European leaders who have been galvanized in hostility toward Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. Le Pen has <a href="https://tass.com/politics/1419095?utm_source=google.com&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=google.com&amp;utm_referrer=google.com">pushed back</a> against calls to cut off purchases of Russian gas, warning that such a move would be suicidal for French businesses, even while other European countries have announced plans to phase out purchases from Russia in the coming years.</p>

<p>Her public comments have put her well at odds with other European leaders who have maintained a nearly united front against Russia’s aggression. At a time when the unity of EU countries has been challenged in a most dramatic fashion by the war, the opportunity to break off a key member of the European alliance against Russia would be a tremendous strategic win for Putin.</p>
<p>A win for Le Pen could be a boon to Russia’s geopolitical aims in other, more subtle ways. French society remains heavily polarized, along not just political but <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/12/12/macron-france-terrorism-islam/">ethnic lines</a>. Le Pen’s election would be certain to heighten those divisions. Those are the sorts of dynamics actors like Russia have frequently sought to exploit toward their own ends, namely weakening Western Europe. Le Pen’s victory could give Putin an opening by cleaving France along its societal fault lines.</p>

<p>For observers like Alouane, an explosion of internal turmoil in France could push the country into the sort of right-wing politics seen, for instance, in Hungary, where pro-Putin President Viktor Orban has used reactionary politics to help solidify his hold on power.</p>
<p>“If she wins, there will certainly be mass protests,” said Alouane, of Le Pen. “Implementing a state of emergency in France is not difficult at this stage, and there is a real possibility that following her election we could turn into a Viktor Orban-style illiberal state.”</p>
<p>While Macron still has a slight lead over Le Pen in head-to-head polls, his victory is far from assured. The French would do well to recognize that not just the future of France is at stake, but also the future of Europe.</p>

A wastewater management engineer based in Madison, Wisconsin, he had returned to Canada, where his wife and children lived, for a few weeks last October for a routine visit. Now, he was heading back to Wisconsin for work.</p>
<p>Travelers to the U.S. from the Calgary airport go through customs and passport control at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection checkpoint at their point of departure, in Canada, before boarding. Toghraei, 53, a Canadian citizen of Iranian background, had gone through this process many times before without incident.</p>
<p>He sat quietly in the room waiting alongside a handful of others who had been marked for secondary inspection. He assumed he had been flagged because of a computer glitch or some kind of random selection that would involve a few extra questions before traveling. When his name was called, Toghraei — short, soft-spoken, with glasses and a salt-and-pepper goatee — walked to the desk at the front of the room to speak with the agent.</p>
<p>After Toghraei confirmed his name and a few other details, the agent got to the point: “Where did you do your military service?”</p>
<p>He immediately became tense. “I’d never been asked such a thing before at a border crossing,” he later recalled. “When they asked me that question, I began to think that something must be seriously wrong.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22left%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-left" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="left"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[1] -->“I was just doing my mandatory military service as a young man and I didn’t have the freedom to choose.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[1] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[1] -->
<p>Young men in Iran, where Toghraei was born and raised before immigrating to Canada roughly two decades ago, must do a two-year period of mandatory military service. Toghraei was no exception. Conscripted in his early 20s, he was assigned to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, known in Iran as the Sepah. In the IRGC, Toghraei worked a desk job translating documents related to water management. Now, he was suddenly being asked about his decades-ago assignment by a U.S. government official. “When they asked me specifically what branch of the military,” Toghraei said, “I told them honestly that my unit was in the Sepah.”</p>
<p>In 2019, amid a campaign to raise pressure on the Iranian government, the Trump administration <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/04/08/netanyahu-thanks-trump-sanctioning-iran-request-eve-israeli-election/">officially labeled</a> the IRGC a terrorist organization. The designation was likely why Toghraei found himself being interrogated despite never facing trouble before.</p>
<p>A rotating group of customs agents pressed for more details about his IRGC service: what type of uniform he wore, who he worked with, and what type of training he received. Toghraei said he answered questions honestly: He translated documents and didn’t wear a uniform. Had he used weapons? Only for basic rifle training in the first few days of his service. “He even asked me things like the name of my boss in Iran and where my office was located,” Toghraei said. “I said honestly again that I couldn’t remember such things. This all happened decades ago. Even I had forgotten the details.”</p>
<p>The agents became frustrated with his answers. After a while, Toghraei said, their demeanor turned hostile.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(acast)[2](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22ACAST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Afalse%7D)(%7B%22id%22%3A%22long-after-leaving-iran-dual-nationals-now-labeled-terrorist%22%2C%22podcast%22%3A%22intercepted-with-jeremy-scahill%22%2C%22subscribe%22%3Atrue%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(acast)[2] -->
<p>Eventually, he missed his flight. “I was just doing my mandatory military service as a young man and I didn’t have the freedom to choose,” Toghraei recalled telling his interrogators. “I told them I had been to the U.S. many times throughout my life and never had any problem. Now I am 53 years old. So can you explain why this is suddenly happening to me?”</p>
<p>Four hours after he was first taken into secondary inspection, an agent broke the news to Toghraei: He had been deemed inadmissible to the United States. His temporary national visa, which had been approved seven months earlier, was stamped over: “CANCELLED.” Toghraei received no further information and, soon after, he was told to leave.</p>
<p>His short trip back to Canada to see his family ended with Toghraei banned from the U.S. He did not know how he would explain to his boss in Madison why he would not be returning to work, nor what he would do about the apartment, car, and personal belongings he had there. Toghraei had never had legal troubles in his life. In late middle age, he was being told that he was too dangerous to allow through an international border.</p>
<p>Toghraei walked out of the airport dazed. In the chill of the Calgary autumn, he sat down on a bench to call his wife. As he opened his phone, he began to cry. The quiet waste management engineer had no idea that the moment — the ban from the U.S., caused by the IRGC terror listing — was only the first chapter in the near-total unraveling of his life.</p>

Over two dozen individuals with Western passports who did mandatory military service in the IRGC at some time in their life told The Intercept about experiences like Toghraei’s at international ports of entry. The men — as conscripts, they are all men — are mostly Iranian Canadian, but some hailed from other places, including Australia and European Union countries.</p>
<p>The problems described by the Canadian former conscripts began after the Trump administration designated the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization under Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. In announcing the move, President Donald Trump <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-designation-islamic-revolutionary-guard-corps-foreign-terrorist-organization/">said</a> the &#8220;IRGC actively participates in, finances, and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraft.&#8221; Elite divisions within the IRGC conduct Iran&#8217;s clandestine foreign policy, including carrying out proxy wars and supporting nonstate actors that have targeted civilians. It was the first time, Trump said, that the U.S. had designated part of a foreign government as a terror group.</p>
<p>Many, like Toghraei, disclosed their IRGC service during their immigration to the West and now find themselves retroactively placed under suspicion. Many of them suspect that, owing to the designation, they have been placed on a U.S. terrorism watchlist: a process so opaque that even <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/09/06/terrorism-watchlist-lawsuit-ruling/">confirming whether one is on the list can be impossible</a>. As non-U.S. citizens, they have little recourse to challenge their place in such a database.</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s designation of the Revolutionary Guards was considered highly controversial, even among <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/04/08/designating-irgc-terrorist-organization-will-make-us-relations-with-iran-more-difficult-heres-how/">critics of the Iranian government</a>. Most rank-and-file recruits to the IRGC serve as those in other branches of the Iranian military do: ­without a choice. Failure to report for conscription is considered illegal, and without completing their mandatory service, Iranians cannot claim passports or even open bank accounts.</p>
<p>The IRGC’s designation recently became a flashpoint in U.S. negotiations with Iran aimed at reviving the Obama-era nuclear deal. While the Iranians have pushed for the Revolutionary Guards to be delisted as part of any revived agreement, the Biden administration has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-26/iran-says-it-has-agreement-with-three-countries-on-nuclear-deal">reportedly hesitated to take this step</a> — potentially out of concern over how the issue will be portrayed by their domestic political opponents in future elections.</p>
<p>Over the past several weeks, the back and forth on the IRGC listing became public. During an appearance in Qatar last week, Robert Malley, the U.S. envoy for Iran, who suggested no nuclear accord was imminent, said that, <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/washington-to-maintain-sanctions-on-irgc-even-with-iran-nuclear-deal-us-envoy-says/">regardless</a> of whether a deal was struck, sanctions on the IRGC would remain in place. The Iranians, meanwhile, have sent <a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2022/03/iran-fm-says-irgc-sanctions-red-line-vienna-talks">mixed signals</a> on the matter. Officials have occasionally hinted that they might be willing to accept the IRGC’s terrorist designation as fait accompli before returning to strongly insisting that it be delisted before any deal is signed.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, in an apparent reference to the IRGC listing, White House press secretary Jen Psaki suggested that the designation was outside the scope of current talks. “<span class="c-mrkdwn__highlight">Iran</span> has raised a number of issues that has nothing to do with the mutual compliance under the nuclear deal,” she <a class="c-link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2022/04/04/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-and-national-security-advisor-jake-sullivan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>. “So, we would encourage <span class="c-mrkdwn__highlight">Iran</span> to focus on the deal negotiated in Vienna” — where the original nuclear agreement was struck — “rather than seeking to open issues outside the Vienna context.”</p>

<p>As likely intended by the Trump administration, the IRGC’s terrorist listing could well become a poison pill for pursuing <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/10/15/saudi-iran-trump-diplomacy/">any form of diplomacy with Iran</a>.</p>
<p>“Policies like this end up creating another layer of this institutional enmity aimed at making sure that the U.S. and Iran never come to terms,” said Trita Parsi, co-founder and executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, in reference to the Trump-era terror listing. “It inherently creates problems when you’re designating the entire army of another state as a terrorist organization, when that state also has conscription. Ultimately, these expansive definitions of terrorism end up impacting folks who had no fault of their own for their situation.”</p>
<p>The lives of Toghraei and others affected by this policy are now captive to domestic politics in the U.S. and the hostile U.S.-Iran relationship. Toghraei himself is a Canadian citizen who has not set foot in Iran in a decade and a half. Since being arrested and tortured in Iran following a student protest in 1999, he has feared even visiting Iran. Yet his ability to live a normal life in the West has been ruined because of a policy enacted by Trump and now carried forward by Joe Biden.</p>

<p>In many ways, he is typical of those who have made up the bulk of IRGC recruits over the years: young men who served in the organization absent ideological purposes because they were required to by Iranian law. Though some senior Iranian security officials with alleged histories of rights abuses have lived in or <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/world/iran-morteza-talaei-richmond-hill">visited the West</a>, experts on the IRGC say that it is common knowledge that ordinary conscripts make up the majority of its personnel.</p>
<p>“The IRGC is deliberately ideological at the leadership level, but it recruits its rank and file through mandatory conscription, and a large percentage of its standing force consists of these conscripts. Generally, conscripts have no say in the matter once they are assigned to the IRGC,” said Afshon Ostovar, an associate professor of national security affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School and author of “Vanguard of the Imam: Religion, Politics, and Iran&#8217;s Revolutionary Guards.” “Serving as a conscript doesn’t signal anything about a person’s ideological affiliation or politics ­— it shouldn’t serve as a red flag. As a conscript, you don’t have a choice: You’re just obeying the laws of your country.”</p>
<p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection, its parent agency the Department of Homeland Security, the White House&#8217;s National Security Council, and the State Department did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>The designation has affected a raft of Canadian Iranians. One man, who did not want to speak on the record for fear of retaliation, said he was detained and interrogated by Mexican authorities at Cancun International Airport for over 12 hours without food and water before being sent back to Canada. A case of another, Farzad Alavi, was covered by the Canadian press after he was denied entry to the U.S. over his past conscription service even <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/iranian-canadian-u-s-border-cbp-assassination-1.5478582">after his own wife was killed</a> in the 2020 downing of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 by the Iranian military. In March, a famous Iranian singer with Canadian citizenship, Alireza Ghorbani, was slated to perform at an Iranian New Year dinner in the U.S. but was barred from entering after being interrogated about his past military service by CBP agents.</p>
<p>Although exact numbers are hard to come by, Ostovar and other experts say that the official figures — between 125,000 to 150,000 enlisted members of the IRGC in Iran at any given time — are “broadly correct,” while other <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-47852262">estimates</a> have put the number of active IRGC personnel at 190,000. Given the relatively short terms of service for most conscripted Guards, the size of the force means there are huge numbers of current and former IRGC members in Iran and living around the world, all of whom may now be treated as potential terrorists while traveling by the U.S. government and its intelligence partners.</p>

<p>“Conscripts serve anywhere from 18 months to two years, so every two years you’re having a new influx of tens of thousands of conscripts. Put together, you are churning out quite a lot of ex-IRGC members every decade,” said Ostovar. “Creating a dragnet targeting all these people is completely unhelpful. It’s one of the reasons why, generally speaking, we don’t list national militaries as terrorist organizations. There are just too many complicating factors.”</p>

Dehkordi was separated from his wife and children and taken into an interrogation room where he was asked about his past military service, photographed, and given a form to fill out which included questions about his nationality and religion. Like Toghraei, he was a Canadian citizen who had been conscripted into the IRGC years ago as a young man. Dehkordi&#8217;s service had ended over a decade ago.</p>

<p>As his family, who were allowed to clear customs, waited for him at the baggage claim area, Dehkordi spent what felt like an eternity fielding questions from Mexican border agents. “After hours of waiting with no explanation, someone came in and told me, ‘Sorry, we cannot let you in.’ They said that this decision comes from higher authorities and there is nothing they can do,” Dehkordi said. “They didn’t even let me see my wife and kids outside. I called them on my cellphone and told them that they should continue on the trip without me.”</p>
<p>Dehkordi said the Mexican officials told him simply that his passport had been “flagged” and that he should take up the matter with his government. He was put on a flight back to Canada that took him to an entirely different part of the country than where he lives.</p>

<p>A consultant for a multinational firm with offices in the U.S., Dehkordi’s job requires him to make frequent trips to the U.S. Although he has earned a temporary reprieve due to a slowdown on travel due to the pandemic, he fears that in future he may lose his job if his inability to move freely persists.</p>
<p>“I’ve been living in Canada for almost 10 years. I’ve been law-abiding. I pay my taxes. I work like any other person. This is me. I have no association with the IRGC or any military organization in Iran,” Dehkordi said. “I have young kids, and they are afraid that every time we go as a family to the airport, we are going to be detained. I left Iran because I couldn’t really tolerate the situation there with no freedom of speech, no personal freedoms. Now it feels like I have no place in my old country and no place in my new country because of this situation.”</p>
<p>The Intercept interviewed others who had similar experiences at borders in North America and in European countries, many of whom did not want to speak on record for fear of retaliation. Some were detained and questioned at border checkpoints but ultimately allowed to pass, while others were barred from entry and immediately deported. Hundreds of former Iranian conscripts have shared similar stories in WhatsApp and Telegram chat groups reviewed by The Intercept. The proscription has affected U.S. relatives of former conscripts, who have been separated from their spouses and other family members as a result of the Trump administration’s designation and the attendant inability of their spouses to get immigration papers or travel to the U.S.</p>
<p>Many of those who spoke to The Intercept described U.S. border agents asking them about their military service specifically using the Persian-language terms Artesh and Sepah to refer to the regular military and the IRGC, respectively. One former IRGC conscript, in response to questions from U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents about his religion, even produced documents showing that he was Jewish, something that he had concealed in Iran during his service. The individual, who was a Canadian citizen traveling across the U.S.-Canada border and asked for anonymity for fear of retaliation, was denied entry by an agent who, he said, told him that “our countries are at war.”</p>

<p>The problems faced by former conscripts seem set to get worse. The British parliament recently <a href="https://www.iranintl.com/en/202201207024">debated</a> the possibility of following the United States’s lead in designating the IRGC as a terrorist organization, with parliamentarians stating that the matter is “under review.” Hawkish special interest groups in Canada and Europe have also pushed for further designations. The possibility of more countries around the world listing the IRGC as a terrorist organization has former conscripts fearing a future in which they are unable to travel or subject to worse restrictions at home: treated as terrorists in the West at large and in their own adopted countries.</p>
<p>“We are all reading the news and feeling completely helpless,” said Ali M., an Iranian Canadian software engineer in his mid-40s who was banned from entering the U.S. last year and also did not want to use his full name for fear of retaliation. “If other countries follow the U.S. and take this step, it’s only going to become a bigger problem in our lives. We need the U.S. to know that regardless of their problem with the Iranian government, we had no choice in this matter of being conscripted.”</p>
<p>Like others who spoke with The Intercept, Ali is an educated professional who frequently works with U.S. companies. His job is in IT, or information technology, and requires him to travel to the U.S. to meet clients and work on projects, something which he has done hundreds of times over the past five years. Deprived of his freedom to travel, with no accusations of any wrongdoing against him that he could even contest, Ali might lose his ability to even earn a livelihood for his family.</p>
<p>“We’re ordinary people, man. I did my mandatory service in Iran because that was the law there, and I never hid my conscription when I immigrated to Canada because I’ve always followed the law here as well. We came here because we were seeking a better life,” he said. “I don’t know what is going to happen down the road anymore, who is going to pay my mortgage and pay the expenses for my kids. The authorities should at least give us a chance to prove ourselves, to prove that we are not any danger, but nobody listens.”</p>

Several civil liberties experts who spoke with The Intercept said that the experiences of Iranian dual nationals of Western countries being detained at border crossings is consistent with being <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2014/07/23/blacklisted/">watchlisted</a>. The size and scope of the list is unclear, but past reporting by The Intercept as well as documents disclosed during lawsuits have pegged its size at over 1.2 million people. Information from the watchlist is also shared with foreign countries, which has led in the past to U.S. citizens being <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/05/30/no-fly-list-terrorism-watchlist/">detained while traveling abroad</a>.</p>
<p>“The extent to which U.S. watchlists are garbage-in, garbage-out is shocking and the consequences of watchlisting no less so,” said Ramzi Kassem, a City University of New York School of Law professor and founder of the Creating Law Enforcement Accountability &amp; Responsibility project, or CLEAR. “What compounds the problem is that shoddy watchlist information is often shared with foreign governments, with drastic repercussions for those concerned when they arrive in countries where the authorities torture and disappear people with even less restraint than the United States.”</p>
<p>Kassem, who has litigated watchlisting cases with CLEAR, noted that designating the IRGC as a terror group was bound to have profound consequences for large numbers of people.</p>

<p>“When the United States designates a large branch of a foreign military, like the IRGC, in a country that has mandatory conscription for men, like Iran, the fallout is immense,” he said. “It is taking a contemporary, highly politicized terrorism designation and applying it without limitation to hundreds of thousands of people who had no real choice in their situation, most of whom are not currently nor even recently affiliated with the designated group.”</p>
<p>The former IRGC conscripts are not the only people of Iranian origin who have fallen victim to geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and Iran at the border. Following the U.S. government’s assassination of Iranian Gen. Qassim Suleimani, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/06/us/border-iranians-washington-patrol.html">reports</a> emerged of hundreds of travelers of Iranian origin, including <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/01/06/border-iranian-american-iran/">American citizens</a>, being detained by border officials. In one case, a Canadian truck driver even reported being denied entry to the U.S. <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-wednesday-edition-1.5436112/canadian-truck-driver-who-shares-last-name-with-iranian-general-says-he-can-t-cross-u-s-border-1.5438078">due to his last name</a>.</p>
<p>Experts on watchlisting say that the consequences of treating all former IRGC conscripts as possible terrorists threaten to systematize this type of harassment far more broadly.</p>
<p>“There are tens of thousands of Iranian Canadian men alone who have done conscription service in the Iranian military and are potentially affected by these watchlisting policies. This affects a lot of people; it isn’t just a few cases,” said Tim McSorley, the national coordinator for the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group, a civil rights organization based in Canada that has consulted with Iranian Canadians. “When you are traveling with your family to a foreign country where you do not have access to legal protections and find yourself detained, it’s a terrifying experience. That is something people shouldn’t have to go through — absent real, credible evidence that they pose a security threat, and not simply because they were forced to serve in a foreign army at some point in their life.”</p>
<p>McSorley said that placement on the U.S. watchlist can affect individuals’ ability to travel anywhere in the world, as the flight manifest of any aircraft that crosses U.S. airspace is subject to vetting. In other instances of watchlisting, U.S. intelligence information including individuals’ watchlist status have reportedly been shared with foreign governments — sometimes authoritarian ones. Such information sharing likely gave rise to the former IRGC conscripts’ problems traveling to Mexico and other countries that inquired about their military service.</p>
<p>“There are many people who fled Iran because they had disagreements with the government there, though they still had to serve in the military like anyone else. Now these same people have Western citizenship and are facing detentions, interrogations, travel bans and other possible restrictions on their freedom while being treated as suspected terrorists,” said McSorley. “This is another consequence of very broad antiterrorism laws and watchlisting practices that on paper are meant to serve security purposes but simply end up damaging the lives of people who pose no threat.”</p>

Shortly after informing his manager that he was not able to return to work, Toghraei was let go from his job in Wisconsin. The resulting financial pressure from his unemployment contributed to the disintegration of his nearly 30-year marriage.</p>
<p>“I lost everything because of this. Two months after I was let go from my job, my wife asked for divorce, because of the stress she said this had brought into our lives and because I was unable to provide,” Toghraei told me at a Tim Hortons coffee shop in Edmonton, Alberta, where he is now living with a friend. “I lost a lot because of the way that I was treated. It was not just money lost and the impact on my family but emotional problems and psychological problems that I suffered.”</p>

<p>Toghraei continues publishing books about wastewater management<strong> </strong>and recently got consulting work in Canada. He spends an increasing amount of his time connecting with other former Iranian conscripts living in the West. They share information about their experiences, which Toghraei and others pass to local officials and civil liberties groups to spur some change in their situation. The former conscripts have also found a measure of moral support in their connections; many of them are depressed or fearful about their futures. Those that Toghraei speaks to are nervous about ending up like him, particularly if more countries follow the United States’s lead in designating the IRGC as a terror group.</p>
<p>Toghraei himself feels trapped between two worlds. He immigrated from Iran decades ago and built a happy and successful life in Canada with a family and career. Now, he is a hostage to U.S. policy toward the country of his birth — a place that he doesn’t even feel safe to visit. While other former conscripts are closely watching the outcome of the ongoing Iran nuclear talks in Vienna, where the issue of the IRGC’s listing remains still on the agenda, Toghraei has lost hope that his predicament will be solved.</p>
<p>“I am now in a situation where both the U.S. hates me and Iran hates me. I’m on this blacklist that I can’t control. I don’t know what my situation will be tomorrow in Canada, let alone if I can travel abroad to Europe or Mexico,” Toghraei said, in between slow sips of coffee. “High-ranking officials from the Iranian government travel freely to America to negotiate without problems, but I’m just a little person so they feel they can just destroy my life with their policy. I think it is very shameful for the U.S. government that they treated me this way.”</p>
<p>“I’m not looking to push anyone over this or to cause any problems,” Toghraei said. “I just want people to know what they did to me.”</p>

<p><u>In the late 1990s,</u> at a time when U.S. global dominance still looked invincible, Singaporean diplomat and academic Kishore Mahbubani raised questions about whether a rising Asia might thwart American hegemony in the near future.</p>
<p>The crux of Mahbubani’s argument — laid out in his provocatively titled 1998 book, “Can Asians Think?” — was that Western elites, then flush with their victory in the Cold War, had become overly comfortable with dictating the bounds of legitimate debate and sound policy to the rest of the world. That imperious relationship, which had existed since the colonial period, was about to come to an end, said Mahbubani. Asians and other non-Westerners had their own ideas about how the world should be run and would soon have the strength to implement them.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->
<p>A few decades later, the war in Ukraine is revealing how right Mahbubani was. Despite the browbeating of U.S. politicians to take a side in the conflict, a growing number of Asian, African, and Latin American countries have charted a neutral path. China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Indonesia, South Africa, and even Mexico have remained aloof, resisting calls to diplomatically isolate Russia or join the campaign to sanction its economy. Asian companies <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/3/21/as-firms-shun-russia-asias-brands-demur-on-corporate-exodus">have remained in Russia</a> even as their Western counterparts have departed en masse. At the United Nations, meanwhile, a bevy of African states, largest among them South Africa, have <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2022/03/09/figure-of-the-week-african-countries-votes-on-the-un-resolution-condemning-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/">abstained</a> from resolutions aimed at ostracizing Russian President Vladimir Putin for the invasion.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[2](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[2] -->
<p>The neutral stance of these countries has evidently come as a shock to many Western elites, long accustomed to instructing other nations on what geopolitical positions they must take.</p>
<p>The way the West corralled support as the only superpower during and after the Cold War, in other words, is no longer effective.</p>
<p><u>India offers the</u> best example of just how much this posture of self-interested neutrality has caught U.S. elites unawares. Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, an exemplar of the U.S. foreign policy establishment, <a href="https://twitter.com/RichardHaass/status/1497188337483980801">denounced</a> India for its neutral stance. Haass, apparently unaware of his patronizing tone, said that India’s refusal to side against Russia proved that the country of 1.2 billion people “remains unprepared to step up to major power responsibilities or be a dependable partner.” President Joe Biden similarly criticized India for being “shaky” in its response to Russia, compared with European Union countries and Japan, which have rallied to the Ukrainian cause.</p>
<p>American leaders have long hoped that India would be willing to serve as a partner in helping the U.S. contain China and uphold the U.S.-backed liberal order. As it turns out, India has its own interests to pursue. It is a major customer of Russian arms and energy, enjoying a long relationship with Moscow going back to the Cold War. Morality aside, there are concrete, material reasons that Indians would not want to sacrifice these ties simply to win praise in Washington.</p>
<p>India is far from the only country that has remained studiously neutral over Ukraine. In a development that visibly irritated U.S. diplomats, a large number of African countries are also choosing to stand on the sidelines. Following a U.N. vote condemning Russia for its invasion from which 17 African nations chose to abstain, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield criticized the countries for their alleged failure to understand the gravity of the situation, paying no mind to their own <a href="https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2022/03/18/russias-grain-export-restrictions-could-affect-africa/">commercial</a> or security ties with Russia and <a href="https://usun.usmission.gov/ambassador-linda-thomas-greenfields-interview-with-anne-soy-of-bbc-news-africa/">practically demanding</a> that they take a stance that follows the American position:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think what I make of it is that we have to do additional work to help these countries to understand the impact of Russia’s war of aggression on Ukraine, and I think that we have done some of that work already in terms of engaging with those countries. I think many of them saw an abstention as being neutral, and there is no neutral ground here. There is no question. … You cannot stand on the sidelines and watch the aggression that we see taking place in Ukraine and say you’re going to be neutral about it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Like India, African nations of course have their own interests in the conflict separate from those of the United States. Many of them have good relations with Russia and have built critical economic and political ties with Putin’s government. Russia is a major provider of raw materials like wheat and also enjoys <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-steadily-rebuilding-presence-in-africa/6452193.html">genuine popularity</a> as an alternative to the West for investment and security support. While many Western countries pledged to take in Ukrainian refugees over the past month, Africans living in Europe have suffered racism at border crossings while trying to flee the conflict themselves — something that has become a major issue of concern for many Africans, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/05/ukraine-african-refugees-racism/">including diplomats</a>, but was ignored by Thomas-Greenfield in her comments calling on the African nations to get in line.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/russias-invasion-ukraine-may-drive-wedge-between-west-and-africa">article</a> criticizing the U.S. ambassador&#8217;s remarks, Africa scholar Ebenezer Obadare pointed out that Thomas-Greenfield had treated Africans as effectively “moral adolescents who require Western supervision in order to understand and do what is right,” demanding their support for the U.S. position on Ukraine while failing to account for their own interests or perspectives. There is still time for U.S. officials to try a new approach, Obadare said. It is unclear, though, whether diplomats from a superpower accustomed to having its way around the world are capable of a more nuanced approach.</p>
<p><u>The irony of</u> an independent, nonaligned world order emerging at this precise moment to buck the U.S. is that the American position on the war in Ukraine is built on a strong moral case. U.S. leaders are right to criticize Russia for a brutal, unprovoked invasion of a sovereign country. The use of naked force to coerce a democracy into sacrificing its independence is a dangerous development that there is legitimate reason to condemn. Yet after decades of aggression and abuses of its own, much of the world seems to have concluded that U.S. credibility has run dry on such matters.</p>
<p>Rather than lining up with one or another bloc, as they were forced to in the Cold War, we are instead seeing the emergence of a genuinely post-American world. Many of the countries now thumbing their nose at the U.S., including aspiring great powers like India and China, are guilty of their own grave human rights abuses. Yet it is unlikely that they will ever return to their prior roles as supplicants or followers of the West.</p>
<p>Years ago, Mahbubani, the Singaporean diplomat and author, already saw the shape of this world that is now clearly coming into view. Through a mixture of error and inevitability, the West was going into decline, and many of the values it had brought into existence would decline along with it.</p>
<p>For better or worse, whatever comes next will be a clean break from the past several centuries of Western hegemony, not just in politics but in culture and ideas as well.</p>
<p>“Western values do not form a seamless web. Some are good. Some are bad,” Mahbubani wrote. “But one has to stand outside the West to see this clearly, and to see how the West&#8217;s relative decline is being brought about by its own hand.”</p>

<p><u>On Wednesday,</u> the U.S. announced a flood of new weaponry into Ukraine, including advanced anti-aircraft weaponry and small arms aimed at helping the Ukrainian government repel Russia’s invasion. The weapons will almost certainly kill more Russian service members in Ukraine, adding to the thousands who are already believed to have died in the past few weeks. The arms may also, paradoxically, serve a more humanitarian purpose: helping bring the conflict to a stalemate and putting the Ukrainian government in a stronger position to negotiate an end to the war.</p>
<p>Ending the war by such a negotiated outcome could also serve to reduce civilian harm in a perhaps less expected way: providing an opportunity to end the economic warfare that is already doing damage to millions of innocent Russians.</p>
<p>The United States and its allies have waged the economic total war against Russia since the start of the invasion, quickly making Russia the most heavily sanctioned country on Earth. This economic offensive is already inflicting harm on everyday Russians, including those opposed to Vladimir Putin’s government. Yet as effective as these sanctions are at driving Russians into poverty, it’s uncertain whether they will affect the course of the war in Ukraine. Undeterred, the Russian military is still bombarding Ukrainian cities like Kharkiv and Mariupol with artillery and airstrikes on a nightly basis.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->
<p>Paired with diplomatic pressure, military aid that helps the conflict reach a stalemate could end the war sooner by making it nearly impossible for the Russian military, which is already showing signs of exhaustion, to take major urban centers and win a decisive victory. With military victory off the table, negotiations could bring a meaningful end to the war, prevent a nightmare scenario of occupation and insurgency, and — crucially, for humanitarian purposes — allow many Russia sanctions to be lifted in exchange for concessions to Ukrainian sovereignty.</p>
<p>There are reasons for the international community to support taking a hard line in defense of Ukraine, including by providing them weaponry. What is at stake is not just one country’s sovereignty but the already-besieged post-World War II principle that large countries cannot simply devour their neighbors or reshape their borders through armed force. The final death of that principle on the streets of Ukrainian cities will make the world a more violent place than even what we see today. It will mean a regrowth of the violent jungle that characterized Europe during the period of the world wars — but spread over the entire planet.</p>
<p><u>The current, punitive</u> approach of targeting ordinary Russians through economic warfare is likely to be both harmful and ineffective. Tailored sanctions against oligarchs and Russian officials involved in human rights abuses during the current war are warranted, but even the harshest such economic measures will not be enough to stop a regime that has already put its political credibility at stake in conquering Ukraine. Responding to Putin’s military aggression by denying ordinary Russians access to their life savings is a cruel non sequitur that does little to help Ukrainians.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[2](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A1%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="1"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[2] -->
<p>The oft-unspoken aim of the present approach of trying to immiserate Russian society is that it will stoke so much discontent that it results in regime change. Yet the Russian masses have little say over their government or their leaders, who are glad to <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/03/09/russia-dissidents-ukraine-invasion-navalny/">repress any serious dissent</a>, so fomenting bottom-up revolutionary change seems extremely unlikely. Past sanctions campaigns against countries like Iraq and Iran have never resulted in such regime collapse. Even the Cuban government is still in power after decades under economic embargo.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[3] -->
<p>Instead of toppling governments, there is even reason to believe that sanctions like those now being implemented on Russia can help <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/economic-sanctions-too-much-of-a-bad-thing/">solidify</a> authoritarian leaders’ hold on power: forcing their middle classes to focus more on survival than political change, while regime-connected elites hoard resources and become gatekeepers to what remains of the economy. Some leaders of sanctioned countries have even turned sanctions into a means of <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2015/01/17/sanctions-can-be-counter-productive-in-instigating-democratic-reform-in-authoritarian-regimes/">ideological legitimization</a>, portraying themselves as nationalist defenders against hostile foreign powers&#8217; economic warfare.</p>
<p>Then there are the calls for a more robust, direct intervention against Russia. These ideas are nonstarters. The breathless calls for a NATO-backed no-fly zone fail to acknowledge that the policy would constitute an act of war, requiring direct targeting of Russian military assets. There is also the small but real possibility of <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/03/11/nuclear-war-russia-ukraine-invasion-putin-biden/">nuclear escalation</a>, a disaster that Cold War-era military officials avoided only with great care.</p>
<p>A significant boost to Ukrainian firepower might allow President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government to reach terms with Putin, spurring a negotiated end to the war short of surrender. Instead, the current balance could see something like what happened in Syria, where foreign powers provided enough weaponry to the opposition to keep it fighting but not enough to win or force a permanent stalemate. The result in Syria was that much of the country was destroyed over the course of a decade, while the Assad regime remained in power.</p>

<p>Letting the Ukrainian government fall while <a href="https://twitter.com/msnbc/status/1498490752065757184">arming a long-term insurgency against Russian control</a> — or even a lengthy, debilitating siege where the Ukrainians hang on, but only in pockets — could make the country permanently unstable, killing Russian conscripts and ordinary Ukrainians in huge numbers while failing to bring a return to peace. Ukraine would truly become a European version of Syria — or even Afghanistan during the war against the Soviets: the social fabric destroyed beyond repair and an incubator for far-right terrorist groups established in the wreckage.</p>
<p>Such an outcome would be a disaster for everyone. Putin would enrage the West by deposing or killing Zelenskyy, a liberal political leader now widely viewed as a hero for his role during the crisis, and imposing a puppet in his place. The misery of de facto occupation and insurgency in Ukraine would be accompanied by the misery that a broad sanctions regime imposed on Russians for years to come.</p>

<p><u>During the Cold War,</u> Russia and the United States fought proxy battles all over the world that did not result in conventional war between the big powers, let alone nuclear escalation. Maintaining <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2022/03/us-russia-agree-deconfliction-hotline-putins-attack-ukraine-escalates/362750/">deconfliction hotlines</a> and avoiding scenarios that lead to NATO and Russian troops shooting at each other directly are critically important. There is no scenario that significantly raises the risk of nuclear conflict that can be tolerated, but that doesn’t mean NATO countries are constrained from giving more serious help to Ukrainians.</p>
<p>It scarcely needs saying, but there are no good options today in Ukraine. Sending more arms to a country at war seems like a paradoxical way of lessening harm to innocent people. Raising our eyes beyond the short-term, however, there are reasonable grounds to believe that such a policy of bolstering the legitimate Ukrainian government could spare the lives of more people than letting the country collapse into Putin’s hands — or dooming 140 million Russian civilians to life under permanent economic siege.</p>
<p>A continued flow of arms is a logical step given the brutal reality of Russia’s continued attacks across Ukraine. Averting disaster may now depend on whether the Western countries can prevent the fall of Kyiv in the weeks to come. Simply put, sustainable peace in Europe will not happen without a strengthened Ukraine. There is still time to save the continent from returning to the savagery that it experienced in the 20th century. That time, however, is running out — and quickly.</p>

<p><u>Ukraine was once</u> home to thousands of nuclear weapons. The weapons were stationed there by the Soviet Union and inherited by Ukraine when, at the end of the Cold War, it became independent. It was the third-largest nuclear arsenal on Earth. During an optimistic moment in the early 1990s, Ukraine’s leadership made what today seems like a fateful decision: to disarm the country and abandon those terrifying weapons, in exchange for signed guarantees from the international community ensuring its future security.</p>
<p>The decision to disarm was portrayed at the time as a means of ensuring Ukraine’s security through agreements with the international community — which was exerting pressure over the issue — rather than through the more economically and politically costly path of maintaining its own nuclear program. Today, with Ukraine being swarmed by heavily armed invading Russian troops bristling with weaponry and little prospect of defense from its erstwhile friends abroad, that decision is looking like a bad one.</p>

<p>The tragedy now unfolding in Ukraine is underlining a broader principle clearly seen around the world: Nations that sacrifice their nuclear deterrents in exchange for promises of international goodwill are often signing their own death warrants. In a world bristling with weapons with the potential to end human civilization, nonproliferation itself is a morally worthwhile and even necessary goal. But the experience of countries that actually have disarmed is likely to lead more of them to conclude otherwise in the future.</p>
<p>The betrayal of Ukrainians in particular cannot be understated. In 1994, the Ukrainian government signed a memorandum that brought its country into the global Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty while formally relinquishing its status as a nuclear state. The text of that agreement stated that in exchange for the step, the “Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine.”</p>
<p>Ukraine’s territorial integrity has not been much respected since. After the 2014 annexation of the Ukrainian territory of Crimea by Russia — which brought no serious international response — Ukrainian leaders had already begun to think twice about the virtues of the agreement they had signed just two decades earlier. Today they sound positively bitter about it.</p>

<p>“We gave away the capability for nothing,” Andriy Zahorodniuk, a former defense minister of Ukraine, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/05/science/ukraine-nuclear-weapons.html">said</a> this month about his nation’s former nuclear weapons. “Now, every time somebody offers us to sign a strip of paper, the response is, ‘Thank you very much. We already had one of those some time ago.’”</p>
<p><u>Ukrainians are not</u> the only ones who have come to regret signing away their nuclear weapons. In 2003, Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi made a surprise announcement that his nation would abandon its nuclear program and chemical weapons in exchange for normalization with the West.</p>
<p>“Libya stands as one of the few countries to have voluntarily abandoned its WMD programs,” wrote Judith Miller a few years later in an <a href="https://www.judithmiller.com/503/gadhafis-leap-of-faith">article</a> about the decision headlined “Gadhafi&#8217;s Leap of Faith.” Miller, then just out of the New York Times, added that the White House had opted “to make Libya a true model for the region” by helping encourage other states with nuclear programs to follow Gaddafi’s example.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[3] -->
<p>Libya kept moving forward. It signed on to an additional protocol of the International Atomic Energy Agency allowing for extensive international monitoring of nuclear reserves. In return, sanctions against the country were lifted and relations between Washington and Tripoli, severed during the Cold War, were reestablished. Gaddafi and his family spent a few years <a href="https://twitter.com/senjohnmccain/status/3331878099?lang=en">building ties with Western elites</a>, and all seemed to be going well for the Libyan dictator.</p>
<p>Then came the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings. Gaddafi found that the same world leaders who had ostensibly become his economic partners and diplomatic allies were suddenly providing decisive military aid to his opposition — even <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/clinton-on-qaddafi-we-came-we-saw-he-died/">cheering</a> on his own death.</p>
<p>Promises, betrayals, aggression: It’s a pattern that extends even to countries that have merely considered foreclosing their avenues to a nuclear deterrent.</p>

<p>Take Iran: In 2015, the Islamic Republic signed a comprehensive nuclear deal with the U.S. that limited its possible breakout capacity toward building a nuclear weapon and provided extensive monitoring of its civilian nuclear program. Not long afterward, the agreement was violated by the Trump administration, despite the country’s own continued compliance. Since 2016, when Donald Trump left the deal, Iran has been hit with crushing international sanctions that have devastated its economy and been subjected to a campaign of assassination targeting its senior military leadership.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[5](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22left%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-left" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="left"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[5] -->To date, no nuclear-armed state has ever faced a full-scale invasion by a foreign power, regardless of its own actions.<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[5] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[5] -->
<p>The nuclear deal was characterized at the time as the first step toward a broader set of talks over regional disputes between Iranian and U.S. leaders, who had been alienated since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Instead, the deal marked another bitter chapter in the long-troubled relationship between the two countries.</p>
<p>To date, no nuclear-armed state has ever faced a full-scale invasion by a foreign power, regardless of its own actions. North Korea has managed to keep its hermetic political system intact for decades despite tensions with the international community. North Korean officials have even cited the example of Libya in discussing their own weapons. In 2011, as bombs rained down on Gaddafi’s government, a North Korean foreign ministry official <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/world/asia/25korea.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=North%20Korea%20Libya%20nuclear&amp;st=cse">said</a>, “The Libyan crisis is teaching the international community a grave lesson.” That official went on to refer to giving up weapons in signed agreements as “an invasion tactic to disarm the country.”</p>
<p>Perhaps the starkest contrast to the treatment of Ukraine, Libya, and Iran, however, is Pakistan, which developed nuclear weapons decades ago in defiance of the United States. Despite being criticized at the time for contributing to nuclear proliferation and facing periodic sanctions, Pakistan has managed to insulate itself from attack or even serious ostracism by the U.S. despite <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/05/13/what-pakistan-knew-about-the-bin-laden-raid-seymour-hersh/">several flagrant provocations</a> in the decades since. Today Pakistan even remains a security partner of the U.S., having received billions of dollars of military aid over the past several decades.</p>
<p>Given the mortal hazards that nuclear weapons pose to life on Earth, nonproliferation remains a worthwhile collective goal. Humanity will not benefit from a renewal of the nuclear arms race, and the ideals behind a U.S.-backed, rules-based liberal order are morally attractive. A world where they were truly applied would probably be a fairer and more peaceful one than what has existed in the past, yet we must also recognize that the liberal order can and will fail. That lesson is especially true for small nations outmatched by great powers.</p>
<p>Given the tragedy we are witnessing in Ukraine today — where, despite its past assurances, the international community has remained a passive observer — leaders of small countries must be forgiven for thinking twice before sacrificing their deterrent, regardless of what the leaders of great powers already armed with nuclear weaponry may say.</p>

<u>As Europe faces</u> the grim prospect of a land war on a scale it has not seen since World War II, it was Kenya’s ambassador to the United Nations, Martin Kimani, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soNBEjzWY08&amp;feature=youtu.be">delivered</a> a message that struck at the heart of the crisis: a lingering nostalgia for empire.</p>
<p>At an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council, called to discuss the Russian aggression against Ukraine, Kimani did not just condemn the threat to Ukrainian sovereignty by President Vladimir Putin’s government. He went further, highlighting how an unceasing obsession over territory and borders is continuing to drive violence around the world, long after the European empires that drew those demarcations have vanished from the map. He offered an alternate vision of peace through acceptance of the borders created by the collapse of empires and nations in the 20th century, calling for economic and cultural integration instead.</p>

<p>“Kenya, and almost every African country, was birthed by the ending of empire,&#8221; Kimani said. &#8220;Our borders were not of our own drawing. They were drawn in the distant colonial metropoles of London, Paris, and Lisbon with no regard for the ancient nations that they cleaved apart. Today, across the border of every single African country live our countrymen with whom we share deep historical, cultural, and linguistic bonds. At independence, had we chosen to pursue states on the basis of ethnic, racial, or religious homogeneity, we would still be waging bloody wars these many decades later. Instead, we agreed that we would settle for the borders we inherited.”<br />

Kimani’s remarks, which went viral on social media and in the African media, also criticized what he called the “dangerous nostalgia” for empire that leads countries to redraw borders by force to reunite with citizens of other nations with whom they share cultural affinity — the exact argument the Russian government has used to justify its invasion of Ukraine <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-putin-has-such-a-hard-time-accepting-ukrainian-sovereignty-174029">in support of Russian speakers</a> there. Instead, Kimani called on Europe to follow the rules of the U.N. charter as the African Union countries have sought to do, respecting the sovereignty of neighboring countries “not because our borders satisfied us, but because we wanted something greater forged in peace.”</p>
<p>Kimani’s speech seemed perfectly calibrated to respond to Putin’s remarks in recent days. In public statements, Putin has denigrated the very existence of Ukraine as a nation by describing it as little more than an imperial vassal that had been severed by modern politics from its rightful place under Russian control. Despite having a long independent history as well as a distinct language and culture, Ukraine has been governed in part by competing empires over the centuries, including most recently by Tsarist Russia and the Soviet Union. The country gained its full independence in 1991 after the breakup of the Soviet Union, an event Putin has <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna7632057">described</a> as “the greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century.” In a televised <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67828">address</a> on Monday in which he recognized the independence of two breakaway regions of Ukraine, Putin called Ukraine “historically Russian land” in the course of an extended pseudo-history lesson given to justify his deployment of Russian troops.</p>

<p>Putin is not alone in harboring dreams of lost empire or in trying to rebuild them by redrawing new borders in the present day. Much violence around the world seems to stem from similar sentiments held in other countries: The aggressive foreign policies of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b6d0ea59-8439-4325-a5fe-edce8db9b3dd">China</a>, <a href="https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/neo-ottomanism-turkish-foreign-policy/">Turkey</a>, <a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/iran-continues-boast-its-regional-reach">Iran</a>, and <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/short_news/speaker-of-serbian-parliament-no-borders-between-republika-srpska-and-serbia/">Serbia</a>, as well as other modern states built from the ruins of past empires, appear to be similarly fixated on restoring historic territories to which they feel they have been deprived in the present day. Though less explicitly irredentist at the moment, some Western European countries also seem to feel a sense of ownership over territories they formerly controlled, most notably <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/feature/it%E2%80%99s-not-just-mali-french-influence-africa-collapsing-200626">France</a> in the Sahel region of Africa and in Lebanon.</p>
<p>Despite the announcement of an initial round of sanctions on Russia from European Union countries, Putin still looks ready to “restore” Russian control over parts of Ukraine beyond the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Reports of troop buildups near Ukraine’s borders have continued over the past several days, while NATO leaders have said that they are still bracing for what could be a <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-russia-escalates-ukraine-crisis-with-vote-to-back-treaties-with/">full-scale invasion</a> of Ukrainian territory. Some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/05/us/politics/russia-ukraine-invasion.html">estimates</a> have said that such a war could kill tens of thousands of Ukrainian citizens and trigger a refugee crisis across Europe.</p>
<p>The United States has criticized Russia for violating another nation’s sovereignty. But given its own track record of invasions, assassinations, and torture of foreign citizens, it may not be the best messenger. Instead, at what&#8217;s certainly a dire moment for Europe, it is the words of the Kenyan ambassador that best embody the high principles of liberal internationalism and multilateral cooperation that now seem mortally endangered.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that all states formed from empires that have collapsed or retreated have many peoples in them yearning for integration with peoples in neighboring states. This is normal and understandable. After all, who does not want to be joined to their brethren and to make common purpose with them? However, Kenya rejects such a yearning from being pursued by force,&#8221; Kimani said. “We must complete our recovery from the embers of dead empires in a way that does not plunge us back into new forms of domination and oppression.&#8221;</p>
<p>Calling for a peaceful resolution to the crisis and affirming the rights of Ukrainians, he added: “Multilateralism lies on its deathbed tonight. It has been assaulted as it has been by other powerful states in the recent past.”</p>

<p><u>In a national</u> address delivered this morning, President Joe Biden performed what has now become a familiar ritual for U.S. politicians: announcing the death of a terrorist leader. The latest enemy figure whose death has been presented to Americans as a victory was the head of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Quraishi, who was reportedly killed alongside his family during a U.S. special forces raid in northern Syria last night. In brief remarks, Biden characterized the raid as a victory that had made the world more secure, and without cost to Americans.</p>
<p>“Last night at my direction, U.S. military forces in northwest Syria successfully undertook a counterterrorism operation to protect the American people and our Allies, and make the world a safer place,” Biden said in a statement early Thursday morning. “Thanks to the skill and bravery of our Armed Forces, we have taken off the battlefield Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi—the leader of ISIS. All Americans have returned safely from the operation.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->
<p>The raid on a home where al-Quraishi was staying killed a total of 13 people, including a number of women and children. Images on social media of mangled corpses immediately began circulating in the aftermath, broadcast from the scene by local journalists. The attack came after weeks of violence in northern Syria, where ISIS fighters <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20220121-is-group-kill-kurdish-security-forces-in-ongoing-attack-on-syrian-prison">staged an uprising</a> against members of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces that killed hundreds. Initial claims by Biden and other U.S. officials have suggested that the civilians killed in the raid on al-Quraishi’s house died when the ISIS leader chose to detonate his own suicide vest rather than be captured by U.S. forces. Syrian journalists also shared images online of wreckage from a crashed U.S. helicopter, though U.S. officials have echoed Biden’s statement that no Americans were harmed in the operation.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[2](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[2] -->
<p>Although al-Quraishi, alongside his family, does appear to be dead, Biden’s claim in his public address that the world has been made safer by the killing of yet another terrorist leader is hard to credit. Since the outset of the Global War on Terrorism over two decades ago, the periodic killings of commanders from groups like the Taliban, Al Qaeda, al-Shabab, and, most recently, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria have been touted as significant victories and even turning points in America’s so-called war on terror. Despite these repeated tactical victories, from which U.S. presidents have extracted much political capital over the years, the underlying wars themselves have continued and even worsened.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2021/10/killing-terrorist-leaders-is-no-silver-bullet/">article</a> in the national security publication War on the Rocks last year highlighted the limits of killing terrorist leaders as a means of strategic victory. “Too often, leadership decapitation is viewed as a panacea, as policymakers tout the removal of high-value targets to suggest a ‘turning point’ that fails to materialize,” noted Colin Clarke, the director of policy and research at the Soufan Group, a security consulting firm. “It is correct to seek to decapitate terrorist organizations, but these are tactical actions, not strategic ones.”</p>
<p>Not much is known about al-Quraishi in comparison with his more notorious predecessor, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. An <a href="https://newlinesmag.com/reportage/a-caliph-without-a-caliphate-the-biography-of-isiss-new-leader/">investigation</a> last year by the national security publication New Lines Magazine drew upon Iraqi intelligence files and interviews with individuals who had previously been incarcerated with him to paint a picture of the man who had been quietly holding the reins of ISIS over the past several years. That investigation managed to get some context about his past from personal documentation and also a photo of him while incarcerated by U.S. forces in 2008 at Camp Bucca, a military prison in Iraq. But it is unclear how much power al-Quraishi actually wielded and how important he was to an organization that has been severely diminished by years of brutal fighting. There is little reason to assume that the killing of al-Quraishi will result in anything more than a tactical reorganization of the Islamic State, or even its splintering into other, new extremist groups amid the ongoing misery and chaos of the Syrian civil war. His death is also unlikely to mean an end to the U.S. “forever wars” in the region, which have switched to a permanent mode of militarized policing in which the U.S. reserves the right to carry out bombings and assassinations at will but does not refer to these actions as “war,” even when civilians are killed in the process.</p>
<p>After a long list of failures and defeats, the U.S. public has clearly tired of its conflicts in the Middle East. But despite rhetoric from American leaders about ending the forever wars, they look likely to continue under new definitions and with new tactics. In his remarks announcing the death of al-Quraishi, even Biden refrained from promising a forthcoming end to the conflicts or even a radically transformed security situation for Americans. Though al-Quraishi, a man whom most Americans would likely have been unable to name, is now dead, along with several civilians, the two-decade-long conflict that led to his emergence still continues ­— with no horizon in sight.</p>

<u>The United Arab Emirates</u> has built an economic and political system reliant on its status as a safe harbor in an unstable region. The glittering prosperity and safety of cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi has enticed people from around the world to live, work, and invest in the small Gulf Arab country ­— just 150 kilometers from the coast of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The success of the Emirates has often felt like a bit of a miracle: a bubble of exorbitant wealth that has grown in the desert over a few short decades, thanks in large part to the contributions of expatriate workers and professionals. The fragility of this bubble however was highlighted this week, when the war in poverty-stricken Yemen, in which the UAE has taken a prominent role, finally arrived at its doorstep.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[1] -->
<p>Two separate attacks claimed by Yemeni Houthi rebels this month struck the UAE, shattering the image of calm upon which the country’s economic model depends. The first attack, a drone strike on January 17 which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/17/world/middleeast/uae-attack-yemen-houthi.html">hit the airport and a fuel depot</a> in Abu Dhabi, set off explosions that killed three expatriate workers. That attack enraged Emirati leaders, who struck back by bombing a prison in the northern Yemeni city of Saada in an <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20220123-yemen-rescuers-comb-rubble-as-coalition-slammed-over-prison-attack">attack that killed dozens</a>. The Houthis seemed undeterred by this retaliation, however, striking the Emirates again this week with a ballistic missile attack aimed at a military base outside Abu Dhabi which is home to thousands of U.S. service personnel.</p>
<p>Images of interceptor missiles lighting up the sky over the city went viral on social media, illustrating just how close the violence of Yemen had come to the wealthy Emirates. The second attack did not result in any casualties, but it further underlined that after several years of outside intervention, the war in Yemen is becoming more, not less, dangerous for the surrounding Gulf Arab states.</p>

<p>The gradual erosion of the UAE’s security bubble is attributable in large part to decisions made by its crown prince, Mohammed bin Zayed, or MBZ, who has charted an aggressive new path for Emirati foreign policy. MBZ has taken a leading role in supporting the Gulf Arab coalition’s war in Yemen, making his nation an active belligerent in a conflict that has devastated the region’s poorest country. The UAE has also fought in recent years in Libya, helping the country earn the nickname “<a href="https://mondediplo.com/2021/03/03uae-sparta">Little Sparta</a>” for its attempts to confront larger powers.</p>
<p>Emirati leaders have traditionally been conservative about their relations with other countries in the region, cognizant of their small size and the fragile nature of their expatriate-driven economic model. Under MBZ, however, the Emirates has sought to become a major player, taking a leading role in foreign military campaigns and aligning itself closely with countries outside the region, like the U.S., to contain regional powers like Turkey and Iran. MBZ has even felt confident enough to break with the traditional Arab consensus on relations with Israel, establishing not just diplomatic contacts but cordial relations with Israeli leaders in the absence of a peace agreement with the Palestinians.</p>

<p>So far, the UAE has been able to reap the benefits of an active foreign policy without paying any of the costs. But the missile attacks from Yemen, whose poverty and suffering are not geographically distant from the opulence of Abu Dhabi, shows there are limits to how far the Emiratis can go on their own. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/24/world/middleeast/us-air-force-uae-attack.html">comments</a> to the New York Times following this week’s ballistic missile attack on the Al Dhafra airbase, individuals connected to the UAE government expressed genuine puzzlement and concern that their country’s involvement in the brutal war in Yemen had rebounded back on it.</p>
<p>“We have to be honest that this is something that we are not used to,” Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, a Dubai-based political scientist, told the Times. “The U.A.E. has maintained a reputation of being a safe haven for investors, visitors and tourists.”</p>
<p>Abdulla expressed confidence that the attacks would not change the Emirates’ reputation as a safe place to live and invest. A sustained period of such attacks, however — should the war in Yemen further spiral out of control, or in the event of a larger conflagration between the U.S., Israel, and Iran — would put the Emirates on the firing line and could do irreversible damage to the country’s status as a safe harbor. Unlike other countries in the region with large native populations, the wealth of the UAE is almost wholly dependent on the millions of expatriates, both rich and poor, who live and work there. If the security upon which the country’s prosperity relies is disturbed, these foreigners will quickly leave for their home countries — taking their money and their skills with them.</p>
<p>There is still time for the UAE’s leaders to change course and return to a traditional path of regional dealmaking and compromise that has helped them preserve domestic peace. Such an approach is still exemplified by the neighboring Sultanate of Oman, which continues to act as a mediator among rivals in the Middle East. Absent that, it will be hard to keep the violence that has tormented the region from Abu Dhabi’s doorstep forever.</p>
<p>For all its many faults, the UAE genuinely has served as a place in the Middle East where people from many backgrounds have been able to live, work, and worship in relative peace. Protecting that political order requires thoughtful leadership as opposed to recklessness and belligerence. The missile attacks this month from Yemen show that the UAE is indeed a bubble, and a fragile one at that.</p>

<p><u>On Martin Luther</u> King Jr. Day, a day that should inspire reflection on the importance of universal human rights, billionaire investor and part-owner of the NBA’s Golden State Warriors Chamath Palihapitiya went viral with his own eyebrow-raising take on the subject.</p>
<p>On his podcast, Palihapitiya leapt with both feet into a debate about corporate responses to human rights violations in countries where they do business, specifically about China, where human rights advocates have documented atrocities against Uyghurs, a minority ethnic group in the Xinjiang region.</p>
<p>Palihapitiya said he did not care about the Uyghurs&#8217; predicament — and that this sentiment was broadly shared by elites who were simply unwilling to be as bold as him and just say it. &#8220;Let&#8217;s be honest, nobody cares about what&#8217;s happening to the Uyghurs, OK?” he told his visibly surprised co-host, Jason Calacanis, on their podcast over the weekend.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[1] -->&#8220;Let&#8217;s be honest, nobody cares about what&#8217;s happening to the Uyghurs, OK?”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[1] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[1] -->
<p>Palihapitiya proudly expressed his indifference at <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-55794071">reports</a> of rape and forced sterilization of Uyghur women. He dismissed Calacanis’s concern as moral “virtue signaling.”</p>
<p>“You bring it up because you really care, and I think that’s nice that you care. The rest of us don’t care,” Palihapitiya said. “I’m telling you a very hard, ugly truth. Of all the things that I care about, it is below my line.”</p>
<p>To defend his posture of uncaring, Palihapitiya turned his sights on Western countries’ own track record of human rights abuses, including wars of aggression and torture at domestic prisons. Concerns about foreign atrocities, like the furor over China and the Uyghurs, he said, have at times even served as a cover for military interventionist policies that have done even more harm.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[2](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[2] -->
<p>It’s all true, as far as it goes: The West has its atrocities, many don’t care about China’s abuses, and those who do care risk having their concerns twisted into new rights violations of their own against the same populations they expressed concern about.</p>
<p>However, it’s worth stating plainly what Palihapitiya is talking about: creating a formal conspiracy of silence between countries, including in the corporate world, over atrocities like those taking place in Xinjiang. Is that a responsible position, let alone an admirable one?</p>
<p>The biggest defense Palihapitiya might be able to mount is that at least he’s not a hypocrite: Americans commit human rights abuses, so perhaps they have no right to shame others over them.</p>
<p>Yet even hypocritical criticisms exchanged by superpowers can do good. Over the last century, history shows that they have.</p>

The Corban festival, known to Muslims worldwide as Eid al-Adha or 'feast of the sacrifice', is celebrated by ethnic Uyghurs across Xinjiang, the far-western region of China bordering Central Asia that is home to roughly half of the country's 23 million Muslims. The festival, considered the most important of the year, involves religious rites and visits to the graves of relatives, as well as sharing meals with family. Although Islam is a 'recognized' religion in the constitution of officially atheist China, ethnic Uyghurs are subjected to restrictions on religious and cultural practices that are imposed by China's Communist Party. Ethnic tensions have fueled violence that Chinese authorities point to as justification for the restrictions.  (Photo by Kevin Frayer/Getty Images)" />

<p><u>During the Cold</u> War, the U.S. and the Soviet Union engaged in serious ideological and public relations campaigns to shame each other over human rights abuses. In both cases, there were rewards to be reaped by ordinary people through the shaming.</p>
<p>The need to respond to Communist <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/10/russia-facebook-race/542796/">criticism of the treatment of Black Americans</a> helped give more political heft to the fight to end Jim Crow laws — if for no other reason than that the racist system provided strong talking points to the U.S.’s Soviet rivals.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[4](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[4] -->
<p>“Early on in the Cold War, there was a recognition that the U.S. couldn’t lead the world if it was seen as repressing people of color,” historian Mary Dudziak has said. President Harry Truman argued that civil rights would help the U.S. win global support during the Cold War and, accordingly, integrated the military.</p>
<p>Moving the other way, American pressure over the Soviet Union’s attacks on individual freedoms were also eventually felt in the Kremlin, where Soviet leaders, realizing global public opinion wouldn’t give domestic repression a pass, <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2013/07/civil-rights-coverage-how-the-soviets-used-evidence-of-racial-strife-against-us-in-the-world-press.html">eventually had to defend themselves</a>. Five years after the U.S. passed the <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Jackson%E2%80%93Vanik_amendment">Jackson–Vanik amendment</a>, for instance, the Soviet Union had eased up restrictions on the emigration of Jews such that numbers began to hit <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1979/04/04/111700609.html">record highs</a>; the issue was far from resolved, but continuing progress was widely attributed to the U.S.’s public stances.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[5](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A1%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="1"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[5] -->
<p>In that sense, the Cold War competition arguably had a positive side effect, even if it was a marginal one. Both superpowers were forced to compete at least in part on their human rights records. This was not because of any Damascene moral conversation by either government but because of the urgent need to dull the sting of their enemies’ criticism. Even if this shaming saved only a few people from lynching or the Gulag, it made a difference.</p>
<p><u>When it comes</u> to the rivalry between the U.S. and China, Palihapitiya suggested embracing the “hard, ugly truth” that it is a frivolous “luxury belief” to say anything about human rights. Doing so, though, would take the heat off leaders in both countries.</p>
<p>In his podcast appearance, Palihapitiya claimed that, since corporations and foreign nations have not actually divested from China, their rhetorical stances account for nothing. That clearly is not how the Chinese Communist Party has interpreted such criticism: Officials have devoted considerable resources to trying to change public opinion over Xinjiang and <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3144817/china-fires-back-shameless-us-over-xinjiang-human-rights-abuse">repair their reputation</a> amid a constant stream of negative press.</p>
<p>The global pressure also may have helped make a difference on the ground.</p>
<p>There are signs that China might be susceptible to international pressure. One recent report attributing a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-lifestyle-china-health-travel-7a6967f335f97ca868cc618ea84b98b9">relatively lighter grip</a> by Chinese security services over Xinjiang attributed the minor shift in part to foreign pressure, though that interpretation has been disputed. In another case, China most definitely took note of the pressure, though not by taking the desired actions: After a group of companies like Nike and H&amp;M that manufacture apparel in China joined a coalition to denounce the treatment of Uyghurs, China <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-14/china-forces-better-cotton-initiative-fashion-brands-to-be-quiet-over-xinjiang">made life difficult</a> for the coalition members.</p>
<p>China has also recently <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/china-says-era-us-acting-without-restraint-over-viral-video-million-views-afghan-drone-strike-1660070">gone on the offensive</a> against the U.S.’s abysmal human rights record in the Middle East, signaling that the old Cold War dynamic of mutual human rights criticism, at least some of it constructive, may yet carry over to the U.S.-China competition.</p>

<p>After his unfortunate episode, Palihapitiya issued a terse statement on social media expressing apparent regret for the tone of his comments: “To be clear, my belief is that human rights matter, whether in China, the United States, or elsewhere,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1483228175391866881">said</a>. “Full stop.”</p>

<p>The reconsideration was welcome: It would be a tragic mistake if other corporate leaders and political figures embraced something similar to his callous initial position.</p>
<p>Contrary to what Palihapitiya claimed in his podcast, a lot of people around the world have shown that they do in fact care about foreigners living in dire circumstances, such as the Uyghurs. They have raised their voices on the subject and made it an issue that the Chinese government feels it must respond to. If that helps even some innocent people escape oppression or defend their rights, that’s a good thing.</p>
<p>Criticism over human rights abuses can often be cynical or hypocritical, sure, but they are far preferable to a world in which even the concept of universal dignity is simply abandoned.</p>

<p><u>After hundreds of</u> years of domination by the West, the world is now primed to have an “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Century#:~:text=The%20Asian%20Century%20is%20the,century%20as%20the%20American%20Century.">Asian Century</a>.” After a long period of decline, demographic and economic trends point to Asia returning to its historic role as the world’s center of economic growth as well as the incubator of political and social change. The particular character of the Asian Century will thus have many consequences for people across the world. There are already strong signs, evidenced in the emergence of ethnonationalist, authoritarian, and religious extremist politics across the continent, that Asia’s rise will not be any less chaotic than the West before it.</p>

<p>Indian author Pankaj Mishra has dedicated his career to analyzing the psychology of Asia’s rising masses, particularly its young men. His latest work, a novel, “<a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374607524/runandhide#:~:text=%22Pankaj%20Mishra%20transforms%20a%20visceral,%2C%20illuminating%20work%20of%20fiction.%22">Run and Hide</a>,” is his most searing look at the subject yet. The book is a story about the fates of three young Indian men, graduates from the country’s most famous technical university, who rise from poverty to wealth and acclaim within a span of decades. It is a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of success in the developing world and a parable for the dark side of the Asian Century — or centuries — to come.</p>
<p>In decades past, iconic anti-colonial Asian leaders, often educated in the West, overwhelmingly tended to be left wing. They fought against Western colonialism but espoused many ideas that were shared by Western liberals, including a belief in individual freedom, secularism, and universal human rights. It stood to reason that they represented the views of a majority of their compatriots and that the nations they led, once they became wealthy and free, would be bulwarks of liberalism. On a continent where Narendra Modi, Xi Jinping, and Tayyip Erdogan are among the most popular leaders today, that assumption no longer holds any water.</p>

<p>The three men in Mishra’s novel — Virendra, Aseem, and the enigmatic main character, Arun — stand as representations of millions of Asians successfully emerging to lives free from material want but wounded by cultural loss and filled with insatiable new psychological desires. To varying degrees, the men try to “trample on the past,” to quote one of the characters’ favorite lines from V.S. Naipaul, by leaving their old cultures behind. They embrace the unfamiliar pleasures of wealth and travel, even as the more slowly ascending masses of their own country turn to reaction. Humiliated by the exploding inequalities newfound wealth like that of the protagonists has helped create, most people channel their rage into support for populist parties that promise to take revenge on their behalf against liberals and minorities.</p>
<p>In various ways, Mishra’s characters find that they are unable to survive in the new world they inhabit. Arriving at the top of the pyramid of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs — the realization of their potential — they discover that the air up there is terrifyingly thin. Their wealth and success briefly elevate them before pushing them down a glide path to self-destruction.</p>

<p><u>There is a</u> political subtext to Mishra’s book that is very important to understanding politics in the developing world: Suffering does not necessarily ennoble. People’s long-sublimated dark urges — for material goods, recognition, sex, revenge — often begin to self-destructively erupt inside them as their material conditions improve.</p>

<p>In one passage from “Run and Hide,” Arun, raised by a poor, abusive father who now supports Modi, addresses the enthusiasms of a liberal friend who grew up wealthy and unselfconsciously devotes herself to various progressive causes. “From what I had seen of non-white people, starting with my libtard-obsessed father, it seemed prudent to fear that, whatever their skin color, the poor and oppressed today were very likely to be persecutors tomorrow — even, sooner,” he tells her. He points out, with some discomfort, that the liberal friend’s progressive platitudes on Twitter do not, to use the example of the Arab Spring, “quite account for the fact that some brave protestors against tyranny in Tahrir Square could turn, given the chance, into <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2013/07/03/opinion/burleigh-rapes-tahrir-square/index.html">rapists</a>.”</p>
<p>Rising living standards in India and China have created publics with strong ultranationalist and even xenophobic views on domestic and foreign policy. These public sentiments are <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10670564.2019.1580427?journalCode=cjcc20">outpacing the capacity of their governments</a> to fully deliver on them, even though they embrace some of those qualities. Throughout the Muslim world, democratic elections have demonstrated repeatedly that religiously conservative parties have widespread support from the masses. Even in smaller Asian <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Opinion/South-Asia-s-turn-to-illiberal-democracy">countries</a> like Sri Lanka and Myanmar, militarized, authoritarian politics that disregard liberal freedoms and trample on the rights of minorities have proved popular. Countries that were once deeply poor and have now felt themselves gaining a bit of strength have shown that they have potential flaws just as deep as the Westerners whose central role in global affairs they are now gradually supplanting.</p>

<p>If the mass political awakening of Asia has revealed popular sentiments that have proved deeply illiberal, that does not make Asians so different from Westerners in their political development. Even as it became the richest and most developed region of the world — thanks in part to its ruthless colonial exploitation of Asia and Africa — Europe destroyed itself with two catastrophic world wars driven by nationalism and bigotry. Far-right parties are once again on the march on the continent as they channel popular unease among majority populations over identity and immigration. The entire Donald Trump presidency, punctuated by a now-infamous riot by his supporters at the Capitol, shows that the U.S. suffers deeply from the same trends.</p>
<p>In this way, Mishra’s own work, including “Run and Hide,” demonstrates that the fallibilities of publics in Asian countries are less proof of their own unique shortcomings than of the commonality of human behavior and psychology across the world. If the Asian Century — symbolized by countries like India and China, let alone Vietnam, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Iran, or Saudi Arabia — is to be less exploitative than the Western-dominated order that came before it, it will require giving the same ruthless scrutiny to emerging countries’ politics and social trends that we have become used to giving the West.</p>
<p>The 21st century is going to be Asian. For it to be successful, it will require a lot of painful criticism of the type that Mishra gives in his novel. The West should bring those assessments to bear when warranted, for our own good — but mainly for theirs.</p>

<u>Months after the</u> U.S.-backed Afghan government fell to the Taliban, ordinary Afghans now face what could be their direst winter in decades. Thanks to the economic collapse that accompanied the U.S. military withdrawal, coupled with the imposition of sanctions and the cessation of much humanitarian aid, millions of Afghans must contend with the very real prospect of starvation. Some will die. Many will lose their lives to preventable deaths.</p>
<p>While limited humanitarian exceptions for trade have been carved out in recent weeks, the World Health Organization has already <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/who-says-million-afghan-children-risk-dying-amid-acute-malnutrition-2021-11-12/">warned</a> that up to 1 million Afghan children may die as a result of malnutrition over this winter if drastic steps are not taken. Children are already bearing the brunt of the humanitarian catastrophe, punctuated by horrifying <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/national-international/parents-selling-children-shows-desperation-of-afghanistan/2720230/">stories</a> of kids being sold to pay for food. And the country’s notoriously harsh winter is already taking a toll: Afghans are <a href="https://www.afintl.com/202201029034">freezing to death</a> as they flee the country with their families.</p>
<p>U.S. sanctions policy is directly to blame, pushing Afghans over the edge as they already struggle to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic and the political upheaval created by the collapse of the central government. As Paul Spiegel, director of the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/12/16/hospitals-are-collapsing-afghanistan-this-rate-sanctions-will-kill-more-people-than-taliban/">wrote this December</a>, after returning from a trip to Afghanistan on behalf of the WHO, “I can clearly state that if the United States and other Western governments do not change their Afghanistan sanction policies, more Afghans will die from sanctions than at the hands of the Taliban.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->
<p>The deaths will be brought about as a result of deliberate policy decisions made in the U.S. Alongside new sanctions imposed after the Taliban takeover, the U.S. froze nearly $10 billion of Afghanistan’s central bank holdings here. The Biden administration refuses to release the funds despite ongoing <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/protests-erupt-in-afghanistan-over-us-freezing-of-funds/6363340.html">public protests</a> by Afghans.</p>
<p>As all of this plays out, the clamor of voices criticizing the U.S. military withdrawal this summer on humanitarian grounds has gone deadly silent. After the withdrawal, many <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/08/17/opinion/myth-that-afghanistan-was-forever-war/">commentators</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/04/female-senators-call-on-biden-to-protect-afghan-women-and-girls.html">political leaders</a> claimed that there was a humanitarian imperative behind the conflict, particularly the protection of Afghan women. Many of the humanitarian and feminist arguments had been used for years to help justify a military occupation that was often <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/09/13/the-other-afghan-women">despised</a> by the same people it was ostensibly defending. In contrast, ending the current sanctions regime and releasing funds owned by Afghans actually would do something unambiguously positive for civilians there, including women and children who are particularly at risk.</p>

<p>The cognitive dissonance on display is perhaps best underlined by Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. This summer, McCaul decried the fate of Afghan women. “We&#8217;re seeing this nightmare unfold — unmitigated disaster of epic proportions,” he said in an interview. “And what I really worried about the most are the women left behind and what&#8217;s going to happen to them.” When the Biden administration then put sanctions exemptions in place to allow some humanitarian aid, McCaul then turned around to <a href="https://gop-foreignaffairs.house.gov/press-release/mccaul-new-ofac-licenses-are-a-dangerous-step-towards-legitimizing-the-taliban/">condemn</a> the limited relief — even as news reports <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/27/world/asia/afghanistan-economy-collapse-sanctions.html">described</a> the economic collapse wreaking havoc on the lives of Afghans, including women and children.</p>
<p>With this new nightmare unfolding, the concern shown in August has largely faded.<br />

<h2>Many Failures of Sanctions</h2>
<p>Sanctions are one of the bluntest coercive tools in the U.S. foreign policy toolkit — and happen be a favorite of policymakers, even as they <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/08/02/do-sanctions-work-the-evidence-isnt-compelling/">rarely produce political results</a>. Afghanistan is just one example of a mindlessly cruel sanctions regime that wreaks havoc on entire civilian populations without accountability. For decades, Iranians have been subjected to some of the most <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/28/world/middleeast/iran-economy.html">crushing sanctions on earth</a>. Obstacles are erected against even the most anodyne business ventures. Young people there are unable to envision a fruitful life in the country. The sanctions on Iran were intensified under the Trump administration but have continued under President Joe Biden, as part of a desperate effort to force a total capitulation over Iran’s nuclear program.</p>

<p>Even Cold War-era sanctions on countries like Cuba continue to remain in effect to this day, absent any compelling geopolitical reasons. In a recent example that underlined the parodic nature of the Cuba sanctions policy, the rental company Airbnb was <a href="https://www.cubatrade.org/blog/2022/1/3/zqu0x27r48y8ioss5hb8dctz5qd34v">hit with a fine</a> for doing business on the island and allowing Cubans access to its accommodation services. This was just the latest limitation on ordinary Cubans’ ability to conduct basic economic transactions or engage in trade with companies headquartered abroad and thus at risk of U.S. sanctions. Despite being in place for years and making life hard for Cubans, the sanctions have done little to further U.S. foreign policy objectives.</p>
<p>“The sanctions on Cuba have been completely ineffective in achieving their policy goals,” said William LeoGrande, a government professor at American University and an expert on the Cuban sanctions regime. “They haven’t brought about regime change. All they’ve done really is inflict pain on the Cuban people.”</p>

<p>The situation in Afghanistan may yet stand out as one of the deadliest instances of violence against civilians inflicted by U.S. sanctions. The Afghan government that was built over two decades of American occupation was created to be wholly dependent on foreign support, particularly its health care system. With the abrupt withdrawal of aid and the imposition of sanctions, millions of Afghans, including women and children, are now at risk.</p>
<p>More stories of starvation, death from the cold, and families broken apart by economic need are likely to result from the present approach of preventing access to funds owned by the Afghan government and denying aid. And it seems unlikely that such measures will do what 20 years of war could not: build a stable government that keeps the Taliban out of power.</p>

<p>Though sanctions on Afghanistan won’t achieve U.S. political aims, they are, as in so many other countries, succeeding in visiting cruel consequences upon the most vulnerable. House Democrats have called on Biden to release funds owned by Afghanistan&#8217;s central bank, but the administration has so far been resistant to this step. One reason could be that reversing course would reveal the brutality of the underlying policy — employing sanctions to deny foreign nations’ central banks access to their funds — which the U.S. government <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm780">continues to do in other cases</a>. Meanwhile, the broader sanctions regime on Afghanistan remains in place, with ordinary Afghans bearing the brunt.</p>
<p>“To help Afghanistan make progress on the humanitarian front, it is simply not enough to just give aid to Afghanistan. Washington’s financial warfare against the country must end,” wrote Giorgio Cafiero, CEO of Gulf State Analytics and an adjunct fellow at the American Security Project. “Those in the West who voiced so much concern about the lack of freedom for Afghan women under the Taliban ought to also care about their survival this winter.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>The U.S. government</u> has won its appeal of a British court ruling barring Julian Assange’s extradition on Espionage Act charges, setting the stage for the WikiLeaks founder to be sent to the U.S. to face trial. The decision handed down Friday morning reverses a previous conclusion that Assange would face unacceptable risks to his safety if held in the United States. A lower-court judge ruled in January that Assange would be at risk of suicide or other harm if held in American custody. But following reassurances by U.S. authorities that he would be held in the most strict confinement, a judge found that Assange can be extradited on the charges related to his publishing of classified State Department documents.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[0] -->
<p>Assange can still appeal the verdict, but the judgment by the court puts him at greater risk than ever of finding himself standing trial on charges that have alarmed press freedom advocates. In a <a href="https://defend.wikileaks.org/2021/12/10/high-court-decision-grave-miscarriage-of-justice-says-julian-assanges-fiancee/">statement</a> given after the ruling, Assange’s fiancée Stella Moris said that the ruling was “dangerous and misguided” and that U.S. assurances about the conditions of Assange’s confinement once stateside could not be considered reliable. Doctors have testified that Assange suffers from severe depression and other mental illnesses triggered by the years he has spent on the run from the U.S. government, and that he would be at grave risk of suicide if extradited to the U.S. The U.S. government has said that it might allow Assange to serve any future sentence in Australia, where he would face less restrictive confinement, but these assurances have been criticized by his supporters as vague and unreliable.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->
<p>The Biden administration has continued to press ahead with Assange’s indictment over his alleged role in assisting whistleblower Chelsea Manning to release thousands of State Department cables and other classified information in 2010 and 2011. The classified disclosures included thousands of documents outlining U.S. perceptions of foreign regimes and helped trigger major unrest in countries like Tunisia, where the 2011 revolution was <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/tunisia-and-wikileaks">spurred in part</a> by revelations of domestic corruption outlined in the documents. WikiLeaks also helped uncover evidence of civilian killings carried out by U.S. troops during the war in Iraq, including <a href="https://collateralmurder.wikileaks.org/">shocking video footage</a> of the crew of an Apache helicopter killing Reuters journalists and others during a 2007 attack in Baghdad.</p>
<p>In later years, Assange became a controversial figure in U.S. domestic politics due to his perceived support of Donald Trump and allegations that later WikiLeaks disclosures were aimed at helping ensure his victory in the 2016 election. But the Espionage Act charges he now faces stem from Manning’s classified disclosures, which provided a rich resource for journalists and activists around the world. The potential criminalization of a standard journalistic practice — the publication of classified documents provided by a source — has alarmed press freedom advocates.</p>
<p>“That United States prosecutors continued to push for this outcome is a betrayal of the journalistic principles the Biden administration has taken credit for celebrating,” Trevor Timm, executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said in a <a href="https://freedom.press/news/assange-extradition-from-united-kingdom-united-states-statement/">statement</a> decrying Friday&#8217;s verdict. “As brave whistleblowers have explained for decades, this kind of abuse of the Espionage Act against sources — and now journalists and publishers — is an embarrassment to basic ideals of justice and to core First Amendment values.”</p>
<p>The change from the Trump to Biden administration does not seem to have engendered any greater concern for the possible implications of Assange’s prosecution for acts of journalism. Assange’s fate remains unsettled, as his supporters, many of whom gathered in protest outside of the court following the verdict, have already indicated that he plans to appeal the decision. But the Biden administration appears set on continuing the persecution of Assange that has gone on for roughly a decade.</p>
<p>“Julian’s life is once more under grave threat, and so is the right of journalists to publish material that governments and corporations find inconvenient,” WikiLeaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson said. “This is about the right of a free press to publish without being threatened by a bullying superpower.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>A new report</u> by the independent monitoring group <a href="https://airwars.org/news-and-investigations/gaza-israel-syria-ewipa-report/">Airwars</a> found that the 2021 conflict between Israel and Palestinian factions in the Gaza Strip killed up to 192 Palestinian civilians and injured hundreds more over 11 days of intense fighting. Rockets fired by Palestinian militants into Israel are also estimated to have killed 10 civilians inside Israel during the brief but intense conflict first triggered by tensions between Israelis and Palestinians in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Among the key findings of the report — titled “Why Did They Bomb Us?” — are the age breakdowns of Palestinians killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza. Of the total number of civilian deaths, roughly one-third were children, most of whom died in attacks that killed or wounded multiple members of the same family. More than 70 percent of the reported attacks that killed civilians had no corresponding reports of militants hit alongside them, meaning that civilians were the only victims.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>One attack documented in the report took place the night of May 15, when an Israeli airstrike hit a house in the Al-Shati refugee camp in Gaza. Two mothers, sisters-in-law, were reportedly killed in the attack, along with eight children between the ages of 5 and 14. One 5-month-old boy was found by rescuers in the rubble from the attack still alive in his dead mother’s arms. The families had gathered together to celebrate the long weekend after the Eid holiday.</p>
<p>Alaa Abu Hattab, whose wife, children, sister, and sister’s children were all killed in the attack, recounted to Airwars what took place.</p>
<p>“I left my house on foot at about 1:30AM to go to some of the local shops that were open late during the run-up to Eid to buy toys and snacks for the kids for the Eid festival and to buy some food, as we were hungry,” Abu Hattab said in the report. Fifteen minutes later, an explosion hit the area he had just left. He ran back to find that it was his own home that had been struck. Seeing the rubble where his family house once stood, he fainted in shock. “When I regained consciousness, I saw rescue workers looking for bodies under the rubble and recovering body parts. The attack had shredded the bodies. Other parts remained under the rubble because they could not find them.”</p>
<p>No militants were reported killed in the strike, one of many that hit the strip during the brief fighting. “There were no militants in or near my house and no rockets or rocket launchers there,” Abu Hattab told Airwars. “I still don’t know why they bombed my house and killed my wife and children and my sister and her children.”</p>

<p>In addition to providing details on the civilian impact of the last war in Gaza, the Airwars report also provides the first comprehensive review of the long-running Israeli air campaign in Syria. Civilian casualties in Israel’s air campaign in Syria, mostly targeting alleged Iranian and Hezbollah assets, have been light, particularly in comparison with U.S., Russian, and Syrian government aerial attacks there that have killed tens of thousands of people. An estimated 14 to 40 civilians have been killed across hundreds of Israeli strikes against air bases, troop convoys, and weapons stores since 2013, according to Airwars findings.</p>

<p>The relative precision of Israel&#8217;s attacks in Syria stands in stark contrast to the toll of its operations in Gaza. According to the report, more civilians were killed in Gaza during the fighting this summer than in all of the attacks that have been carried out in Syria over the past eight years. The staggering difference between civilian harm in the two campaigns raises “fundamental questions about targeting policies,” according to the report. Israeli strikes in Syria have largely taken place away from built-up civilian areas, whereas the Gaza Strip is one of the most densely populated regions on the planet — making the nature of the Israeli campaign there something closer to counterinsurgency carried out from the skies.</p>

<p>In response to questions about its targeting practices during the 11-day Gaza conflict, an Israel Defense Forces spokesperson told Airwars that “terror organizations in the Gaza Strip deliberately embed their military assets in densely populated civilian areas,&#8221; adding that the IDF conducted internal operational reviews of its strikes and that the findings from those reports were classified. In response to similar questions about its attacks on Israel, a Hamas spokesperson stated that “[Israeli] military compounds and security facilities are built inside big cities and near universities and near hospitals,” claiming that the group similarly issued warnings in the hours before it carried out its attacks and took steps to ensure that its operations complied with international law.</p>

<p>The Airwars report is only the latest in a series from the monitoring organization on the civilian toll of various air campaigns in the Middle East and North Africa, including the U.S.-led coalition war against the Islamic State, Russian and Turkish airstrikes in Syria, and international operations in Libya. The study on Israeli and Palestinian militant activity is the first of its kind from the group.</p>
<p>“Our latest study corroborates what we have found with other large-scale conflicts in Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere: Even technologically advanced militaries kill large numbers of civilians when attacks focus on urban centers,” Airwars Director Chris Woods said about the report. “Stark differences in civilian deaths and injuries from Israeli actions in Syria and in the Gaza Strip clearly illustrate that the most significant driver of civilian harm remains the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. The single most effective way to reduce the number of civilians dying in warfare would be to restrict the use of such dangerous wide-area effect weapons.”</p>
