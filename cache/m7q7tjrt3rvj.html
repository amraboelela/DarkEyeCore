<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> Margaret Thatcher&#039;s counter-argument on the increasing wage cap is that while the income gap between the richest and the poorest might have increased, the overall income of the poorest has in fact increased. She continues to argue that socialism in its zeal to make everyone equal has the effect of dragging everyone down, both the poor and the rich alike. In fact, she claims that the opposing party would rather have the rich being poorer even if the poorest would be even poorer perhaps highlighting that class struggle is built on an irrational thought of a vendetta where a class would be penalized regardless whether the punishment would be to the detriment of the other class. Thatcher goes on to demonstrate with her fingers and claims that socialism would rather narrow the gap between the rich and the poor even if it would mean that the level at which both the rich and poor are to be found would sink compared to the current system,</div>

Therefrom it trivially follows that by making a society overall poorer (ie: the rich and the middle class), one should do so since it would favor the worst off group in society; unless, via the Rawls principle of priority, the actions performed would abridge political liberties (ie: abolishing free speech if it would benefit the worst off class).</div>

Explained allegorically by William Forster Lloyd in an essay using grazing pastures as the common and unregulated good and cow herders fighting over the common good and for each additional animal that a cow herder would add to the pasture it might end up in overgrazing such that the other herders would share the resulting damage. If all cattle herders would take the decision to be greedy and add additional animals, then the common good would be depleted to the determent of all.

</p>

<p>
Broadly as a hallmark of communist countries, yet pertaining to post-communist countries in the Balkans, countries such as France or even the US, the concept of political psychiatry can be defined as the abuse of psychiatry as a tool of repression of individuals used by the state in circumstances where people, that must be silenced or have their freedoms restricted, have not broken the law and cannot be put through court or trialed.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, by association, the state employs harassment that would drive a person to be distressed at which point psychiatry can be leveraged on a broad spectrum to pin a psychological condition on the person in order to facilitate the suppression of their freedoms and specifically to be deemed unfit for trial.
</p>

<p>
In brief, political psychiatry represents a state mechanism through which people can be steamrolled from freedom to jail whilst relieving the state from the burden of proof.
</p>

<p>
Contrary to <a href="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/fuss/philosophy/thinkers/michael_foucault" class="wikilink1" title="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:michael_foucault" data-wiki-id="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:michael_foucault">Foucault&#039;s criticism of the psychiatric institutions</a>, the abuse is in a political context seen as being deliberate and political rather than resulting from the implicit application of a scientific or medical perspective.
</p>

</div>

<h1 class="sectionedit4" id="the_bodyguard_phenomenon">The Bodyguard Phenomenon</h1>
<div class="level1">

<p>
Pertaining mainly to Russia, the Balkans but also in Western countries such as the US yet in a more sophisticated form, the bodyguard phenomenon can be defined as the replacement of the police by other commercial law and order solutions such as the hiring of bodyguards. More predominantly pertaining the Eastern countries, commercial law and order solutions such as bodyguards can sometimes be omnipresent on the street and meant to protect businesses and irrespective of the state-endorsed police.
</p>

<p>
The Eastern rationale behind the phenomenon can range from generalized corruption or incompetence of the police that cannot guarantee safety of property in very weak states. Conversely, the Western rationale consists in retired personnel from the military forces that find no other job after being discharged from service and hence end up in commercial law enforcement.
</p>

<p>
A connection could be drawn to <a href="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/fuss/philosophy/thinkers/robert_nozick" class="wikilink1" title="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:robert_nozick" data-wiki-id="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:robert_nozick">Nozick&#039;s watchman state</a> where the state relinquishes its monopoly on violence and delegates authority to the private sector yet the bodyguard phenomenon seems more linked to abuse of power or an overreach of authority where commercial law and order solutions can be held less accountable than the police and do not necessarily have to follow legal procedure.
</p>

</div>

<h1 class="sectionedit5" id="the_prison_industry">The Prison Industry</h1>
<div class="level1">

<p>
Specifically pertaining to the United States, the term &quot;prison industry&quot; refers to the delegation of prisons from the state to the private sector along with state-provided tax cuts, exemptions and other state subventions that, contrary to the defined purpose of a re-educational institution, result in the patrons of the private prisons to be motivated more by the retention of prisoners than their re-education.

<div class="level1">

&quot;The Great Resignation&quot; is recycling the slogan of the past economic crisis of 2007-2008 and is attributed to Anthony Klotz that predicted a mass quitting during the pandemic early in May 2021. The general consensus is that due to governmental restrictions during the pandemic, wage stagnation and rising cost of living, people have opted to resign their jobs in order to pursue other endeavors. 
</p>

<p>
The former is confirmed mainly by the statistics governing resignations in the United States that shows an abrupt decrease in resignations at the peak of the pandemic followed by a massive increase of resignations after the peak of the pandemic in the first economic quarter of 2020. Anthony Klotz, being a professor of management, additionally argues that more and more people have opted to work remotely during and after the pandemic since working remotely, whilst leveraging the advances in technology, tends to work for the benefit of the employer, for instance, by reducing maintenance costs as well as providing an employee with a more flexible lifestyle.

<p>
Even though most of the articles that discuss &quot;the great resignation&quot; sometimes provide a short graph that highlights the abrupt cease of resignations followed closely by an abrupt climb of resignations after the peak of the pandemic in 2020, the articles fail to provide a broader view of the resignations.

<p>
In reality, &quot;the great resignation&quot; seems to have been an ongoing event since the economic crash back in 2007-2008 since whence the rate of resignations had been steadily climbing. It is true that post-pandemic, an even higher slope can be observed however that would make the pandemic to only be a catalyst and not one of the ground reasons for &quot;the great resignation&quot;.

<h3 class="sectionedit10" id="the_pitch-counter-pitch_for_remote_work">The Pitch-Counter-Pitch for Remote Work</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
A case against working remotely could be brought up, inspired by the notion of the <a href="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/fuss/politics#the_social_contract" class="wikilink1" title="fuss:politics" data-wiki-id="fuss:politics">&quot;social contract&quot;</a>, where an employer could claim longer working hours implicitly due to the &quot;relaxed work schedule&quot; and would thereby achieve the opposite effect of counter-intuitively making employees work more instead of less. 
</p>

<p>
It is traditionally the case in the US, or any other highly bureaucratic country, that the work place is kept separate from private life such that blurring the line between the notions of &quot;workplace&quot; and &quot;home&quot; could give rise to many issues such as lack of privacy, overworking or working for a longer period of time cumulatively when accounting for, say, a more segmented time schedule as well as potentially being a vessel for isolationism due to the lack of competitive social contact. A conservative American might state that: &quot;I do not want my workplace to be a lifestyle, I want to go in at a certain hour, as per my contract, do work for the amount of time agreed upon and then go home and never hear about the workplace again until the next day when I have a contractual obligation to be there!&quot; As emphatically emphasised in the previous statement, a contract tends to demarcate private life from work such that work itself could become a lifestyle instead of a mutually agreed upon and demarcated duty of parts.
</p>

<p>
When accounting for the aforementioned pitfalls, it could very well be that working remotely could benefit just the employer that would just leverage the employee&#039;s sense of familiarity with the home environment in order to make employees work more. In any case, the conclusion does not seem too new since progressive work environments at large companies (ie: Google) have had a tendency of going to great managerial strides to ensure that employees feel &quot;at home&quot; while they are in the office based on the premise that familiarity and comfort leads to larger productivity.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, at the time of writing, it should be mentioned that almost all media outlets and all media pieces that have been published either on high or low frequencies seem to converge to the conclusion that working remotely is no less than fabulous. It seems that working remotely is a global pitch such that it should be approached with great caution whilst minding the previous potential pitfalls.

<div class="level1">

<p>
Constructed historically by Locke, <a href="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/fuss/philosophy/thinkers/thomas_hobbes" class="wikilink1" title="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:thomas_hobbes" data-wiki-id="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:thomas_hobbes">Hobbes</a> and <a href="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/fuss/philosophy/thinkers/jean-jacques_rousseau" class="wikilink1" title="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:jean-jacques_rousseau" data-wiki-id="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:jean-jacques_rousseau">Rousseau</a>, the generalizing idea is that in order to form a state, a community of individuals relinquish some authority and delegate powers to the state in exchange for certain tasks that the state would accomplish on their behalf. Some philosophers, such as Locke and Hobbes mainly discuss authority, and absolute authority once the social contract has been established, Rousseau touches on the subject of authority in relation to slavery but tends to talk more about empowering the individual.
</p>

<p>
Broadly seen, in modern times, the social contract can be seen as a mutual agreement between an individual and the state that describes their relationship in all public matters. In modern times, where the concept of authority appears more refined and provided that a state benefits from an exchange currency, the payment of taxes from the individual to the state can be seen as part of the social contract where the state is supposed to collect the taxes and use them for public benefit.

<h1 class="sectionedit12" id="socialism_for_the_rich_and_capitalism_for_the_poor">Socialism for The Rich and Capitalism for The Poor</h1>
<div class="level1">

<p>
The phrase is originally credited to Michael Harrington and it is used to describe a stage in advanced capitalist countries where allegedly the tendency is to facilitate wealth for the rich rather than the poor. Michael Harrington&#039;s thesis is based on an analysis of poverty in his book &quot;The Other America&quot; where he takes the unique approach to disconsider the official definition of poverty but rather to account instead for social factors, race and overall quality of life. For instance, Harrington accounts for &quot;the working poor&quot; as an effigy of people being employed but struggling to break even whilst implicitly also accounting for the lack of upward mobility. Similarly, Harrington contests the official US rate of unemployment by arguing that the allowed percentage does not account for temporary workers, disadvantaged workers, etc.
</p>

<p>
The phrase is also known as:

</ul>

<p>
Both systems do not undermine the will of the people, nor are they in contradiction but the main difference is that in a republic the people govern through elect officials rather than directly which could lead to the belief that a republic denotes an organizational decree whereas democracy is more broad and idealistic.

Nevertheless a police force as in its ulterior and more modern embodyment as described by <a href="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/fuss/philosophy/thinkers/michael_foucault" class="wikilink1" title="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:michael_foucault" data-wiki-id="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:michael_foucault">Michael Foucault</a> as an institution of control where the police force behaved more proactively than reactively can more or less trace its roots in the foundations of social order due to its historical evolution. Historically, whether that meant the securization of property, the round up of slaves in the US, the quelling of unions (or the direct involvement in the organization of labor), the peacekeeping between nationalistic or race-based &quot;silo&quot; communities the modern police force ended up being less influenced by a monarch (&quot;men of the king&quot;) and more of a force being controlled by the layers of society that had the sufficient political leverage to sway the use of force within the state. 
</p>

<p>
It is unclear why or when exactly the transition from a reactive police to a proactive police has been made but the reason is generally traced to the aforementioned historical events. 
</p>

<p>
Due to the former, from a generalized perspective and according to some, the modern police force traces its purpose down to class segregation rather than being the embodiment of the nightwatchmen state and are even less-so tasked with the protection of the people at large (ie: even those without &quot;property&quot;) but rather tasked with the enforcement of class bounds.

</p>

<p>
Tracing its roots to the Greek word <em>&quot;polis&quot;</em> meaning city, one of the fundamental class demarcations in ancient times was made both in Greece as in the Roman empire between the inhabitants of cities and the people living outside the city. The life outside the city was deemed to be under the <em>rule of force</em> whilst the life inside the city was deemed to be under the <em>rule of the law</em> and scholars argue that both are mutually exclusive. In contemporaneous history, some argue abstractly that people have managed to overall become part of &quot;the city&quot; and thus should be governed by the <em>rule of law</em> instead of by the <em>rule of force</em> - which, in shorter wording, leads to a desire to abolish the police in favor of the return to the nightwatchman minimal state.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, given that the police would be locally selected and given minimal tasks such as bring perpetrators before court, <a href="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/fuss/philosophy/thinkers/alexis_de_tocquerville" class="wikilink1" title="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:alexis_de_tocquerville" data-wiki-id="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:alexis_de_tocquerville">Tocqueville&#039;s concerns on the tyranny of the majority</a> could become an a serious concern in a nightwatchman state. In effect, a layer of separation of concern, or powers, would be removed between the people and the state, effectively blending the two together and could lead to an even larger government than intended. A police force that does not benefit from a degree of independence, or does not have the neutrality of a non-local form of government, could lead to proverbial mob rule and witch hunts.

The concept was first formulated by Walter Lipmann in <em>&quot;Public Opinion&quot;</em> 1922 and by <a href="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/fuss/philosophy/thinkers/edward_louis_bernays" class="wikilink1" title="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:edward_louis_bernays" data-wiki-id="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:edward_louis_bernays">Edward Bernays</a> in his work <em>&quot;Crystalizing Public Opinion&quot;</em>. <a href="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/fuss/philosophy/thinkers/sheldon_wolin" class="wikilink1" title="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:sheldon_wolin" data-wiki-id="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:sheldon_wolin">Sheldon Wolin</a> expanded on the notion of guided democracy by introducing the concept of inverted totalitarianism.
</p>

<p>
A managed democracy is a formally-democratic government that functions as a defacto autocracy. The government controls elections and the state apparatus such that citizens are able to formally exercise their democratic rights but without being able to change the inner workings of the state. On the outside, the state appears to be a democracy or at least it is self-defined as a democracy yet due to the accumulation of power or wealth that is hoarded at the upper echelons of society, the power of the individual and the populace at large is diminished to the point of being irrelevant or at least insufficient for political change to take place.

Even though most often found in the context of US politics due to the two party system, political polarization describes the tendency of groups to isolate themselves from other groups and to concentrate power within the group rather than cooperating and relying on other groups. Perhaps the idea of political polarization can be derived from more general group dynamics such as <a href="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/fuss/philosophy/thinkers/pierre_bourdieu" class="wikilink1" title="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:pierre_bourdieu" data-wiki-id="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:pierre_bourdieu">Pierre Bourdieu</a>&#039;s field theory that describes the interaction between individuals and the group as well as between groups of individuals by following <a href="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/fuss/philosophy/thinkers/antonio_gramsci" class="wikilink1" title="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:antonio_gramsci" data-wiki-id="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:antonio_gramsci">Antonio Gramsci</a>&#039;s idea of cultural hegemony.

Contrary to the theory of polarization, <a href="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/fuss/philosophy/thinkers/sheldon_wolin" class="wikilink1" title="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:sheldon_wolin" data-wiki-id="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:sheldon_wolin">Sheldon Wolin</a> would argue that the two-party system is expressed only nominatively and that in practical reality both parties tend to follow a pattern of lowest-common-denominator conservative thought. Wolin argues, on the basis that the coalescing of state powers leads to fascism, that the meld between the opposition and the currently governing party leads to the lack of political alternatives, especially concerning true voter freedoms that are able to bring about real political change.
</p>

<p>
Note that polarization does not necessarily entail nor imply a two-party system even though &quot;polarization&quot; is seen physically as an expression of opposites. Following <a href="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/fuss/philosophy/thinkers/pierre_bourdieu" class="wikilink1" title="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:pierre_bourdieu" data-wiki-id="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:pierre_bourdieu">Pierre Bourdieu</a>&#039;s thesis on field theory, it is possible to generalize polarization from a <img src="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=wiki:latex:/img76c5792347bb90ef71cfbace628572cf.png" class="latex_inline" alt="$2$" title="Math" />-party system to an <img src="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=wiki:latex:/img55a049b8f161ae7cfeb0197d75aff967.png" class="latex_inline" alt="$n$" title="Math" />-party system where very much the same issues would prevail yet in a more complex fashion. One example thereof would be a classical three-party system prevalent in Europe between the right, the left and the green party (mostly said to be left-leaning). 
</p>

<p>
Ultimately, arguing in Wolin&#039;s terms of choices and expanding, a two party system polarization provides <img src="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=wiki:latex:/img76c5792347bb90ef71cfbace628572cf.png" class="latex_inline" alt="$2$" title="Math" /> choices (between two parties), a three party system provides <img src="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=wiki:latex:/img5dc642f297e291cfdde8982599601d7e.png" class="latex_inline" alt="$3$" title="Math" /> choices (between three parties) and, by induction, an <img src="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=wiki:latex:/img55a049b8f161ae7cfeb0197d75aff967.png" class="latex_inline" alt="$n$" title="Math" />-party polarized system would provide <img src="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=wiki:latex:/img55a049b8f161ae7cfeb0197d75aff967.png" class="latex_inline" alt="$n$" title="Math" /> alternative choices. It is clear that the entailing bureaucracy increases as the number of parties increases such that the atomization of every single choice down to their basic counterparts would be, in common terms, at least impractical and at best a total democracy. In fact, Wolin does mention alternative democracies where the voter base is granted the ability to make a more atomic choice about the governance by extending elections to various seats within the government and not narrowing the selection down to just two choices.

<h1 class="sectionedit20" id="political_allegiance_by_search_engine_◬">Political Allegiance by Search Engine (◬)</h1>
<div class="level1">

<p>
One deep-magic Internet trope revolves around determining the extent of freedom of information of a given Internet search engine by going to the images section and looking up the phrase <em>tiananmen square</em>. When the image results appear, there are two possible outcomes (or a mix of both):
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> images of the Tiananmen square massacre dominate the search results,</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> iff. images of the Tiananmen square massacre are dominant then the search engine is said to be free or impartial,</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level1 node"><div class="li"> photos of the Tiananmen square itself in China dominate the search results,</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> iff. photos of the square are dominant the the search engine is said to be biased towards Chinese politics</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The validity of the thesis hinges primarily on the fact that the &quot;man with shopping bags blocking the tank&quot; (tank man) is an image that has become over the years a well-established trope symbolizing the resistance of the individual against the state. Therefrom, it is assumed that any impartial search engine would provide the image of the man blocking the path of the tanks as one of the first images due to its overwhelming popularity contrasted with the popularity of just random photos of the Tiananmen square itself. Furthermore, up to this date, &quot;Tank Man&quot; remains censored in China which tends to give credence to the search engine bias thesis.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/_detail/fuss/fuss_politics_tiananmen_square_man_blocking_tank.png?id=fuss%3Apolitics" class="media" title="fuss:fuss_politics_tiananmen_square_man_blocking_tank.png"><img src="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/_media/fuss/fuss_politics_tiananmen_square_man_blocking_tank.png?w=512&amp;tok=e0f044" class="media" alt="" width="512" /></a>
</p>

<p>
Note that the thesis is different from the formal, as formal as it may be, narrative that suggests that the search terms would have originally been <em>&quot;tank man&quot;</em> instead of <em>&quot;tiananmen square&quot;</em>. The drama concerning the <em>&quot;tank man&quot;</em> search terms has already been thoroughly debated, a shameless citation of Wikipedia permitting:
</p>

<p>
<em>&quot;On June 4, 2021, the 32nd anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, searches for the Tank Man image and videos were censored by Microsoft&#039;s Bing search engine worldwide. Hours after Microsoft acknowledged the issue, the search returned only pictures of tanks elsewhere in the world. Search engines that license results from Microsoft such as DuckDuckGo and Yahoo faced similar issues. Microsoft said the issue was &quot;due to an accidental human error&quot;. The director of Human Rights Watch, Kenneth Roth, said he found the idea it was an inadvertent error &quot;hard to believe&quot;. David Greene, Civil Liberties Director at Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that content moderation was impossible to do perfectly and &quot;egregious mistakes are made all the time&quot;, but he further elaborated that &quot;At worst, this was purposeful suppression at the request of a powerful state.&quot;</em>
</p>

<p>
Whilst it seems that the search term <em>&quot;tank man&quot;</em> has indeed been adressed by Microsoft, the search term <em>&quot;tiananmen square&quot;</em> still yields random photos of the Tiananmen square and not the overly popular tank man amongst the first search results.
</p>

<p>
Whether the claim is true or false, and hence marked on this page with the special symbol ◬, it is interesting that various search engines display dramatically different image results.

<div class="level1">

<p>
Ultimately a <a href="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/fuss/philosophy/thinkers/georg_wilhelm_friedrich_hegel" class="wikilink1" title="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:georg_wilhelm_friedrich_hegel" data-wiki-id="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:georg_wilhelm_friedrich_hegel">Hegelian dialectic of thesis, anti-thesis and synthesis</a>, politics of continuity represent the movement of society as viewed from the perspective of various crises as the milestones of civic evolution. The concept is illustrated by Milton Friedman in the context of economics stating that <em>&quot;Only a crisis - actual or perceived - produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around.&quot;</em>. The same case, is made by <a href="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/fuss/philosophy/thinkers/david_harvey" class="wikilink1" title="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:david_harvey" data-wiki-id="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:david_harvey">David Harvey</a> stating that capitalism never solves its own problems but rather moves the problems around geographically. One of the fears of skeptics in modern political thought, for instance, as Hegel being paraphrased by David Icke &quot;problem, reaction, solution&quot; is that the entire Hegelian cycle of thesis, anti-thesis and synthesis might not be organic, as a natural evolution of thought, but rather a pre-synthesised or pre-conspired arrangement, that might not be representative of society as a whole, but rather leveraged as a device to push policy, that either would benefit only the very few, or a policy that has already stipulated in the idealistic sense.
</p>

<p>
In many ways, the politics of continuity pertaining to crises, particularly focusing public attention on disasters (ie: Naomi Klein&#039;s &quot;disaster capitalism&quot;), is contemptible in the sense that it precludes noteworthy major events (ie: scientific breakthroughs, noteworthy societal events) by diverting attention towards subjects that carry &quot;shock value&quot; such that human history and public recollection becomes a series or sequence of never-ending calamities strung together.

<h1 class="sectionedit23" id="the_right_to_fail_and_the_right_to_death">The Right to Fail and The Right to Death</h1>
<div class="level1">

<p>
In the Declaration of Independence in the United States, it is stated that <em>&quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&quot;</em> essentially stating the <a href="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/fuss/philosophy/thinkers/jean-jacques_rousseau" class="wikilink1" title="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:jean-jacques_rousseau" data-wiki-id="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:jean-jacques_rousseau">Rousseu</a>ian basis upon which human rights are built and in particular the observation that the right to &quot;life&quot;, &quot;liberty&quot; and &quot;the pursuit of Happiness&quot; are unalienable human rights. Aside from issues arising from the statement that &quot;the pursuit of Happiness&quot; is an unalienable human right, leading one to wonder whether that is <a href="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/fuss/legistics#negative_vs_positive_rights" class="wikilink1" title="fuss:legistics" data-wiki-id="fuss:legistics">a negative or positive right</a>, a different question that arises is whether the converse holds equally true.
</p>

<p>
Namely, is &quot;death&quot;, &quot;captivity&quot; and &quot;the pursuit of Unhappiness&quot; also unalienable and irrevocably negative rights? Although superficially contrarian at first, the &quot;right to death&quot; is subject of pertinent debate with regards to medical conditions bringing forth the notion of &quot;assisted suicide&quot;. Following the example in the same jurisdiction, the United States does not approve, at the federal level, of &quot;the right to death&quot; such that &quot;assisted suicide&quot; is not legal in the United States (and only partially legal in a handful of its member states). As it follows, it seems that &quot;death&quot;, &quot;captivity&quot; and &quot;the pursuit of Unhappiness&quot; are not universal unalienable human rights. In fact, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as stipulated by the United Nation, does not offer a follow-up clause that the converse of, for instance, &quot;life&quot; as would be &quot;death&quot;, as a human right. As it follows, it can be said that individuals have the right to their own life but yet do not hold the rights to their own death, where, for all practical scenarios, an individual&#039;s right to death is held or withheld by the state (as a monopoly on violence, now a monopoly on death). Nevertheless, <a href="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/fuss/philosophy/thinkers/john_stuart_mill" class="wikilink1" title="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:john_stuart_mill" data-wiki-id="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:john_stuart_mill">John Stuart Mill</a> makes the claim in &quot;On Liberty&quot; that &quot;[state intervention for] His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant.&quot; meaning that a libertarian society should not monopolize the right to death via the right to self-harm.
</p>

<p>
In a narrower sense, and culturally speaking, the &quot;right to fail&quot; as coined by <a href="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/_media/fuss/fuss_politics_zinsser_right_to_fail.pdf" class="media mediafile mf_pdf" title="fuss:fuss_politics_zinsser_right_to_fail.pdf (98.5 KB)">Zinsser</a> comes as a reply to the societal urge for individuals to succeed at all costs. The urge to succeed, as a desire for elitism, could be seen as the transformation of &quot;the right to Happiness&quot; from a negative into a positive right that is then imposed as an obligation on the individual - in other words, as it follows from the theory, as well as from all cultural or practical imperatives, one has the obligation to be happy. The obligation to be happy, or, rephrased in Zinsser&#039;s terms, the obligation to be &quot;successful&quot; in particular with relation to the welfare state, makes one wonder whether individuals have the right to their own existence. 
</p>

<p>
Recognizing the inability of modern societies to conceptualize &quot;failure&quot;, or willing to spin failure as the road to success, and borrowing the concept of &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; from <a href="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/fuss/philosophy/thinkers/alexis_de_tocquerville" class="wikilink1" title="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:alexis_de_tocquerville" data-wiki-id="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:alexis_de_tocquerville">Alexis de Tocquerville</a> it is often the case that societies become overzealous and tend to pro-actively <em>impose</em> success (or, following the theory, <em>impose</em> happiness) without even wanting to recognize the concept of unhappiness, strife, misery or failure as being a self-standing concept, or counter-intuitively to them, a set of unique albeit particular human desires. Indeed, <a href="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/fuss/philosophy/thinkers/alexis_de_tocquerville" class="wikilink1" title="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:alexis_de_tocquerville" data-wiki-id="fuss:philosophy:thinkers:alexis_de_tocquerville">de Tocquerville</a> argues that society tends to blanket cover all its extremities and favor some normative mediocrity yet theory would state that if and only if an individual holds the right to their own existence then both the &quot;right to life&quot; as well as &quot;the right to death&quot; must be satisfied.

<h1 class="sectionedit24" id="the_right_to_free_speech_vs_the_right_to_be_heard">The Right to Free Speech vs The Right to Be Heard</h1>
<div class="level1">

<p>
As per the 1st Amendment, the right to free speech is defined as: <em>&quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&quot;</em>
</p>

<p>
By the very definition alone, the Amendment does not describe the dynamics between individuals not related to the government (ie: congress) and only makes a statement on the dynamics between the state and the individual. The rule applies solely to Congress and does not suggest how individuals should exercise, suppress or quell their right to free speech (aside from mentioning that assemblies should be peaceful). 
</p>

<p>
In other words, the 1st Amendment alone makes the &quot;freedom of speech&quot; a <a href="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/fuss/legistics#negative_vs_positive_rights" class="wikilink1" title="fuss:legistics" data-wiki-id="fuss:legistics">negative right</a> contrasted to <em>&quot;the right to be heard&quot;</em> (that would be a <a href="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/fuss/legistics#negative_vs_positive_rights" class="wikilink1" title="fuss:legistics" data-wiki-id="fuss:legistics">positive right</a>) such that neither congress, nor third-parties, nor individuals, are dutifully bound to facilitate or in any way influence the right to &quot;free speech&quot;.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, it is important to realize that discussions on &quot;free speech&quot; are only relevant to states such as the E.U. or the U.S. that have the notion of &quot;free speech&quot; embedded either in their charter, respectively in their constitution and that it is trivially futile to reason about such notions in states or jurisdictions that do not embrace nor endorse the concept of free speech.
</p>

</div>

<h2 class="sectionedit25" id="examples">Examples</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
Two contemporary illustrative examples can be mentioned:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> the European Community actively suppressing &quot;free speech&quot; as a <em>negative right</em> by preventing E.U. citizens from accessing Russian news outlets,</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> the U.S. discussing the &quot;right to be heard&quot;, as a <em>positive right</em> by attempting to mediate fairness of privately owned (or publicly traded) social media platforms</div>
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h3 class="sectionedit26" id="european_union">European Union</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
During the Ukraine conflict (2022-) the European Union <a href="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/_media/fuss/fuss_politics_sanctions_on_kremlin-backed_outlets_european_community.pdf" class="media mediafile mf_pdf" title="fuss:fuss_politics_sanctions_on_kremlin-backed_outlets_european_community.pdf (42 KB)">decided to impose restrictions on several news outlets that have been deemed to be backed by the Russian government</a> in a fairly unprecedented event that would, in the context of free speech, represent a breach of the right to free speech of the citizens of the European Union as well as a breach of the European Union&#039;s own charter of rights. In effect, the European Union&#039;s ban only prevented Europeans from accessing certain news outlets, yet the very same outlets functioned the same way for other countries thereby punishing, in practice, only E.U. citizens.
</p>

<p>
The problem here is a violation of &quot;free speech&quot;, as a negative right, where the government actively suppresses free speech rather than the being a case of &quot;the right to be heard&quot; since the latter would only apply to the Russian news outlets and not the citizens of the E.U.
</p>

</div>

<h4 id="details">Details</h4>
<div class="level4">

<p>
Even though dystopian, the press release comes across as a decree without stipulating on what legal (or sensible) basis such a ban should take effect. For instance, assuming that a private broadcasting company strikes a deal with Russia Today or Sputnik (the news outlets mentioned by the E.U.) in the form of a legal contract, how would the E.U. (or any other authority for that matter), have the right, the legal means or even the logistic capability to render a private contract null and void - by extension, in case the E.U.-based private company finds itself in breach of contract, how would the E.U. proceed to compensate for losses? The E.U.-released press document mentions that &quot;all relevant licenses, authorizations and distribution arrangements are suspended&quot; and that, furthermore, &quot;The sanctions cover all means for transmission, distribution, such as via cable, satellite, IPTV, platforms, websites and apps.&quot; making any effective legal procedures effectively impossible given that &quot;all means for transmission&quot; are not to be found under the same European jurisdiction and hence cannot be regulated nor sanctioned by the E.U.. Nevertheless, in context, the E.U. decision taken on the 2nd of March 2022 is directly in breach of its own charter that states that <em>&quot;Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.&quot;</em> (repeating <em>&quot;without interference by public authority&quot;</em>).
</p>

<h3 class="sectionedit27" id="united_states">United States</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Social media platforms have come under the attention of the U.S. government perhaps starting with the &quot;Cambridge Analytica&quot; event in 2018 where Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook had a hearing in Congress. Since then, several social media platforms have been subject of great social debate particularly since they have been deemed (even symbolically, though Zuckerberg&#039;s invitation to Congress) to yield a significant amount of power. Nevertheless, most social media platforms are either privately owned or publicly traded (with private shareholders) such that moderation is implicitly solely at the discretion of the owners, shareholders and the individual management boards of the companies. There have been several strides to categorize such companies as public utilities yet issues could arise such as <a href="http://3wymlmcsvxiaqzmbepsdawqpk6o2qsk65jhms72qqjulk5u4bgmvs3qd.onion/fuss/politics#tragedy_of_the_commons" class="wikilink1" title="fuss:politics" data-wiki-id="fuss:politics">taxation</a> (ie: public goods are paid for by public money and not by private shareholders, leading to these social media platforms having to be funded by public taxpayer money) or the re-categorization could also be seen as a subtle form of nationalization.
</p>

<p>
The discussion leans towards <em>&quot;the right to be heard&quot;</em>, as a positive right, in the form of compulsory services offered by either governmental or non-governmental agencies that would facilitate various users and userbases to express themselves publicly, rather than <em>&quot;free speech&quot;</em>, as a negative right, that would only make sense in case the U.S. government is directly seeking (ie: via Congress) to suppress the rights of citizens to express themselves (which is not the case in this particular instance, ie: companies with private capital).
</p>

</div>

<h3 class="sectionedit28" id="details1">Details</h3>
<div class="level3">

<p>
Taking as an example president Donald Trump&#039;s ban from Twitter it seems trivial to observe that Twitter being a private company might have considered that it is in the best interest of their company as well as the best interest of the shareholders to ban the account. One could wounder how come prestigious U.S. presidents stoop so low as to publish minutia on a social media platform that is essentially just a product (one of many) and not really a formal or equally-prestigious way to address people. Similarly, one could argue that Twitter would have represented a good way to reach a wider audience such that Donald Trump&#039;s team leveraged that outreach for the campaign. Either way, and agreeing with both, it becomes clear that the issue here pertains more to &quot;the right to be heard&quot; rather than &quot;the right to free speech&quot;.
</p>

</div>

<h1 class="sectionedit29" id="a_trivial_solution_to_ideal_freedom_of_speech">A Trivial Solution to Ideal Freedom of Speech</h1>
<div class="level1">

<p>
The Oxford Dictionary defines &quot;free speech&quot; as: <em>&quot;the power or right to express one&#039;s opinions without censorship, restraint, or legal penalty&quot;</em>. From the definition it follows that in the absence of <em>censorship</em>, <em>restraint</em> and <em>legal penalty</em>, opinions are free to be expressed. 
</p>

<p>
Thus, in order to achieve idealistic free speech it should be insured (and hence demonstrable) that:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> &quot;censorship&quot; of the expressed opinions is not possible,</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> &quot;restraint&quot; (or fear of repercussions) cannot be applied on either the opinions or the subject uttering the opinions,</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> that &quot;legal penalty&quot; cannot be applied to the subject uttering the opinions.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
In order for &quot;restraint&quot; and &quot;legal penalty&quot; to not be possible, one trivial yet partial solution to the problem of &quot;free speech&quot; can be the implementation of a system that is demonstrably anonymous. For instance, a system that has been traditionally anonymous has been the secrecy of voter ballots (also known as the Australian ballot where the anonymity of the voters is preserved).
</p>

<p>
Due to &quot;anonymity&quot; resolving the issue of the fear of repercussions (&quot;restraint&quot;) as well as providing a safe harbor for &quot;legal penalty&quot; then the term &quot;censorship&quot; should, in context, only be interpreted as the &quot;ability to suppress&quot;. In order to be able to &quot;suppress&quot; speech, in broader terms, there must exist a central authority that is able to control the communication channels. One trivial solution, is the lack of a central authority, for instance, a decentralized system where no single actor, or group of actors, either involved or uninvolved in the communication (&quot;speech&quot;) has the technical capability to selectively collapse the communication channels.
</p>

<p>
In brief, an ideal concept of &quot;free speech&quot; would trivially require:
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> anonymity (eliminates &quot;fear of repercussions&quot; and &quot;legal penalty&quot;),</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> decentralization (eliminates &quot;censorship&quot;)</div>
</li>
</ul>
