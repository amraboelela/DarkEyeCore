A <a href="https://twitter.com/wesleysmorgan/status/1042243862943748097">127e program in Tunisia</a>, code-named Obsidian Tower, which has never been acknowledged by the Pentagon or previously identified as a use of the 127e authority, resulted in combat by U.S. forces alongside local surrogates in 2017, according to another set of documents obtained by The Intercept. A third document, a secret memo that was redacted and declassified for release to The Intercept, sheds light on hallmarks of the program, including use of the authority to provide access to areas of the world otherwise inaccessible even to the most elite U.S. troops.</p>
<p>The documents and interviews provide the most detailed picture yet of an obscure funding authority that allows American commandos to conduct counterterrorism operations “<a href="https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Maier%20APQ%20responses.pdf">by, with, and through</a>” foreign and irregular partner forces around the world. Basic information about these missions — <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/TE/TE10044">where</a> they are conducted, their frequency and targets, and the foreign forces the U.S. relies on to carry them out — are unknown even to most members of relevant congressional committees and key State Department personnel.</p></div><blockquote class="Pullquote Pullquote--right" data-reactid="203"><span class="Pullquote-line" data-reactid="204"></span><div data-reactid="205">“If someone were to call a 127-echo program a proxy operation, it would be hard to argue with them.”</div></blockquote><div data-reactid="206"><p>Through 127e, the U.S. arms, trains, and provides intelligence to foreign forces. But unlike traditional foreign assistance programs, which are primarily intended to build local capacity, 127e partners are then dispatched on U.S.-directed missions, targeting U.S. enemies to achieve U.S. aims. “The foreign participants in a 127-echo program are filling gaps that we don&#8217;t have enough Americans to fill,” a former senior defense official involved with the program told The Intercept. “If someone were to call a 127-echo program a proxy operation, it would be hard to argue with them.”</p>
<p>Retired generals with intimate knowledge of the 127e program — known in military parlance as “127-echo” — say that it is extremely effective in targeting militant groups while reducing risk to U.S. forces. But experts told The Intercept that use of the little-known authority raises grave accountability and oversight concerns and potentially violates the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>One of the documents obtained by The Intercept puts the cost of 127e operations between 2017 and 2020 at $310 million, a fraction of U.S. military spending over that time period but a significant increase from the $25 million budget allocated to the program when it was first authorized, under a different name, <a href="https://tjaglcspublic.army.mil/documents/27431/13299844/2020-Issue-1-Funding+Surrogate+Forces+in+the+Fight+Against+Terrorism.pdf/1017528c-ed0d-4bbe-ac38-95186e3d63d9">in 2005</a>.</p></div><div class="PhotoGrid PhotoGrid--2-column PhotoGrid--xtra-large" data-reactid="207"><div class="PhotoGrid-rows" data-reactid="208"><div class="PhotoGrid-row PhotoGrid-row--2-of-2" data-reactid="209"><div class="PhotoGrid-cell PhotoGrid-cell--1" data-reactid="210"><img class="PhotoGrid-photo" alt="127e-program-chart-theintercept-1" src="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/wp-uploads/sites/1/2022/06/127e-program-chart-theintercept-1-955x1024.png" data-reactid="211"/></div><div class="PhotoGrid-cell PhotoGrid-cell--2" data-reactid="212"><img class="PhotoGrid-photo" alt="127e-program-chart-theintercept-2-1" src="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/wp-uploads/sites/1/2022/07/127e-program-chart-theintercept-2-1-955x1024.png" data-reactid="213"/></div></div></div><p class="PhotoGrid-description" data-reactid="214"><span class="PhotoGrid-description-caption" data-reactid="215">Source: Pentagon documents and former officials.</span><span class="PhotoGrid-description-credit" data-reactid="216">Graphics: Soohee Cho for The Intercept</span></p></div><div data-reactid="217"><p>While critics contend that, due to a lack of oversight, 127e programs risk involving the United States in human rights abuses and entangling the U.S. in foreign conflicts unbeknownst to Congress and the American people, former commanders say the 127e authority is crucial to combating terrorism.</p>

Asked for a general comment about the utility of the 127e authority and its role in the administration&#8217;s counterterrorism strategy, Patrick Evans, a National Security Council spokesperson, replied: “These all fall under the Department of Defense.” The Pentagon and Special Operations Command refuse to comment on the 127e authority. “We do not provide information about 127e programs because they are classified,” SOCOM spokesperson Ken McGraw told The Intercept.</p>
<p>Critics of 127e warn that in addition to the risk of unanticipated military escalation and the potential costs of engaging in up to a dozen conflicts around the world, some operations may amount to an unlawful use of force. Because most members of Congress — including those directly responsible for overseeing foreign affairs — have no input and little visibility into where and how the programs are run, 127e-related hostilities can lack the congressional authorization required by the U.S. Constitution, argued Katherine Ebright, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice.</p>
<p>“There’s reason to suspect the Department of Defense has used 127e partners to engage in combat beyond the scope of any authorization for use of military force or permissible self-defense,” Ebright told The Intercept, noting substantial confusion at the Pentagon and in Congress over a stipulation that 127e programs support only authorized ongoing military operations. “That kind of unauthorized use of force, even through partners rather than U.S. soldiers themselves, would contravene constitutional principles.”</p></div><div class="img-wrap align-center width-fixed" style="width:1024px;" data-reactid="271"><div data-reactid="272"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-401127" src="//theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2022/06/22096119_1262111187226771_298605369197715840_o-2.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90&w=1024&h=652" alt="22096119_1262111187226771_298605369197715840_o-2" />

<p>The origins of the 127e program can be traced back to the earliest days of the U.S. war in Afghanistan, as commandos and CIA personnel sought to support the Afghan Northern Alliance in its fight against the Taliban. Army Special Operations Command soon realized that it lacked the authority to provide direct payments to its new proxies and was forced to rely on CIA funding. This prompted a <a href="https://civiliansinconflict.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CIVIC_US_Report_Drones_Final.pdf">broader push by SOCOM</a> to secure the ability to support foreign forces in so-called missions, a military corollary to the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/12/18/afghanistan-cia-militia-01-strike-force/">CIA’s use of militia surrogates</a>. First known as Section 1208, the authority was also deployed in the early years of the Iraq invasion, according to a former senior defense official. It was ultimately enshrined in U.S. law under U.S.C. Title 10 § 127e.</p>
<p>127e is one of several virtually unknown authorities granted to the Defense Department by Congress over the last two decades that allow U.S. commandos to conduct operations on the fringes of war and with minimal outside oversight. While 127e focuses on “counterterrorism,” other authorities allow elite forces — Navy SEALs, Army Green Berets, and Marine Raiders among them — to conduct clandestine <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/127f">intelligence and counterintelligence operations</a> or assist foreign forces in <a href="https://irp.fas.org/doddir/dod/dtm-18-005.pdf">irregular warfare</a>, primarily in the context of so-called great power competition. In April, top Special Operations officials unveiled a new “<a href="https://www.socom.mil/Pages/SOF-Vision-and-Strategy.aspx">Vision and Strategy</a>” framework that appears to endorse continued reliance on the 127e concept by leveraging “burden sharing partnerships to achieve objectives within an acceptable level of risk.”</p></div><!-- react-empty: 274 --><div data-reactid="275"><p>Gen. Richard D. Clarke, the current Special Operations commander, <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/AP/AP02/20190409/109281/HHRG-116-AP02-Wstate-ClarkeR-20190409.pdf">testified before Congress</a> in 2019 that 127e programs “directly resulted in the capture or killing of thousands of terrorists, disrupted terrorist networks and activities, and denied terrorists operating space across a wide range of operating environments, at a fraction of the cost of other programs.”</p>
<p>Clarke’s claims cannot be verified. A SOCOM spokesperson told The Intercept that the command does not have figures on those captured or killed during 127e missions. It is also not known how many foreign forces and civilians have been killed in these operations, but a former defense official confirmed to The Intercept that there have been U.S. casualties, even as U.S. troops are traditionally expected to stay behind “<a href="https://www.stimson.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CIVIC_US_Report_ETR-FINAL1.pdf">last cover and concealment</a>” during a foreign partner’s operations.</p>
<p>The documents obtained by The Intercept tout the importance of the authority, particularly in providing U.S. special operators a way into difficult-to-access areas. According to a memo, one 127e program provided “the only human physical access to areas,” with local partners “focused on finding, fixing, and finishing” enemy forces. Another 127e program targeting Al Qaeda and its affiliates similarly allowed commandos to project “combat power into previously-inaccessible VEO [violent extremist organization] safe havens.”</p></div><div class="img-wrap align-center width-fixed" style="width:1024px;" data-reactid="276"><div data-reactid="277"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-401108" src="//theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2022/06/160823-O-TJ882-001-2.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=90&w=1024&h=683" alt="160823-O-TJ882-001-2" />

<p>While the documents obtained by The Intercept offer clues about the scope and contours of the 127e program, much remains unknown to both the public and members of Congress. Relevant reports required by law are classified at a level that prevents most congressional staffers from accessing them. A government official familiar with the program, who<strong> </strong>requested anonymity to discuss it, estimated that only a handful of people on Congress’s armed services and intelligence committees read such reports. Congressional foreign affairs and relations committees — even though they have primary responsibility for deciding where the U.S. is at war<b> </b>and can use force — do not receive them. And most congressional representatives and staff with clearance to access the reports do not know to ask for them. “It’s true that any member of Congress could read any of these reports, but I mean, they don&#8217;t even know they exist,” the government official added. “It was designed to prevent oversight.”</p>
<p>But it is not just Congress that’s largely kept in the dark about the program: Officials at the State Department with the relevant expertise are also often unaware. While 127e requires signoff by the chief of mission in the country where the program is carried out, detailed information is rarely shared by those diplomats with officials in Washington.</p></div><blockquote class="Pullquote Pullquote--left" data-reactid="289"><span class="Pullquote-line" data-reactid="290"></span><div data-reactid="291">“DOD views this as a small, tiny program that doesn’t have foreign policy implications, so, ‘Let’s just do it. The less people get in our way, the easier.’”</div></blockquote><div data-reactid="292"><p>The lack of oversight across levels of the U.S. government is in part the result of the extreme secrecy with which defense officials have shielded their authority over the program — and of the scant pushback they have faced. “It’s State not knowing what they don’t know, so they don’t even know to ask. It’s the ambassadors being sort of wowed by these four-star generals who come in and say, ‘If you don’t let us do this, everyone’s going to die,’” the government official said. “DOD views this as a small, tiny program that doesn’t have foreign policy implications, so, ‘Let’s just do it. The less people get in our way, the easier.’”</p>
<p>Sarah Harrison, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group and formerly associate general counsel at the Defense Department’s Office of General Counsel, International Affairs, echoed that assessment. “HASC and SASC appear opposed to increasing oversight of 127-echo. They are not inclined to change the statute to strengthen State’s oversight, nor are they adequately sharing documents related to the program with personal [congressional] staff,” she said, using the acronyms of the House Armed Services Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee. “This may seem like an arcane, bureaucratic issue, but it really matters for oversight of the 127-echo program and all other programs that are run in secret.”</p>
<p>Those programs include an authority, known as <a href="https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dtm/DTM-18-005.pdf?ver=2020-08-11-152602-477">Section </a><a href="https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dtm/DTM-18-005.pdf?ver=2020-08-11-152602-477">1202</a>, that first appeared in the <a href="https://civiliansinconflict.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CIVIC_US_Report_Drones_Final.pdf">2018 National Defense Authorization Act</a> and provides “support to foreign forces, <a href="https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dtm/DTM-18-005.pdf?ver=2020-08-11-152602-477">irregular forces</a>, groups, or individuals” that are taking part in irregular warfare and are explicitly focused on so-called near-peer competitors. Congress has also authorized the secretary of defense to “expend up to $15,000,000 in any fiscal year for clandestine activities for any purpose the Secretary determines to be proper for preparation of the environment for operations of a confidential nature” under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/127f">10 USC § 127f</a>, or “127 foxtrot.” <a href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/Downloads/IE/NDAA%2020%20PLAW-116publ92.pdf">Section 1057 authority</a> similarly allows for intelligence and counterintelligence activities in response to threats of a “confidential, extraordinary, or emergency nature.”</p>
<p>“This has been sort of the story for a lot of these DOD-run programs,” said Stephen Semler, co-founder of the Security Policy Reform Institute, a grassroots-funded U.S. foreign policy think tank. “The Special Operations community likes autonomy a lot. They don&#8217;t like going through bureaucracy, so they always invent authorities, trying to find ways around having their operations delayed for any reason.”</p>
<p>“The problem is this stuff is so normalized,” he added. “There should be more attention paid to these train-and-equip authorities, whether it&#8217;s special forces or DOD regular, because it&#8217;s really kind of a PR-friendly way to sell endless war.”</p></div></div><div class="InlineDonationPromo-container" id="third-party--article-bottom" data-reactid="293"><div class="InlineDonationPromo" data-reactid="294"><div class="InlineDonationPromo-inner" data-reactid="295"><div class="InlineDonationPromo-body" data-reactid="296"><span class="InlineDonationPromo-intro-text" data-reactid="297">Wait! Before you go</span><span class="InlineDonationPromo-text" data-reactid="298"> on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn’t done it?

Consider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren’t on the beat?

The kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable. The Intercept is an independent nonprofit news outlet. We don’t have ads, so we depend on our members — 35,000 and counting — to help us hold the powerful to account. Joining is simple and doesn’t need to cost a lot: You can become a sustaining member for as little as $3 or $5 a month. That’s all it takes to support the journalism you rely on.</span><a class="InlineDonationPromo-link InlineDonationPromo-link--en" rel="noopener" target="_blank"

Because most members of Congress — including those directly responsible for overseeing foreign affairs — have no input and little visibility into where and how the programs are run, 127e-related hostilities can lack the congressional authorization required by the U.S. Constitution, argued Katherine Ebright, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“There’s reason to suspect the Department of Defense has used 127e partners to engage in combat beyond the scope of any authorization for use of military force or permissible self-defense,” Ebright told The Intercept, noting substantial confusion at the Pentagon and in Congress over a stipulation that 127e programs support only authorized ongoing military operations. “That kind of unauthorized use of force, even through partners rather than U.S. soldiers themselves, would contravene constitutional principles.”\u003c/p>\n\u003c!-- BLOCK(photo)[5](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PHOTO%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22RESOURCE%22%7D)(%7B%22scroll%22%3Afalse%2C%22align%22%3A%22center%22%2C%22width%22%3A%221024px%22%7D) --\>\u003cdiv class=\"img-wrap align-center  width-fixed\" style=\"width: 1024px;\">\u003c!-- CONTENT(photo)[5] --\>\n\u003cimg class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-401127\" src=\"https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/wp-uploads/sites/1/2022/06/22096119_1262111187226771_298605369197715840_o-2-1024x652.jpg\" alt=\"22096119_1262111187226771_298605369197715840_o-2\" />\n\u003cp class=\"caption\">A U.S. Army Special Forces Operational Detachment Alpha team soldier, likely on a 127e mission, according to journalist Wes Morgan, is seen along with Nigerien counterparts at a Nigerien Army range on Sept. 11, 2017.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp class=\"caption source\">\nPhoto: Richard Bumgardner, SOCFWD-NWA Public Affairs\u003c/p>\u003c!-- END-CONTENT(photo)[5] --\>\u003c/div>\u003c!-- END-BLOCK(photo)[5] --\>\n\u003ch2>Global Proxy War\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>The origins of the 127e program can be traced back to the earliest days of the U.S. war in Afghanistan, as commandos and CIA personnel sought to support the Afghan Northern Alliance in its fight against the Taliban.
