<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>Welcome to BlackHost, a small website focused on technology and security, offering open source programs and free anonymous services available also on the dark side of the web.</p>
<div class="divider"></div>
<h3>News</h3>
<p>Sunday 12th December 2021 - Security Hardening<span class="right">#109</span></p><p>BlackHost has now enforced encryption on all traffic towards its services: plaintext connections will either be redirected to a secure channel or dropped.<br />
Specifically this applies for the web interfaces and the mail server.<br />
The mailserver security has also been hardened, implementing DNSSEC, DANE TLSA and dropping connections using weak protocols.</p><div class="divider"></div><p>Friday 14th May 2021 - SPAM Abuse<span class="right">#108</span></p><p>Due the repetitive service abuse, BlackHost has put some restrictions on the number of outgoing emails per user.<br />
Hopefully this small change will pass unnoticed by polite users.</p><div class="divider"></div><p>Tuesday 11th May 2021 - Onion Email SSL<span class="right">#107</span></p><p>The email service facing the TOR network with the v3 address can be now accessed using SMTPS, POP3S and IMAPS.
</p><div class="divider"></div><p>Monday 10th May 2021 - Onion v3 SSL Certificate<span class="right">#106</span></p><p>BlackHost has now implemented a verified SSL certificate for its onion v3 address, which is now the set as the default Onion-Location.<br />
Since HTTPS traffic hasn't been enforced yet, you can either try the new certificate manually or you can try it by clicking <a href="https://blackhost7pws76u6vohksdahnm6adf7riukgcmahrwt43wv2drvyxid.onion">here</a>.<br />
Furthermore, as the deprecation of the old onion addresses approaches, soon all traffic will be gradually redirected to the new address.<br />
And soon all traffic will enforce encryption.</p><div class="divider"></div><p>Tuesday 4th May 2021 - Mailboxes Quota Support<span class="right">#105</span></p><p>The mailboxes now come with a storage quota, visible also in the webmail.</p><div class="divider"></div><p>Monday 26th April 2021 - v3 Email Addresses<span class="right">#104</span></p><p>BlackHost has now extended its email support to its TOR v3 Address.<br />
Every mailbox now comes with three associated emails (all synchronized on the server, and so almost interchangeable):
<ul><li>@blackhost.xyz;</li><li>@blackhost5xlrhev.onion;</li><li>@blackhost7pws76u6vohksdahnm6adf7riukgcmahrwt43wv2drvyxid.onion.</li></ul></p><div class="divider"></div><p>Thursday 11th February 2021 - New TOR v3 address<span class="right">#103</span></p><p>Soon onion v2 addresses will be no longer supported, precisely, in October 2021, that’s why BlackHost has put its efforts in order to generate a new v3 address: <a href="http://blackhost7pws76u6vohksdahnm6adf7riukgcmahrwt43wv2drvyxid.onion/">blackhost7pws76u6vohksdahnm6adf7riukgcmahrwt43wv2drvyxid.onion</a>.<br >With that, the hidden service migration has officially started and soon the v3 address support will be extended to all of BlackHost services.</p><div class="divider"></div><p>Friday 22nd January 2021 - Bat to Exe Source and Files Upload<span class="right">#102</span></p><p>Fortunately enough the source code of a beta version of the <a href="/?id=bte">Bat to Exe</a> has been found and, after having been partially rewritten, it is now complete and you can now download it.<br />
Also, due the repetitive abuse of the <a href="/?id=fup">Files Upload service</a> BlackHost is no longer allowing uploads form the TOR network. Sorry for the inconvenience.</p><div class="divider"></div><p>Friday 4th December 2020 - IPv6 Reconfiguration<span class="right">#101</span></p><p>BlackHost has restored its IPv6 support!</p><div class="divider"></div><p>Tuesday 24th November 2020 - Bug Fix in the Email System<span class="right">#100</span></p><p>Some bugs concerning the new email addresses registration have been fixed.</br>
<b>Important</b> some mailboxes may be reassigned in the next few days because, due small misconfiguration error, they were assigned a wrong user-defined address. BlackHost apologizes for the inconvenience.</p><div class="divider"></div><p>Wednesday 28th October 2020 - Port Scanner Source Code<span class="right">#99</span></p><p>The source code of the <a href="/?id=ps">Port Scanner</a> has been released, check it out!</p><div class="divider"></div><p>Thursday 15th October 2020 - Published Source Codes<span class="right">#98</span></p><p>As you may have noticed, the source codes of the <a href="/?id=vm">Virus Maker</a>, the <a href="/?id=eb">Email Bomber</a> and the <a href="/?id=stg">Steganographer</a> are available for download.<br />
Also the Steganographer has been updated to support encryption (AES).</p><div class="divider"></div><p>Saturday 3rd October 2020 - Programs are Back<span class="right">#97</span></p><p>The programs section has been restored, you can now download all of the programs that used to be here!<br />
The source code of the programs will be released soon, and it will be announced in the main page.<br />
Sadly some source codes have been lost, so there will be available only the binaries until their code will be rewritten, these unfortunate programs are the Autoclicker, the Bat to Exe converter and the Flooder.<br /><br />
As now, the Files Upload section hasn't implemented any encryption method, and since BlackHost may be considered responsible for the content on his server, despite declines any responsibility for any content uploaded by others, this is a remainder that it's strictly forbidden to upload content that is considered illegal under the italian jurisdiction. All illegal content will be removed, sorry.<br />Back in 2019 the website was already taken down for it's programs and this hopefully won't happen again.</p><div class="divider"></div><p>Wednesday 30th September 2020 - Comments Restored and Other Minor Fixes<span class="right">#96</span></p><p>The comments functionality has been restored on the website, also after a delicate work BlackHost managed to recover almost all of the comments that were lost after the old server migration occured on the 29th March 2019. Sadly, these recovered comments date could be altered by some days.<br />Other minor bug fixes, such as correcting the display of the user list and fixing the user registration form, have been applied.</p><div class="divider"></div><p>Tuesday 15th September 2020 - Email Server on the TOR Network<span class="right">#95</span></p><p>The email server is online again.<br />
It was entirely moved on the TOR network: your primary email address would be @blackhost5xlrhev.onion.<br />
But, as before, it will still be accessible from the clearnet domains mail.blackhost.xyz and blackhost.xyz (as well as blackhost5xlrhev.onion).<br />
This new configuration allows the server to send emails to both the onion network and the clearnet, in addition to ensuring more security.<br /><br />
BlackHost apologises again for the inconveniences that led to a long period of downtime the email service and sincerely hopes to be found by all the old users.<br />
It wasn't yet the end of the journey, it was just a new beginning!</p><div class="divider"></div><p>Thursday 10th September 2020 - Online Again!<span class="right">#94</span></p><p>After having been offline for a while, BlackHost is finally online again!</p><div class="divider"></div><p>Friday 29th March 2019 - New Libre Server<span class="right">#93</span></p><p>BlackHost has been down due server updates, but now it runs only free software!<br />
The mail system is under maintenance, it will be moved entirely on the TOR network.</p><div class="divider"></div><p>Thursday 31st January 2019 - Website Blocked<span class="right">#92</span></p><p>The clearnet website 'blackhost.xyz' has been taken down by the .XYZ registry.
</p><div class="divider"></div><p>Friday 29th September 2017 - New server!<span class="right">#91</span></p><p>BlackHost has now a new self-hosted dedicated server!<br />The security of the server and it's services were heavily improved: now all the website content is on a full encrypted disk.<br />The mailserver was successfully set up and the <a href="http://blackhost5xlrhev.onion">onion domain</a> has no longer network problems.<br>There is also something new... an IRC Server! Accessible from irc.blackhost.xyz on ports <a href="irc://irc.blackhost.xyz:6667/main">6667</a> and <a href="ircs://irc.blackhost.xyz:6697/main">6697</a> (SSL)</p><div class="divider"></div><p>Tuesday 10th January 2017 - Happy New Year 2017<span class="right">#90</span></p><p>Happy new year to all!<br />
Sorry for didn't have sent any newsletter, but there aren't so many things to say and also times are getting hard and free time for developing this website is decresing :(.<br />
Unfortunately the website is still under revision and the work is progressing slowly.<br />
CMS progress:
<ol>
<li>Custom settings</li>
<li>Main page</li>
<li>Page handling structure</li>
<li>Url rewrite-friendly structure</li>
<li>User page & class</li>
</ol>
There's left only to do the Administration Area, maybe a newsletter page and the setup file!<br />
Bad news for the programs, many of them (or maybe all) will be removed due some bugs (error exception are not handled properly), and also because they are out-of-date and with the evolution of the Windows OS, they might not work properly.<br />

So the website in the next weeks / months may be unavailable, sorry for the inconvenience.</p><div class="divider"></div><p>Monday 12th September 2016 - Chatroom<span class="right">#88</span></p><p>The <a href="/?id=chat">Chat</a> script was updated: on an user' suggestion was implemented the possibility to create and change rooms and an anti-flood feature!</p><div class="divider"></div><p>Thursday 8th September 2016 - Games Section<span class="right">#87</span></p><p>The Games Section was removed and replaced by the <a href="/?id=hgm">Hacker Game</a>.</p><div class="divider"></div><p>Wednesday 7th September 2016 - User System<span class="right">#86</span></p><p>The ID system of the <a href="/?id=user">User Page</a> were redesigned, for a better performance and usability.<br />
