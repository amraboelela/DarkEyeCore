                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Men who were</u> traveling with Carmelo Cruz Marcos, a 32-year-old Mexican migrant who was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent in southern Arizona earlier this year, told investigators that the agent and his colleagues appeared to tamper with evidence and concoct a cover story following the fatal incident.</p>
<p>After months of silence in the case, the Cochise County Attorney’s Office announced on Monday that it had insufficient evidence to bring charges against the Border Patrol agent, Kendrek Bybee Staheli, for the February shooting and that the agent’s actions appeared justified under Arizona self-defense laws. Late Wednesday night, the Cochise County Sheriff’s Department, the lead local agency that investigated the case, released a 28-page file that formed the basis for the prosecutor’s decision.</p>
<p>In an interview with authorities, Staheli described fearing for his life during his encounter with Cruz, claiming that Cruz picked up a rock as he attempted to take him into custody, causing the Border Patrol agent to open fire. Staheli’s partner, who did not witness the fatal encounter, said Staheli was distraught after killing Cruz and asked to be held.</p>
<p>Migrants who Cruz was traveling with, later interviewed by county officials, provided a more chilling version of events, with one claiming that the agents appeared to move Cruz’s body after he was killed and that Staheli’s partner told him things would be fine so long as Staheli said he was scared and that Cruz threatened him with a rock.</p>
<p>The case has sparked outrage in Mexico, with Cruz’s family alleging that the father of three was “assassinated” by U.S. border agents. In an interview last month, an attorney for the family confirmed that they intended to file a lawsuit in response to the killing.</p>

<p>“We totally condemn the use of violence,” Ricardo Peña, head of the Mexican consulate in Douglas, Arizona, where Staheli and his partner are based, told The Intercept in an interview prior to the announcement that charges would not be filed in the case.</p>
<p>The sheriff’s department investigation also confirmed the role of a controversial Border Patrol crime scene response unit, known as a Critical Incident Teams, in the case. Last week, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2022-May/critical-incident-response-memo-0522.pdf">announced</a> that the teams, which operate borderwide, were being disbanded after years of allegations of tampering with investigations and evidence in cases involving the deaths of migrants.</p>
<p>In a press release last month, demanding an independent investigation, Karns and Karns, a Los Angeles-based law firm representing the Cruz family, said the use of the units reflects a “glaring conflict of interest.”</p>
<p>“My husband was a gentle and peaceful man trying to provide for his family,&#8221; Cruz’s wife, Yazmin Nape Quintero, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/demand-for-independent-investigation-of-shooting-death-by-us-border-patrol-of-unarmed-migrant-carmelo-cruz-marcos-301517866.html">said</a> at the time. “He would never threaten the Border Patrol, and it is despicable for the Border Patrol to claim that he did. We seek to clear his name, and we seek justice so other families won&#8217;t suffer like we are suffering.”</p>

<p><u>The shooting occurred</u> in a rugged corridor of the Peloncillo Mountains known as Skeleton Canyon on the night of February 19. Cruz was traveling with a group of at least nine other migrants. They wore the camouflage and carpet booties common among migrants traversing the region.</p>
<p>Staheli, who joined the Border Patrol in 2019 following a 10-month stint as a police officer in Utah, was assigned to the agency’s mounted unit, known as the horse patrol. Staheli’s partner, Tristan Tang, is a seven-year veteran of the agency.</p>
<p>Four days after the killing — Border Patrol agents, according to the sheriff&#8217;s report, are not allowed to speak with local authorities within 72 hours of a killing — Staheli, with his lawyers present, gave an interview to county investigators. Staheli told them he and Tang were looking for signs of unauthorized border crossers along Geronimo Trail Road when they received a radio call alerting them that a sensor had picked up migrants in the area.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[2](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[2] -->
<p>The agents headed in the direction of the sensor. The terrain became rough, so they dismounted and continued on foot. Eventually, they came across the migrants, who fled.</p>
<p>The two agents had apprehended three of the migrants when Tang, with night vision goggles, spotted a fourth in Staheli’s area. According to Staheli’s account, he was between 70 to 80 yards from his partner when he closed in on the migrant. When Staheli reached the fleeing migrant, the report said, the man “turned around and through [sic] a punch at him with a closed fist.”</p>
<p>Staheli told investigators that the man in front of him was shorter than he was but appeared to outweigh him and that he was wearing an “older army style camo” that, in his mind, indicated that he was working for a Mexican drug cartel and thus likely to put up a fight. According to his autopsy, the man in question, Cruz Marcos, was 5 feet, 4 inches tall and weighed 159 pounds.</p>
<p>Staheli claimed that Cruz’s blow glanced off his shoulder and struck him in the jaw. He tackled Cruz to the ground and “told the subject to place his hands behind his back but he failed to comply.” Efforts to pry Cruz’s arms out from under him were failing, Staheli said. As the two grappled, Staheli said he grew worried that Cruz could have a weapon or that his companions might attempt to rescue him, so he began punching him in the face repeatedly. The continuous blows caused Cruz to become “very upset,” the report said, and he managed to buck Staheli off his back.</p>
<p>According to Staheli, Cruz then picked up a rock “seven to ten inches long, oval shaped and bigger than a soft ball,” and cocked his arm back like he was preparing to throw. Staheli told investigators that he thought he was going to die. “He said he then drew his service pistol, pointed it at the subject and fired,” the report said. “He said he fired more than once. He said he fired many rounds but could not recall how many.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[3] -->
<p>An autopsy confirmed that Cruz was shot four times, twice in the face and twice in the chest. He also had bruising on his right cheek and neck and a cut on his scalp.</p>
<p>After the shots were fired, Tang called out to see if his partner was OK. Staheli yelled back that he was fine. Tang rushed to the scene and told his partner to stand back while he attempted to provide medical care to the man on the ground.</p>
<p>“Agent Tang saw lots of blood,” the report said. The man was lying on his back with “multiple holes” in his body and clearly dead. “Agent Tang then focused back to Agent Staheli to ensure he was still okay,” the report said. “He asked Agent Tang to hold onto him, so he hugged him.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Agent Tang said they waited approximately 2 hours for other agents to arrive at their location,&#8221; the report said. &#8220;He did not talk anymore about the incident with Agent Staheli.”</p>
<p>In Staheli’s account, one of the migrants in custody asked him if he had just killed a man. Staheli confirmed that he had and when the migrant asked why, he said, “Because he tried to kill me.” The migrant warned the agent that he would not sleep well that night, “that he was nervous and shaking and that his spirit was going to follow him, that he would haunt you for the rest of your life, you better watch your back.”</p>
<p>Cruz’s body was removed from the scene the following day. “Although the exact rock which Agt. Staheli described as being used by Carmelo was not recovered many rocks were noted in the area and photographs of the scene were taken which clearly show the rocks,” county investigators noted. “Based off of evidence at the scene, trajectory and angle of shots fired into Carmelo&#8217;s body, and statements taken from the agents and witnesses it appears Carmelo was the aggressor in this incident.”</p>
<p><u>Cochise County detectives</u> interviewed some of the men who were with Cruz the night that he died. Filomeno Ruiz-Martinez recalled little beyond the flash of lights and the English-speaking agent who told him to raise his hands. His companion, Irving Torres Peralta, had more to say.</p>
<p>“He said he observed four lights, he said he remembered three of the people he had crossed with had been apprehended, he said one of those subjects was his brother,” the report said. “He said when they were apprehended he could hear a male subject say in the English language, ‘This is America motherfucker.’”</p>
<p>Torres told investigators that he understood English and that he heard the words while he was hiding with Ruiz-Martinez.</p>
<p>The report noted that Torres attributed the words to Staheli but cast doubt on the veracity of the claim because Ruiz-Martinez did not mention hearing the same thing. Ruiz-Martinez, however, also told investigators that he does not understand English.</p>
<p>Investigators asked Staheli if recalled saying “You are in America motherfucker” before killing Cruz. The agent said he did not.</p>
<p>Carlos Juan Torres-Peralta, brother of Irving Torres-Peralta, was also questioned. Before his interview began, he asked the investigators in Spanish, “Are you going to kill me too?”</p>
<p>Torres-Peralta described being set upon by agents on horseback. One of the agents dismounted, he said, and yelled, “This is America.” That agent also said to his companion, “Stop or I’m going to shoot you.” Torres-Peralta said his companion tried to run away but tripped on a rock. When the agent caught up with the man, he said, “This is America motherfucker.” According to the report, Torres-Peralta was referring to Staheli.</p>

<p>“He said then he heard Agent [Staheli] say, ‘You’re in America motherfucker’ and he heard shots fired,” the report said. Torres-Peralta said he saw the flash from Staheli’s service weapon.</p>
<p>“He said he didn’t see anything but believed both agents went to look at his companion and they moved his companion’s body,” the report added. The investigators noted that Torres-Peralta “did not describe what happened prior to what he believes were the agents moving the body.”</p>
<p>Investigators were confused by Torres-Peralta’s claims: “If he had not seen them how could he have made the determination they were moving his companion&#8217;s body.” Torres-Peralta went on to say that he heard Staheli’s partner tell him not to talk to anyone. “He said he heard the other agent tell Agent [Staheli] again, don’t worry man, don’t talk with no one and it will be fine,” the report recounted</p>
<p>Horaldo Jimenez-Cruz, who was also interviewed, said he was already in custody when Staheli opened fire and saw nothing of the incident. Ricardo Huerta-Nepomuceno said the same.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(promote-promo)[5](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_PROMO%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22align%22%3Anull%2C%22crop%22%3A%22promo%22%2C%22promo%22%3A%22immigrants%22%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-promo="immigrants" data-crop="promo" data-align=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-promo)[5] -->
<p>Investigators conducted follow up interviews with the Torres-Peralta brothers and the other men, noting that “for the most part that four of the subjects statements were some what consistent with regards to the information they initially provided.” Carlos Torres-Peralta, however, added additional information, telling investigators that after Staheli took him into custody, he told him, “Shut up or I will shoot you.”</p>
<p>The investigators observed that Torres-Peralta was far more fluent in the English language than he initially appeared. He again said that he believed the Border Patrol agents moved Cruz’s body and that he “heard them discussing how they should follow up with statements and not say anything to anyone, and that Agent Tang had told Agent Staheli ‘it would all be ok and that he had his back.’”</p>
<p>“Carlos further said he heard Agent Tang tell Agent Staheli that he should say he was attacked with a rock,” the report said. “Carlos statements would suggest the agents had covered up evidence and would not be truthful with any after action interviews they would have.”</p>
<p><u>In a letter</u> to the sheriff’s department on Monday, county attorney Brian McIntyre said Staheli’s actions in the Cruz case “<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22009015-staheli-decline">appear to be justified under Arizona law</a>,” noting that law enforcement officials can only use lethal force in those instances in which they feel that they — or another person — are facing a deadly threat.</p>
<p>McIntyre added that in Arizona, those officials are afforded the same self-defense protections as anyone else in the state. In Cruz’s case, McIntyre said, there was not only “insufficient evidence” to contradict Staheli’s claims, “Indeed, the evidence appears to support the Agent’s version of events.”</p>
<p>Last month, Dan Karns, lawyer for the Cruz family, flew to Mexico to meet with Cruz’s family and surviving children. In Cruz’s home state of Puebla, Karns found growing outrage over the case, which for many has come to symbolize the systematically brutal treatment of migrants on the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>“They’re pissed,” Karns told The Intercept. “Just the undignified behavior of Border Patrol, consistently, over and over and over again, people are getting really upset in Mexico and who can blame them?”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>After decades of</u> disappearances, thousands of lives lost, and a new law requiring greater accountability, the U.S. Border Patrol continues to fail at counting migrant deaths along the southern border, a recent report to Congress found.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[0] -->
<p>The Government Accountability Office, in a little-noticed <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-105053">report</a> released late last month, informed lawmakers that the Border Patrol “has not collected and recorded, or reported to Congress, complete data on migrant deaths.” The omission included data the Border Patrol was required to track and turn over under legislation passed last year. The law specifically obligates the agency to include data collected by entities other than the Border Patrol itself in its reports on migrant deaths. The failings mark the first public government assessment of the agency’s response to the new legal requirements.</p>
<p>“It confirms something that we suspected for a long time,” Daniel Martínez, an associate professor at the University of Arizona and one of the world’s leading experts on migrant deaths in the Sonoran Desert, told The Intercept. “We’ve known this for a while — that the Border Patrol is not doing an effective job of counting the dead.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->
<p>The report to Congress focused heavily on the Border Patrol’s Tucson Sector; in recent years, major discrepancies have emerged between the agency’s data and that of the local medical examiner’s office.</p>
<p>Martínez and his colleagues at the University of Arizona’s Binational Migration Institute highlighted those discrepancies in an extensive report published last spring. The <a href="https://bmi.arizona.edu/sites/bmi.arizona.edu/files/BMI-Migrant-Deaths-in-Southern-Arizona-2021-English.pdf">academics’ report</a> looked at three decades of migrant death data collected by the Tucson-based Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner — which has jurisdiction in five southern counties — and compared it against similar data collected by the local Border Patrol sector.</p>
<p>The researchers found that throughout the early to mid-2000s the two datasets closely mirrored one another. The Border Patrol’s numbers even frequently exceeded those of the medical examiner’s office — not a surprise, since the Tucson Sector covers nearly all of Arizona. Then in 2014, the tallies began sharply diverging, with the Border Patrol reporting far fewer migrant deaths. In the 2020 fiscal year, for example, the medical examiner documented the recovery of 206 sets of migrant remains across the scorching Sonoran Desert, the highest total in a decade. The Tucson Sector of the Border Patrol, which covers the same stretch of the border as the medical examiner, recorded just 42.</p>
<p>Overall, from fiscal years 2014 through 2020, the medical examiner’s office counted 855 suspected migrant remains recovered. The Border Patrol’s Tucson Sector counted 488. It was an indication that the Border Patrol had shifted to only tracking cases in which its own agents discovered migrant remains, while the medical examiner’s office counted Border Patrol recoveries in addition to those made by a wider group of actors in the Sonoran Desert, including local law enforcement agencies, humanitarian groups, and private citizens.</p>

<p>The GAO found the medical examiner’s data “sufficiently reliable for reporting the number of migrant deaths in the Tucson sector” and interviewed local Border Patrol officials about the years of discrepancies. The officials blamed “confusion as to the definitions of deaths and rescues” and “supervisor turnover” for its gaps in record-keeping. Agents consult the medical examiner’s data for “overall situational awareness,” officials told the GAO, but they do not update their agency’s internal system for tracking migrant deaths when they are reported by the medical examiner’s office, as required by law. (Customs and Border Protection, the parent agency of the Border Patrol, did not respond to a detailed request for comment.)</p>
<p>The GAO’s report comes as spring is turning to summer, historically the most lethal months for migrants crossing the border — last year was Arizona’s deadliest on record.</p>
<p>“As far as I’m concerned, Border Patrol data are not reliable,” Martínez said. “And that’s a huge problem, especially if policymakers are relying on their data to make decisions.”</p>

<p><u>Over the past</u> two decades, an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 people have lost their lives crossing the southern border, though the true number is impossible to know due years of spotty record-keeping on the part of the nation’s premiere border enforcement agency and its local law enforcement partners. The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/2174/text">Missing Persons and Unidentified Remains Act</a>, a rare piece of bipartisan border legislation signed into law in the final days of the Trump administration, was supposed to change that.</p>
<p>Under the law, the Border Patrol’s legal obligations are clear: When a migrant’s body is found on the U.S.-Mexico divide, the agency is required to document the discovery, no matter who made the initial encounter. According to the GAO, that has not happened.</p>
<p>“Specifically, Border Patrol’s fiscal year 2020 report to Congress did not contain complete data because the agency did not record all available information on migrant deaths from external entities in its system of record, or describe these data limitations in the report,” the GAO report said. “In particular, Border Patrol is not recording all migrant deaths in instances where an external entity first discovers the remains.”</p>

<p>Funneling migrants into “hostile terrain” is the core feature of a Border Patrol enforcement <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5987025-Border-Patrol-Strategic-Plan-1994-and-Beyond.html">strategy</a> known as “<a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/05/04/no-more-deaths-scott-warren-migrants-border-arizona/">prevention through deterrence</a>.” Implemented in 1994 under the Clinton administration, the original idea was to push people into areas so rugged and deadly — while at the same time bolstering surveillance and interdiction infrastructure around major border cities — that they would not cross the border without authorization under fear of death.</p>
<p>Two and a half decades later, the strategy has fostered a flourishing human smuggling economy and transformed the U.S.-Mexico divide into the deadliest border in the Western Hemisphere. According to the GAO, “Border Patrol agents along the southwest border report that 9-1-1 calls from lost individuals have become a daily occurrence.”</p>
<p>The GAO had good reason to examine the Border Patrol’s Tucson Sector, Martínez explained, not because the area is uniquely better or worse than its counterparts, but because the medical examiner’s office in Tucson represents the “gold standard when it comes to investigating border-crosser deaths.”</p>
<p>Nearly all of Southern Arizona’s border runs through public lands, unlike South Texas, where the divide often cuts through vast private ranches. Additionally, Tucson is a large city, whereas the counties of South Texas include some of the most impoverished districts in the country. Borderwide, these local differences in access and resources directly inform how migrant bodies are found and accounted for. When it comes to tallying the dead, the GAO found, inconsistency reigns.</p>
<p>“Border Patrol sector officials from the four sectors we contacted told us that they coordinate with external entities — such as medical examiners— when remains are discovered,” the report said. “However, Border Patrol sectors we contacted are not consistently recording the data as required.”</p>

<p><u>What Martínez found</u> most perplexing was why the Border Patrol’s Tucson Sector suddenly began undercounting migrant deaths in 2014. Bureaucratic breakdowns and confusion over the definition of migrant deaths fail to fully explain the shift, he argued, and they certainly do not excuse failure to meet legal obligations and provide reliable migrant death data to Congress.</p>
<p>“These data are clearly here. If Border Patrol of the Tucson Sector or the Border Patrol want the data, they can go into Pima County Office of Medical Examiner and get those data,” Martínez said. “I know that Pima County Office of Medical Examiner routinely provides the Tucson Sector with these data.”</p>
<p>The deadliest year that the medical examiner in Tucson ever recorded was in 2021, with 226 sets of human remains recovered. Border Patrol officials and news reports attributed the deaths to the state’s soaring temperatures and in some cases to the climate crisis.</p>

<p>The reasoning is understandable, Martínez said, but it obscures important truths about how and why migrants are dying in the desert.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.academia.edu/75461513/Climate_impact_or_policy_choice_The_spatiotemporality_of_thermoregulation_and_border_crosser_mortality_in_Southern_Arizona">a paper</a> published in the Geographical Journal in March, Martínez and his University of Arizona colleague Samuel Chambers showed how migrants are increasingly dying of exhaustion upon making it to “locations that are better suited to core temperature regulation, and therefore toward survival.”</p>
<p>High temperatures and the climate crisis, they argued, thus serve as a “moral alibi” for prevention through deterrence doing what it has always done. What’s really killing people in the desert, Martínez said, is an intentionally lethal policy colliding with an ongoing absence of political will and imagination to try something different.</p>
<p>“There are other alternatives besides just increased border enforcement, increased border militarization. There are solutions to undocumented immigration,” he said. “But I think the political will is not there in Washington, D.C. Immigration just becomes this political football that gets punted back and forth between the Democrats and Republicans every time you have a change in administration.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>President Joe Biden’s</u> immigration policies on the U.S.-Mexico border have fueled the prolonged detention of tens of thousands of asylum-seekers in the past year, according to a new report by a human rights group. Nearly all the immigrants apprehended by authorities during the period were taken into custody in a region where asylum access has been largely shuttered since March 2020 and where anyone who asks for asylum outside a port of entry — a right enshrined under domestic and international law — is considered a threat until proved otherwise.</p>
<p>Drawing from nearly 300 individual accounts, the <a href="https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/resource/i-m-prisoner-here-biden-administration-policies-lock-asylum-seekers">66-page report</a>, published Thursday by Human Rights First, describes activists, dissidents, student organizers, and others fleeing persecution in dozens of countries, only to languish for months in U.S. detention centers.</p>
<p>The report documents dehumanizing conditions within those centers; heightened levels of racist and abusive treatment of Black and LGTBQ+ asylum-seekers; children held in adult facilities; massive legal and economic challenges for those in custody; and the ongoing separation of families across the U.S-Mexico divide.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[0] -->“Detention is dehumanizing, dangerous, and cruel. It fuels family separation and re-traumatizes people.&#8221;<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[0] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[0] -->
<p>“Detention is dehumanizing, dangerous, and cruel,” Rebecca Gendelman, an associate attorney for refugee protection at Human Rights First and lead author of the report, told The Intercept. “It cuts off access to legal representation and information, preventing asylum-seekers from fairly representing their claims for protection. It inflicts physical and psychological harm. It fuels family separation and re-traumatizes people — including those who were detained, tortured, beaten, and threatened by the governments of the countries they fled — and it coerces people into giving up on their claims.”</p>
<p>The report comes just a month before the Biden administration is expected to lift Title 42. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rule issued by the Trump administration in March 2020 — over the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cdc-officials-objected-to-order-turning-away-migrants-at-border-11601733601">objections of career public health professionals</a> at the agency — Title 42 has been used to summarily expel or rebuff most migrants, including asylum-seekers, at and between official ports of entry. With the lifting of the order, advocates and law enforcement officials anticipate a significant increase in individuals attempting to cross the border and apprehensions to rise as a result.</p>

<p>Human Rights First’s report raises concerns that the Biden administration’s current enforcement priorities could mean that more asylum-seekers find themselves in U.S. detention centers in the months ahead.</p>
<p>“As the Biden administration ends the illegal Title 42 policy and restores compliance with refugee law, it should not jail asylum-seekers who it processes into the United States — it should welcome them with dignity,” Gendelman said. “The government should partner with NGOs to put in place a humanitarian reception system for asylum-seekers coming to the border.”</p>

<p><u>The report scrutinizes</u> the enforcement priorities that Biden first implemented as interim measures a month after taking office. In September, the priorities were made official in <a href="https://www.ice.gov/doclib/news/guidelines-civilimmigrationlaw.pdf">a memo</a> that the head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued directing personnel to “use our discretion and focus our enforcement resources in a more targeted way.”</p>

<p>Biden had vowed to break with his predecessor on immigration matters, <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/2020-10-23/biden-hits-trump-on-migrant-family-separation-asylum-policies-while-trump-touts-border-record">pointing</a> to former President Donald Trump’s separation of families on the border as a “criminal” act that “violates every notion of who we are as a nation.” His shift in priorities did mark a change — Trump made nearly every undocumented immigrant in the country an equal priority for deportation — but it also contained an important caveat for the border itself: Any “noncitizen who poses a threat to border security” was still considered “a priority for apprehension and removal.”</p>
<p>Under this framework, “a threat to border security” has meant anyone arrested attempting to enter the country illegally at a port of entry or anyone apprehended on U.S. soil without authorization to be in the country after November 1, 2020. Though “there could be mitigating or extenuating facts and circumstances” and officials are encouraged to “evaluate the totality of the facts and circumstances and exercise their judgment accordingly,” Biden’s priorities do not include blanket exceptions for any groups.</p>
<p>According to Human Rights First, U.S. immigration officials have used the priority placed on border security to justify detaining asylum-seekers as a matter of course. “In December 2021, an ICE officer confirmed to Human Rights First that ICE jails people who come to the border pursuant to the enforcement priorities guidance,” the report said, adding that the priorities have also been used to deny asylum-seekers release from detention.</p>

<p>Exact figures on how many asylum-seekers the Biden administration has jailed are difficult to ascertain, the report noted, because ICE has for several years failed to produce data in a timely or consistent manner, despite being required to do so by law. Customs and Border Protection runs its own detention centers near the border.</p>
<p>People apprehended by CBP are generally paroled, expelled, or transferred to ICE’s nationwide jail network for further adjudication of their immigration case. If they are seeking asylum, those individuals are entitled to what’s known as a “credible fear interview” to make an initial assessment of their case. Human Rights First arrived at its conclusion of “tens of thousands” of asylum-seekers detained under Biden, with most taken into custody on the border, by extrapolating from the available data related to those interviews.</p>
<p>“We know that over 66,000 asylum-seekers have been referred for credible fear interviews since February 2021,” Gendelman said. “Typically, the vast majority of credible fear interviews occur in detention, and we also know that the vast majority of people who have been booked into ICE custody under the Biden administration have been coming from CBP custody.”</p>
<p><u>On average,</u> the asylum-seekers Human Rights First spoke with experienced nearly four months of detention, though many were jailed for up to 10 months or more. They included “a Nicaraguan asylum seeker detained for three months and denied parole as a ‘border security’ enforcement priority; a Venezuelan asylum seeker living with HIV imprisoned for nearly five months; and an Angolan human rights defender detained for eight months even though his wife and children are living in the United States pursuing their asylum claims,” the report said.</p>
<p>Asylum-seekers jailed by the Biden administration have often remained in custody even after establishing a credible fear of persecution in their interviews with U.S. immigration officials, according to Human Rights First.</p>
<p>“While the total number of asylum seekers detained after receiving positive fear determinations has declined significantly in recent months, government data reveals that asylum seekers in ICE detention who established a fear of persecution have been jailed for an average of 10.75 months (326.8 days), as of late-March 2022,” the report said. “Erroneous negative determinations and months-long delays in conducting fear interviews have prolonged detention for many others.”</p>
<p>The report documented extensive financial hurdles for asylum-seekers in custody, with the average immigration bond in fiscal year 2021 set at nearly $10,000 and some set as high as $100,000. The report noted that the fact of being jailed, coupled with the lack of guaranteed access to a lawyer, greatly diminishes an asylum-seeker’s ability to meaningfully access the legal system to present their case.</p>

<p><u>Inside the detention</u> centers themselves, Human Rights First found “horrific abuse and mistreatment,” including “an asylum seeker thrown into solitary confinement, without clothing, after a suicide attempt, and denied access to a shower, toilet paper, and a toothbrush for 21 days; a Mexican transgender asylum seeker who was sexually assaulted after ICE jailed him in a unit that did not correspond to his gender identity and, for his own safety was forced to request to be held in near 24-hour lockdown in solitary confinement; and a Brazilian asylum seeker who was verbally abused by a therapist when he sought mental healthcare.”</p>

<p>According to the report, “Multiple minor children have been illegally held in adult detention facilities even though they presented documentation of their age.”</p>
<p>Asylum-seekers from Black-majority countries received particularly bad treatment, spending 27 percent more time in jail and facing harsher release requirements than other people held in detention. “In one instance, ICE officers explicitly stated that they had been instructed to release Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans to create additional detention bed space while ICE was simultaneously detaining large numbers of Haitian asylum seekers and migrants at the same facility,” the report said.</p>
<p>Human Rights First documented several individual cases of anti-Black abuse in immigration custody. According to the report, asylum-seekers had their braids or locks forcibly cut off by detention staff and racist comments were directed at Black asylum-seekers that included references to slavery and lynching.</p>
<p>In place of “border security threat” priorities for asylum-seekers, Human Rights First is pushing for “alternative to detention” programs that would link those individuals with legal counsel outside the jailhouse setting. Such programs have proved highly effective at ensuring that asylum-seekers attend their court hearings. A <a href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/measuring-absentia-removal-immigration-court">2021 study</a> by the American Immigration Council found that 96 percent of nondetained immigrants represented by a lawyer attended all of their hearings from 2008 to 2018. The “alternative to detention” programs are also vastly less expensive than the current model.</p>
<p>“Jailing asylum-seekers is not only cruel, but it’s also unnecessary and wasteful,” Gendelman said. “The Biden administration should instead use humane, proven, community-based case support to welcome asylum-seekers and allow them to pursue their cases while living in U.S. communities. It’s a cruel choice to detain them, and a costlier one as well.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>With a critical</u> contract deadline looming, a coalition of advocacy organizations is calling on the Biden administration to permanently end the federal government’s use of a Florida detention center with a long and troubled history of negligence, abuse, and violence as a holding pen for undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, nearly 20 legal and human rights organizations sent a petition featuring nearly 1,600 signatures to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas urging the Biden administration to abstain from renewing a contract for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s use of the Glades County Detention Center in Moore Haven, Florida. Citing scores of official complaints going back years, a <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a33042eb078691c386e7bce/t/625f2294fa0b2d06c52bc4ce/1650401940317/Letter+to+DHS_+Close+Glades+Petition.pdf">letter</a> sent with the petition describes “pervasive medical neglect, unlawful use of toxic chemicals, racialized violence, inhumane treatment, physical abuse, sexual misconduct, and attacks on individual’s dignity and safety that occur regularly” at the facility.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>The contract for Glades is up for renewal on April 30. The Biden administration <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article259766725.html">announced</a> that it was limiting ICE’s use of the county jail last month. Currently, there are no immigrant detainees locked up in the facility. The Shut Down Glades Coalition — the high-profile national organizations and local grassroots groups that sent Mayorkas the petition — said it should stay that way and is calling on the administration to officially terminate its relationship with the jail to ensure that it does.</p>
<p>“ICE often empties its detention centers in the face of public scrutiny only to quietly refill them months later under a veil of secrecy. We won’t let that happen here,” Sofia Casini, director of visitation advocacy strategies at Freedom for Immigrants, a nonprofit devoted to abolishing immigration detention and a member of the coalition, said in an email to The Intercept. “Years of failed, toothless investigations have further proven what we always knew to be true: Glades is beyond the reach of reform, and no amount of window dressing could change that reality.&#8221;</p>

<p>The coalition to close the Florida facility began coming together in late 2020 amid a terrifying wave of Covid-19 outbreaks that tore through ICE facilities. In the year and a half since, the groups have waged a steady campaign to close the detention center. Collaborating with individuals currently and formerly housed in the facility, waging hunger strikes and rallies, the efforts to close Glades started picking up momentum in recent months.</p>
<p>In March, Earthjustice, along with 13 other groups — many of them members of the Shut Down Glades Coalition — called on the Environmental Protection Agency to “<a href="https://earthjustice.org/sites/default/files/files/sign-on_letter_re._fifra_violations_at_glades_other_immigrant_detention_centers.pdf">immediately investigate</a>” Glades for the alleged misuse of hazardous disinfectants inside the facility’s poorly ventilated living and eating areas. (ICE declined to respond to a Scientific American investigation into the alleged practice, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/immigrants-in-u-s-detention-exposed-to-hazardous-disinfectants-every-day/">citing</a> “pending litigation on this subject.”)</p>

<p>In January, the American Civil Liberties Union and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington <a href="https://www.aclufl.org/en/request-prompt-remedial-action-regarding-ongoing-deletion-surveillance-video-ice-detention-facility">demanded</a> that ICE’s acting director, as well as the head archivist for the U.S. government, “promptly take action to address the ongoing deletion of surveillance video” by officials at Glades, including video that “may contain key evidence needed to vindicate the rights of immigrants detained at Glades.” (An ICE spokesperson <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article257692668.html">told</a> the Miami Herald that the agency was investigating the allegations in January.)</p>
<p>In November, the detention center was the site of a <a href="https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/glades-county-detention-center-carbon-monoxide-exposure-13425720">carbon monoxide leak</a> that led to the hospitalization of four people housed in the facility as well as a kitchen staffer. And in August, women held in the facility filed a complaint <a href="https://www.aclufl.org/en/request-prompt-remedial-action-regarding-ongoing-deletion-surveillance-video-ice-detention-facility">alleging</a> “being sprayed with a toxic chemical that poses a risk of infertility and exacerbates the spread of COVID” as well as “sexual voyeurism by male guards.”</p>
<p><u>Issues at the</u> facility have attracted attention from Congress. In July 2021, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida Democrat, wrote <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a33042eb078691c386e7bce/t/60f9b4f9ada0083784a9c028/1626977529997/Glades+County+Detention+Letter+Signed.pdf">her own letter</a> to Mayorkas, calling on the secretary to “move expeditiously to close” Glades.</p>
<p>Wasserman Schultz pointed to a complaint that members of the Shut Down Glades Coalition filed with the Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s Office of the Inspector General and Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties that included the testimonies of 25 individuals who described “patterns of medical abuse; lack of soap, hygiene products, sanitation, and PPE; continued transfers between facilities without quarantine; failures to follow court orders to release individuals from Glades; retaliation for peaceful protest, including a pattern of off-camera physical assault; use of toxic chemical spray in enclosed spaces; and hospitalizations and death.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A1%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="1"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[3] -->
<p>Wasserman Schultz sent Mayorkas <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/556459160/Letter-to-Secretary-Mayorkas-Feb-2022">a follow-up letter</a> reiterating her request in February. She is one of more than two dozen members of Congress who have called for Glades’s closure over the past two years.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ice-close-etowah-detention-center">press release</a> addressing the Biden administration’s to plan wind down its use of Glades, ICE acknowledged that it had “reduced its use of the Glades County Detention Center, in part due to persistent and ongoing concerns related to the provision of detainee medical care, and because the facility is of limited operational significance.”</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, ICE has continued to pay for a minimum number of beds, many of which the agency has not and likely will not utilize,” the statement added. “The agency will not extend the guaranteed minimum beds provision of the agreement. Any future use of the facility will be dependent on fully addressing any conditions that do not meet detention standards.”</p>
<p>Since 2017, nearly 80 complaints concerning conditions inside Glades have been filed with Homeland Security oversight offices. While those complaints “highlight the abuse suffered by roughly 140 individuals,” the Shut Down Glades Coalition noted, “the true extent of the harm is much broader as these complaints represent only the individuals who found the courage, resources, and allies to file the complaints.”</p>
<p>“So long as the Biden administration continues to prop up this abusive jail, it will continue to bear responsibility for the unconscionable human rights abuses committed against Black and brown immigrants held at Glades,” said Casini, of Freedom for Immigrants. &#8220;Glades is emblematic of the inherently abusive immigration detention system, and now is the moment to permanently shutter its doors and release all who were harmed there and secretly transferred to other detention centers.&#8221;</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Two miles north</u> of the line separating the U.S. and Mexico, where El Paso, Texas, meets Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, sits a modest one-story building that houses the Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center. The space is home to a staff of 19, including five lawyers and accredited legal advocates, who provide as much legal representation as they can to individuals fleeing the world’s most dangerous places. On average, they receive nearly 2,000 new calls for help a day.</p>
<p>Las Americas, like other nonprofit legal organizations along the border, is currently facing a critical moment. Over the past three years, the group has navigated a pair of policies enforced by Presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden that changed the shape of migration on the U.S.-Mexico border. The first, known as &#8220;Remain in Mexico&#8221; but officially called the Migrant Protection Protocols, forced asylum-seekers to wait out their cases in Mexico. The second, known as Title 42, enacted in March 2020 at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, authorized border officials to summarily expel asylum-seekers without even initiating a case.</p>
<p>Both programs fueled a massive rise in kidnappings and violence targeting asylum-seekers in northern Mexico. The Biden administration is expected to lift Title 42 next month, likely resulting in a significant rise in apprehensions along the border. &#8220;Remain in Mexico&#8221; is another matter.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>Though Biden ordered an end to the program upon taking office, a legal challenge filed by the state of Texas led to its reinstatement late last year. On April 26, the U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2022/01/remain-in-mexico-and-texas-anti-abortion-law/">will hear arguments</a> that could determine whether the program becomes a permanent fixture of the border. Should that happen, organizations like Las Americas, which has taken on 1,500 &#8220;Remain in Mexico&#8221;-related cases in the past three years, anticipate a difficult situation to go from bad to worse. The court’s historic arguments come at a time when, according to new polling, Democratic interest in immigration is at an all-time low and border aid groups that received millions of dollars in donations and public support under Trump are struggling to pay the bills.</p>
<p>“It’s really bad,” Linda Corchado, the interim executive director of Las Americas, told The Intercept. “And heartbreaking.”</p>

<p>Since Biden took office, Las Americas has been forced to lay off two full-time members of its team working on detention. For Corchado, the cuts couldn’t come at a worse time. The most dangerous feature of the Trump administration’s approach to the border has lived on under Biden — and could be largely made permanent by this month’s Supreme Court arguments — and the constituency that border advocates count on for support appears entirely checked out.</p>
<p>“It seems that many people believe the crisis is over, and it’s really not,” Corchado said. “It’s only gotten worse for us.”</p>

<p><u>Early on during</u> the Trump administration, when the U.S. government was forcibly separating asylum-seeking families by the thousands, the kind of work done by Las Americas drew international camera crews, congressional delegations, and, most importantly for a nonprofit like Las Americas, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/immigrant-rights-groups-find-trump-is-their-best-fundraiser/">donations</a>.</p>
<p>In 2019, the attention shifted away as the administration embarked on a new program of deterrence. &#8220;Remain in Mexico,&#8221; by design, forced asylum-seekers to wait out their cases in cities where migrant kidnapping and extortion is big business. The stories and made-for-TV images of profound human suffering were offloaded onto Mexican soil.</p>

<p>The shift had an out of sight, out of mind effect. By 2020, Las Americas’ <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/09/05/us-mexico-border-coronavirus/">beleaguered attorneys</a> were coping with a simultaneous drop-off in public interest and an unending stream of horror stories from their clients. The situation worsened when the pandemic struck and the Trump administration instituted Title 42. Between the two policies, the organization <a href="https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/resource/shameful-record-biden-administration-s-use-trump-policies-endangers-people-seeking-asylum">Human Rights First</a> has tallied more than 10,000 cases involving the assault, robbery, kidnapping, rape, or murder of individuals, including children, pushed back into Mexico.</p>
<p>The question of Americans’ concern about “illegal immigration” was the subject of <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/391820/four-americans-highly-concerned-illegal-immigration.aspx">a new Gallup survey</a> released Tuesday. The survey found 41 percent of Americans “worrying a great deal” about the issue and an additional 19 percent worrying “a fair amount.” On the flip side, 17 percent of Americans reported caring “only a little” and 23 percent reported caring “not at all,” a figure that has more than doubled since 2006.</p>

<p>While the level of concern is on “the high end” of readings taken over the past decade, the survey noted, “the modest shifts seen in Americans’ concern about illegal immigration over the years mask greater changes beneath the surface among partisans.”</p>
<p>Those changes may help explain the disinterest service providers like Corchado and her team at Las Americas are experiencing on the ground.</p>
<p>Republicans, according to Gallup, have grown increasingly concerned about immigration over the past two decades, from 21 percent reporting that they “worried a great deal” in 2001 to an all-time high of 76 percent in 2021. “More broadly,” the survey noted, “the overall percentage worried either a great deal or fair amount has expanded from just over half of Republicans in 2001 to nearly nine in 10 today.” The GOP’s rivals, meanwhile, have gone the opposite direction.</p>
<p>“Democrats have never worried less about illegal immigration,” Gallup found. From 2001 to 2014, the survey said, “the majority of Democrats were concerned a great deal or fair amount about illegal immigration, since then, the majority have been concerned only a little or not at all.” Gallup described the shift as “a wholesale change.”</p>

<p>In a call with reporters Friday highlighting the significance of the upcoming Supreme Court arguments, Margaret Cargioli, a directing attorney at the Los Angeles-based Immigrant Defenders Law Center, drew parallels between the family separation crisis that captured the nation’s attention in 2018 and the brutal exportation of border enforcement that continues with little public notice today.</p>
<p>Cargioli described her experience representing a family with two children who were enrolled in the &#8220;Remain in Mexico&#8221; program and kidnapped while riding a bus to the northern city of Nuevo Laredo. Once abducted, the children were forced to watch as one migrant was burned alive in a vat of acid and another had her tongue slit for disobeying her captors’ commands. “We represent individuals in the Migrant Protection Protocols today, and we continue to hear these stories,” Cargioli said. “That is the ugly truth of MPP.”</p>
<p>“If we cannot tolerate ‘zero tolerance’ and ripping children apart from their parents,” she added, “we cannot tolerate a policy that exposes asylum-seekers to harm in Mexico.”</p>

<p><u>Creating the most</u> expansive system for tracking, caging, and removing immigrants that the world has ever seen was a bipartisan undertaking. Over the two-decade period examined in Gallup’s polling, both Republicans and Democrats in Washington presided over the unprecedented expansion of a multibillion-dollar border interdiction, detention, and deportation apparatus.</p>
<p>Coupled with the tightening of asylum access in recent years, border militarization has made the act of seeking refuge on U.S. soil — a right enshrined under domestic and international law — vastly more dangerous, funneling families and individuals into remote areas of the desert and territories controlled by organized crime and abusive Mexican security forces. Programs like &#8220;Remain in Mexico&#8221; greatly exacerbate those dangers.</p>
<p>In early 2019, Corchado and her team represented a woman named Tania, a Black asylum-seeker from the Garifuna community of Honduras, who was pulled into the &#8220;Remain in Mexico&#8221; vortex just as the program was getting off the ground. Returned to Juárez, Tania’s skin color and tattered clothes made her a target for organized crime. Though she did as she was directed and returned to El Paso for her immigration hearing, Tania concluded that the process was a sham, just as many other asylum-seekers had. She and another woman decided that they would try their luck with a smuggler. Neither knew the man was in league with corrupt Mexican federal police.</p>
<p>The women were driven to various stash houses in Juárez. The night before they were told they would cross the border, they were taken to a home guarded by armed men in Mexican police uniforms. One of the uniformed men forced Tania to perform oral sex with a gun to her head. The following morning she and her traveling companion were taken to a new location where they were repeatedly raped. A week passed before the pair were found by local authorities and taken to a hospital.</p>
<p>Las Americas learned of Tania’s ordeal and quickly surmised that she had a compelling asylum case before ever being returned to Mexico. In a development that shocked Corchado and her colleagues, their office was contacted by officials at Department of Homeland Security headquarters who expressed concern over Tania’s experience and saw to it that she was paroled into the U.S.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[7](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A4%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="4"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[7] -->
<p>At first, Corchado believed the move was a sign that even Trump’s top officials recognized the inherent danger in the &#8220;Remain in Mexico&#8221; program and that they would step in to prevent further harm to vulnerable people. Instead, the support stopped and cases like Tania’s became the norm.</p>
<p>In the past year, one of Corchado’s senior attorneys was forced to hide out for hours in Juárez while armed men roamed the streets. Two weeks ago, that same attorney made a return visit to assess the caseload at local shelters. He was so inundated with desperate migrants seeking help that he required a police escort to return to the border. “It’s such a heavy burden to carry,” Corchado said. “That’s why we&#8217;re just so heartbroken — because we’re dealing with a government with so many resources, and here is one attorney trying to make a difference and he can&#8217;t even do it.”</p>
<p>“We’re tired,” she said. “We’re burnt out. We’ve experienced extraordinary levels of vicarious trauma, and we’re looking to the government for solutions, yet here we are, still trying to do the best that we can.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>In the days</u> leading up to the January 6, 2021, siege of the U.S. Capitol, officials inside the Department of Homeland Security were feeling anxious. Within the department’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis, the sole component of the federal government authorized to disseminate threat information to state and local law enforcement agencies, analysts had watched as maps of the Capitol were circulated online amid talk of hanging Democrats, murdering protesters, and dying in a blaze of glory.</p>
<p>The Homeland Security officials warned each other to be vigilant going to and from work as the “Stop the Steal” rally to protest the results of the 2020 election approached. Expecting violence, some planned to stay home when the day finally came. Despite the measures they planned to take for their own safety, however, and the abundant evidence that January 6 was a powder keg waiting to blow, the federal office responsible for warning the rest of the government about dangerous events decided to keep its concerns to itself.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>These are the findings of a DHS Office of Inspector General report released Tuesday that calls for “essential changes” to I&amp;A, the department’s troubled intelligence office. The <a href="https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2022-03/OIG-22-29-Mar22-Redacted.pdf">50-page report</a> documents how the various divisions of I&amp;A — from open-source intelligence “collectors,” to its counterterrorism wing, to officials posted at “fusion centers” around the country — repeatedly encountered evidence of preparations for violence at the Capitol and chose not to report that information to a wider audience.</p>
<p>As early as December 21, 2020, according to the report, I&amp;A officials internally circulated information about an individual describing plans to kill protesters by the dozens; calls to bring weapons to Washington, D.C.; an increase in weapons brandished by individuals already in the capital; and threats of violence against “ideological adversaries,” law enforcement agents, and government officials. None of that information made it outside the office prior to January 6, however. While one I&amp;A official did submit information about the various threats to be approved for a report on January 5, the inspector general noted, that release was not approved and disseminated until two days after the siege, at which point <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/05/us/politics/jan-6-capitol-deaths.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">four people</a> who were at the event were dead, including one who was shot by a Capitol police officer.</p>
<p>“In the weeks before the events at the U.S. Capitol, I&amp;A identified specific open source threat information related to January 6 but did not issue any intelligence products about these threats until January 8,” the report said. “On several occasions leading up to January 6, collectors messaged each other about the threats they discovered online.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[1] -->
<p>The inspector general pointed to two core explanations for I&amp;A’s inaction: a rushed hiring push in 2019 that put inexperienced and untrained officials on the job and public backlash following the office’s targeting of journalists covering the George Floyd protests in 2020.</p>
<p>The report is the latest blow for I&amp;A, which has long been the subject of criticism for its troubled relationship to constitutionally protected protest activities and among those who see the post-9/11 office as unnecessarily duplicative in a world where the FBI already exists. In the summer of 2020, I&amp;A was embroiled in controversy when <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/dhs-compiled-intelligence-reports-on-journalists-who-published-leaked-documents/2020/07/30/5be5ec9e-d25b-11ea-9038-af089b63ac21_story.html">documents leaked</a> showing that analysts had created files on journalists covering the George Floyd protests. Soon after that, Brian Murphy, the head of I&amp;A at the time, <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/09/12/homeland-security-whistleblower-corruption/">filed a whistleblower complaint</a> alleging that the two top officials at DHS pressured his analysts to downplay intelligence involving threats from the far right and to amplify intelligence supporting the president’s reelection messaging on the dangerousness of left-wing agitators. The DHS political appointees in question, Chad Wolf and Ken Cuccinelli, denied the allegation.</p>

<p>“As Secretary Mayorkas has said, the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021 was a violent assault on our democracy,” a DHS spokesperson said in a statement to The Intercept. “Over the past fourteen months, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has strengthened intelligence analysis, information sharing, and operational preparedness to help prevent acts of violence and keep our communities safe.”</p>
<p>In addition to implementing a first of its kind <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/15/fact-sheet-national-strategy-for-countering-domestic-terrorism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism</a>, the official noted that since the Capitol siege, I&amp;A has conducted “more than 70 engagements with partners across every level of government, in the private sector, and local communities regarding emerging threat,” while the department as whole has issued “more than 95 intelligence products related to domestic violent extremism.”</p>
<p>In December, President Joe Biden <a href="https://about.bgov.com/news/backwater-intelligence-office-faces-test-under-biden-nominee/">nominated Kenneth Wainstein</a>, a former adviser to President George W. Bush and chief of staff to longtime FBI Director Robert Mueller, to take over the intelligence office.</p>
<p>Rep. Bennie Thompson, chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, welcomed the inspector general’s report. “I’m glad that the IG made it clear that our intelligence agencies under the previous administration should have done much more before the January 6th attack on the capitol,” Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, said in a statement to The Intercept. &#8220;Thankfully, Office of Intelligence and Analysis has agreed with IG’s recommendations and I look forward to working with it on implementing them.”</p>

Ron Wyden, a sharp critic of surveillance excesses at DHS — from Customs and Border Protection’s <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/03/11/southern-us-border-mexico-journalists/">targeting of journalists, lawyers, and immigration advocates at the border</a> to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement program that <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hamedaleaziz/ice-western-union-records-wyden?ref=bfnsplash">vacuumed up millions of Americans’ financial records</a> — said the report was indicative of a pattern of problems at the nation’s largest law enforcement agency that had impacted his own hometown.</p>
<p>“The new Inspector General Report is another reminder that multiple federal agencies failed to appropriately respond to the very real, public threats to the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021,” Wyden said in a statement to The Intercept. “That failure came only a few months after DHS officials inappropriately collected and shared intelligence about reporters and other people who posed no threat to homeland security in Portland.”</p>
<p>“Clearly DHS Intelligence activities need an overhaul to ensure that the department is focused on real threats, not harassing reporters and non-violent protesters,” the senator added. “The public also deserves more information about DHS’s intelligence activities, and I am pleased that Ken Wainstein, the nominee to head the Department’s intelligence office, has committed to me to conduct an immediate review on how to increase transparency.”</p>
<p><u>The inspector general’s</u> findings indicate that the dysfunction that plagued I&amp;A in the summer of 2020 continued into the winter of 2021.</p>
<p>In one passage, the report presents a series of messages that two “collectors,” officials responsible for trawling through open-source information to identify domestic security threats, exchanged late on the night of January 2, after one of the officials noticed that people were sharing a map of the Capitol online.</p>
<p>“I feel like people are actually going to try and hurt politicians,” the official who came across the map wrote. “Jan 6th is gonna be crazy, not to mention the inauguration.”</p>
<p>The official suspected that their supervisors would order extra shifts for the event, writing, “Watch us get surged for that lol.”</p>
<p>The second official had a similar feeling, adding that the Proud Boys — a right-wing street-fighting gang — were in town the night before. A few hours later, the first official wrote again.</p>
<p>“Like there’s these people talking about hanging Democrats from ropes like wtf,” they said.</p>
<p>“They’d need alot of rope,” the second official replied. “I think DC is pretty much all democrat haha.”</p>

<p>By 2:53 a.m., the first official had arrived at a succinct description of the threats they were seeing: “I mean people are talking about storming Congress, bringing guns, willing to die for the cause, hanging politicians with ropes,” they wrote.</p>
<p>According to the inspector general, neither official considered filing a report describing what they were seeing. “When reviewing threats pertaining to January 6 events, the collectors generally concluded that the statements online were hyperbole, and not true threats or incitement, because they thought storming the U.S. Capitol and other threats were unlikely or not possible,” the report said.</p>
<p>One collector who spoke to the oversight investigators recalled describing to a colleague how “nervous” they were after seeing a group of people who looked “like they are going to battle” post about their arrival in Washington. “Yet, these collectors did not draft any intelligence products reflecting possible safety concerns in the area,” the report said.</p>
<p>The inspector general traced some of the inaction to shift changes in the summer of 2019 that resulted in an exodus of collectors from I&amp;A. The office responded with a hiring blitz, bringing in replacements “mostly at entry level positions, with many not having Federal government or intelligence experience.”</p>
<p>“As of January 6, 2021, 16 out of 21 collectors had less than 1 year of experience, and some of these new collectors said they did not receive adequate training to help determine when threat information should be reported,” the report said.</p>

<p>Fallout from the summer of 2020 disclosures — which included <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/18/997553438/report-dhs-division-failed-to-analyze-intelligence-ahead-of-capitol-violence">hearings on Capitol Hill</a> and <a href="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2021/images/10/01/internal.review.report.20210930.pdf">a separate inspector general report</a> published, ironically, on January 6, 2021 — may have also played a role in the inaction. Out of the 24 collectors the inspector general interviewed, 22 said that their reporting approach “was affected by the scrutiny they received” the previous summer, when DHS deployed <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/07/25/portland-federal-agents-antifa-border/">Border Patrol tactical teams in response to protests in Portland, Oregon,</a> and compiled “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/dhs-compiled-intelligence-reports-on-journalists-who-published-leaked-documents/2020/07/30/5be5ec9e-d25b-11ea-9038-af089b63ac21_story.html">intelligence reports</a>” on members of the media. When considering the potential for violent actors mixed in with racial justice protests, it was an anything goes approach, the collectors said; in the runup to January 6 there was a “pendulum swing” in the other direction.</p>
<p>“They explained that they thought almost anything was reportable during the Portland protests, but they were hesitant or fearful to report information related to January 6 events,” the report said. “One collector said people were afraid to do their jobs because of the fear of being reprimanded by I&amp;A leadership and concerns about congressional scrutiny. Another explained there was a ‘chilling effect’ on their approach to reporting following the summer of 2020.”</p>
<p>Despite I&amp;A’s failure to do its core job in one of the most important moments in the nearly two-decade existence of DHS, the inspector general’s recommendations for correcting course were mild, focusing mostly on improved training and guidance. The inspector general did, however, gesture at the historical significance of the January 6 siege and the need for change, particularly in the event of another attempted government overthrow.</p>
<p>“I&amp;A staff disagree about whether an intelligence product from I&amp;A would have affected the outcome on January 6,” the report said. “Nonetheless, the issues we found during our review demonstrate the need for essential changes at I&amp;A to ensure it is better equipped to respond to similar events in the future.”</p>

It was two days into 2019, and the line she was about to cross separating San Diego and Tijuana was the site of a politicized battle over the arrival of thousands of asylum-seekers playing out on televisions screens around the world. Dousa, a prominent New York City pastor, was more than a month into her latest round of border ministry, providing religious services to mostly Central American families whom the president had cast as a national security threat and federal agents had tear-gassed the previous day.</p>
<p>The work was tiring enough, but as Dousa made her way through the sprawling San Ysidro port of entry, a bundle of nerves sharpened her discomfort. It was her first time crossing back from Mexico alone. She promised her husband she would return before dark and that she would give him, and their 4-year-old daughter, a call when she did. With dusk already settling in, that was beginning to feel increasingly unlikely.</p>
<p>Dousa wasn’t wearing her clerical collar when she approached the U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer on duty. The conversation was cordial, with the two making small talk until something on the man’s computer caught his eye. Suddenly, the officer’s demeanor changed. He told Dousa to come with him. The pastor was led to a lobby where other would-be border crossers were waiting. She decided she might need the collar after all. She asked the official who seemed to be in charge why she was there. The man told her to sit down and suggested she look up what “secondary” inspection meant. When Dousa took a seat and pulled out her phone, the officer barked at her to put it away.</p>
<p>As travelers trickled in and out of the room, Dousa remained. Eventually, a new CBP official arrived. He stood out from the others, a Black man in khaki pants and a polo instead of the dark uniforms of the agency’s mostly white and Latino officers. Dousa didn’t know it at the time, but the officer’s name was Jeremy Burnett, and he was a veteran interviewer in a secretive CBP counterterrorism unit. He had been called up specifically for her interview.</p>
<p>Burnett led Dousa to a warren of low-walled cubicles, where they each took a seat. His vibe suggested that he knew what he was doing, Dousa thought. “He seemed, for lack of a better word, smarter than your typical sort of person at the front end of things,” she told The Intercept. “He was savvier.”</p>
<p>The officer began with the basics: where Dousa was from, how many times she had crossed the border. Occasionally he appeared to read from his computer screen. Burnett then asked the pastor about her work in Mexico, questioning whether she was coaching migrants to cross the border illegally. She told him that she was not, that she was providing ministry to people in need. She and her colleagues did advise asylum-seekers how to efficiently relay their stories in official interviews, Dousa explained, a legal activity for which government officials like Burnett should be grateful because it made their lives easier. Burnett seemed satisfied with the answer; Dousa sensed an opening in the conversation. She told him that in New York she regularly met with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials as part of her work in undocumented communities. She understood that things were different now, she said, under the current administration, and that sometimes that was rough on people in his position. Dousa told the officer that she hoped he was showing kindness and compassion to the people he met. Burnett, she thought, seemed to be listening.</p>
<p>Just then, Burnett’s partner, Allen Tamayo, poked his head over the low partition separating the cubicles. He was taking notes the whole time, Dousa realized. The heart-to-heart she was having with Burnett ended. She hoped he would remember it forever. Burnett handed the pastor back her travel documents and told her she was free to leave. Dousa left her business card with the counterterrorism officers and told them to call anytime if she needed to clear anything up.</p>
<p>Burnett would later recall his questioning in sworn testimony before a federal court. “I felt like she was being truthful in the interview,” he said. “I didn’t feel like she was being deceiving to me.” Dousa’s was one of many interviews Burnett’s Tactical Terrorism Response Team was doing at the time. The push to probe came not from the officers but from a special task force of Border Patrol agents, Homeland Security investigators, and FBI agents, cobbled together in response to the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2018/10/25/from-caravans-to-cages-why-trump-bashes-migrants/">migrant caravans</a> — and then-President Donald Trump’s ensuing <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/23/trump-caravan-midterm-elections-875888">speeches</a> — that were all over the news. The interviews were one spoke in a wider wheel of surveillance targeting dozens of immigration attorneys, asylum advocates, and journalists on the border — most of whom were singled out without evidence that they had committed a crime, let alone a formal investigation or prosecution for anything remotely as serious as terrorism.</p>
<p>Throughout her interview, Dousa tried her best to stay cool. Outside the port building, her anxiety came crashing down. Her body shook as she dialed her husband’s number. The line rang without answer. The pastor steeled herself and continued on alone.</p>

<h2>A Microphone in the Confessional</h2>
<p>A quiet drama unfolding at the intersection of faith, surveillance, and borders, Kaji Dousa’s experience that night in San Diego began a legal fight that continues to this day. As she would later learn, the pastor was one of at least 51 U.S. citizens who were targeted and tracked by their own government for their proximity to asylum-seekers in late 2018 and early 2019.</p>
<p>Dousa is a plaintiff in <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21350360-dousa-complaint">a federal lawsuit</a> alleging that the border dragnet violated her constitutional rights as a faith leader ministering to migrants by placing her on a secret blacklist, revoking her expedited border-crossing privileges, and calling on Mexican law enforcement to detain her. Through her litigation, filed in the Southern District of California, the pastor and her lawyers have unearthed substantial evidence of reckless intelligence sharing between authorities on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico divide.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 pages of recently unsealed testimony from U.S. officials deposed in the case and internal CBP communications shared with The Intercept provide an inside look at “Operation Secure Line”: a secretive, politicized, international law enforcement effort carried out during the peak of Trump-era caravan mania. The materials reveal an effort that was chaotic, unfocused, and dangerous for the people caught in its crosshairs. The testimony and communications add names, dates, and context to a Department of Homeland Security Inspector General’s investigation that was <a href="https://www.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2021-09/OIG-21-62-Sep21.pdf">published</a> in September. While the DHS watchdog found significant flaws in the implementation of Operation Secure Line, evidence in Dousa’s case suggests that the problems went deeper than the report indicated. Her case points to potential gaps in the office’s investigation, and Dousa’s legal team alleges that a senior CBP official at the center of the operation at best misled and at worst lied when he told the court that the pastor’s travel privileges were not affected by the surveillance program. The court cited his testimony as reason not to reinstate Dousa’s travel privileges — an issue that is the subject of ongoing litigation.</p>
<p>As recently as late last year, the officials involved in Dousa’s ordeal and the wider caravan surveillance episode, including those at the center of the most concerning parts of the inspector general’s report, remained on the job. In some cases, their responsibilities at the border expanded and their stature at CBP grew. The supervisor who oversaw San Diego’s ports while asylum advocates and journalists were routinely being detained and questioned, for example, is now one of CBP’s top officials in Washington, D.C., overseeing a force of 31,000 uniformed and nonuniformed personnel and managing the agency’s $6.5 billion budget for operations nationwide. Citing the ongoing nature of Dousa’s case, CBP declined to answer any questions for this article, including whether the agency implemented any policy changes following the inspector general’s report or disciplined any officials for conduct related to Operation Secure Line.</p>

<p>Under Trump, humanitarian aid providers and immigration activists faced <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2018/01/23/no-more-deaths-arizona-border-littering-charges-immigration/">federal prosecutions in the courts</a> and <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/11/02/deportation-occupy-ice-daca/">snatch-and-grab deportations on the streets</a>. For Dousa, the core harm of her experience was the threat that government surveillance poses to a pastor like her; it’s the reason she and her lawyers have argued that, in addition to the First Amendment’s prohibition on religious discrimination and retaliation, Dousa’s rights were also violated under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Typically known for its use as a defense for <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2018/04/25/rfra-indiana-why-law-signed-mike-pence-so-controversial/546411002/">conservative causes</a>, RFRA has twice been used in recent years to successfully defend spiritually rooted border advocacy in federal court: first, in the case of <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/11/23/scott-warren-verdict-immigration-border/">Scott Warren</a>, a humanitarian aid provider who <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/05/04/no-more-deaths-scott-warren-migrants-border-arizona/">faced 20 years in prison</a> for providing food, water, and shelter to migrants crossing the deadliest stretch of the Sonoran Desert; and second, in the case of <a href="https://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/011922_ortega_hearing/native-activist-found-not-guilty-border-protest-after-new-arguments-religious-freedom-defense/">Amber Ortega</a>, a member of the Hia Ced O’odham tribe, who was arrested, strip searched, and <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/09/16/indigenous-activists-border-wall-protest/">held incommunicado</a> in a for-profit jail for <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/11/24/arizona-border-wall-native-activists/">protesting border wall construction</a> on sacred O’odham land in southern Arizona. Ministering to migrants is not just a part of Dousa’s job, her lawsuit argues. It’s also her religious calling, and it too is protected under the law.</p>
<p>Engaging in know-your-rights trainings, spiritual counsel, or journalism are among the most legally protected acts one can partake in, argued Brian Griffey, senior researcher at Amnesty International. Yet those are the exact activities the state zeroed in on in the cases of Dousa and others — all without any consequences.</p>

<p>In 2019, Griffey authored a report examining the Trump administration’s “<a href="https://www.amnestyusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Amnesty-Report_SLINAC_FINAL005.pdf">unlawful and politically motivated campaign</a>” of targeting border activists, particularly through Operation Secure Line. Following its publication, he received a tranche of DHS documents that provided an even deeper look at the president’s controversial border initiative. The documents, which have not been previously reported upon, reveal how U.S. and Mexican law enforcement, military, and intelligence agencies used aerial surveillance, social media monitoring, and informants to construct detailed portraits of the migrant caravans as they moved through Mexico, documenting populations in need of medical care and under lethal threats from Mexican organized crime. Rather than preparing for their evident needs and accommodating their right to seek refuge, Griffey noted, U.S. officials devoted their time and resources to tracking journalists, immigration lawyers, and activists.</p>
<p>“They were no longer conducting border security,” Griffey told The Intercept. “They were functioning like an intelligence agency that was assembling invasive dossiers on people who had no clear instance of violating the law.”</p>
<p>The Secure Line officials who organized these efforts have faced no known repercussions, Griffey noted. “An accurate approximation would be zero accountability,” he said. Perhaps most concerning, he added, is the fact that the conditions that drove asylum-seekers and advocates like Dousa to the border in 2018 remain the same in 2022: Thanks to <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/04/18/biden-border-patrol-asylum-title-42/">successively</a> harsher <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/09/21/biden-haiti-texas-del-rio-asylum/">restrictions</a> in the U.S., simply beginning an asylum case at the border is next impossible without serious legal and moral support. “The Biden administration has abandoned a lot of its promises to lift these unlawful Trump policies,” he said. “It continues to implement them to this day.”</p>

<p>When her surveillance first became public in 2019, Dousa argues in her lawsuit, her ability to assure people that they could unburden their deepest traumas and sins to her was rattled to its core. “I wasn’t sure that the surveillance didn’t include listening in on conversations,” she said. Her entire ministry began to change, as Dousa encouraged parishioners to download encrypted messaging apps to communicate with her. “I would have to advise people, ‘I’m not so sure that this conversation will be completely private,’ or I would have to meet them in places that I felt would be safer,” she said. Worried that whatever was happening behind the scenes at the Department of Homeland Security could affect their cases, Dousa advised undocumented people pursuing a green card to find spiritual support elsewhere.</p>
<p>“Worship changed significantly,” Dousa said. As one congregant told her at the time, it felt as though “they put a microphone in the confessional.”</p>

<h2>Blast Radius</h2>
<p>A fusion of faith and activism runs in Kaji Dousa’s family. Her grandfather, Edwin Edmonds, was a <a href="https://www.ucc.org/doc-edmonds/">renowned figure</a> in the United Church of Christ, who devoted much his life to the civil rights movement and exchanged letters with Martin Luther King Jr. Her mother was an organizer and communications director for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, one of the movement’s most important organizations, which weathered its own heavy government surveillance through the 1960s. “I just grew up with granddad both of course preaching on Sundays, but also always having community meetings in the house,” Dousa said.</p>
<p>The pastor’s first brush with the homeland security state came nearly 3,000 miles from the border, in New York City, years before the caravans arrived in Tijuana and San Diego. Early in the Obama administration, a regular at Dousa’s Manhattan church was placed in deportation proceedings. Her efforts to save the man from removal led her to the New Sanctuary Coalition, one of the city’s leading immigrant rights organizations. Bit by bit, Dousa learned about the complex world of immigration enforcement, detention, and deportation. For her, the realities of that system — which routinely involves the capture, caging, and state-sanctioned exile of poor people— was fundamentally at odds with the doctrine of “imago dei,” the belief at the heart of her faith, which holds that every human being bears the image of God. To Dousa, deporting an undocumented mother or father in Queens or Brooklyn was no different than deporting Christ himself, the son of God and a refugee.</p>
<p>Dousa threw herself into work with New Sanctuary and soon became co-chair of the organization.</p>
<p>Her immigration experience led her to “The Table,” a UCC church in La Mesa, California, 40 miles north of Tijuana, where she was senior minister from 2013 through 2016. Dousa was on the border as tens of thousands of unaccompanied Central American children and families arrived seeking asylum in 2014. While anti-immigrant protesters chanting “go home” <a href="https://time.com/2949117/san-diego-migrant-buses-protests/">blocked buses carrying migrant children</a>, she and her congregants brought supplies to Mexican migrant shelters and connected Central American kids with families in the U.S. In November 2016, Dousa returned to New York to serve as senior pastor at the Park Avenue Christian Church, becoming the first woman to lead the congregation since its founding in 1810. She arrived just in time for the election of Donald Trump, a man who campaigned on vows to seal the border and spent his first week in office signing executive orders <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2017/01/29/trumps-muslim-ban-triggers-chaos-heartbreak-and-resistance/">banning travelers from Muslim countries</a> and <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2017/02/09/trump-administration-prepares-to-execute-vicious-executive-order-on-deportations/">expanding ICE’s enforcement priorities</a> to include virtually every undocumented immigrant in the country.</p>
<p>In June 2017, <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2017/06/17/arizona-border-patrol-raid-surveillance-no-more-deaths-humanitarian-immigration/">Border Patrol agents raided a humanitarian aid station in the Arizona desert</a> run by No More Deaths, a faith-based organization born from the same 1980s immigrant rights movement that inspired Dousa’s New Sanctuary Coalition in NYC. With rifle-toting agents on the ground and helicopters hovering above, the operation signaled that the blast radius of Trump’s immigration crackdown would be wide, and that it would include the work of advocates as well. In the fall and winter of that year, members of New Sanctuary began <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2018/01/19/ice-new-sanctuary-movement-ravi-ragbir-deportation/">noticing unmarked vehicles with tinted windows</a> lurking outside Judson Memorial Church, their center of operations in lower Manhattan, and the homes of the coalition’s organizers. On January 3, 2018, ICE arrested Jean Montrevil, one of the group’s leading figures, outside of his home in Queens, months before his regularly scheduled check-in with the agency. Within days, Montrevil, a father of four who had lived in the U.S. for more than three decades, was deported to Haiti. One week later, ICE made an even more provocative move, taking into custody Ravi Ragbir, Dousa’s co-chair at New Sanctuary and then-executive director of the organization, at a routine check-in. In the protest that followed, New York City police <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/arrests-and-protests-follow-detention-immigrant-activist/">arrested 18 people</a>, including two city council members. (Following lawsuits alleging that they were targeted for their activism, both Montrevil and Ragbir were <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/02/24/ice-ravi-ragbir-deportation-first-amendment/">granted three years of deferred action</a> in their immigration cases; Montrevil was <a href="https://documentedny.com/2021/12/20/haitian-immigration-activist-given-three-years-of-deferred-action/">reunited with his family</a> in the U.S. in December.)</p>
<p>Through the arrests, Dousa came into increasingly close contact with the top brass at ICE’s New York City office. In the lawsuit she would file years later, she describes a meeting she had with Scott Mechkowski, ICE’s deputy field office director for New York at the time, shortly before Montrevil’s deportation. According to the pastor, Mechkowski spent much of the conversation lamenting ICE’s depiction in the press, before telling her: “I know exactly how to find you. You’re on the web. You’re all over the documents that I have. … Trust me, I know your network just as good as you do.” ICE did not respond to a request for comment on the deputy director’s remarks.</p>
<p>For Dousa, Mechkowski’s words came off like threat. “It was so scary,” the pastor said. “I was actually terrified for the whole conversation.” To her, it was clearest sign yet of a targeted effort to monitor and intimidate immigrant rights advocates; it wouldn’t be the last.</p>

<h2>Secure the Line</h2>
<p>While Dousa and New Sanctuary were navigating ICE surveillance and arrests in New York, pressure on the border was mounting.</p>
<p>In spring of 2018, the first of two large sets of caravans of mostly Central American asylum-seekers began arriving in border cities in northern Mexico. While migrant caravans through Mexico were not unheard of, past iterations were largely convened to highlight the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/07/14/trump-remain-in-mexico-policy/">dangers that migrants traversing the country routinely face</a> — including extortion, robbery, assault, rape, mass murder, and criminal impunity — and they often ended in Mexico City.</p>
<p>As a safety-in-numbers strategy, the 2018 caravans were much larger than their predecessors and went all the way to the border itself. In an administration where border policy was designed by Stephen Miller, a man who took his talking points from<a href="https://www.splcenter.org/stephen-miller-breitbart-emails"> white nationalist literature</a> predicting the fall of civilization at the hands of migrant hordes, the caravans provided a pretext to ratchet up the immigration crackdown even further, including through the forced separation of thousands of children from their parents. By the fall, caravan coverage was <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/11/26/18112360/fox-news-caravan-coverage-border-tear-gas">dominating Fox News</a> and the mind of the president, who <a href="https://thehill.com/latino/411990-trump-threatens-military-action-at-border-if-mexico-doesnt-stop-immigration-onslaught">threatened</a> to use the military to seal the border. In late October, David Shaw, then-Special Agent in Charge of ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations office in San Diego, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21350742-ice-shaw-oct-26-nuclear-option_redacted">wrote a message</a> to his staff about DHS deploying teams to Central America and Mexico City and the possibility of 500 new agents boarding planes to the Southwest. “There is not a defined mission for them nor do we know exactly where they would be going,” he said, adding, “DC throwing around idea of a ‘nuclear option’ to close the border if the caravan comes near.”</p>
<p>With the midterm elections in full swing, DHS and the Pentagon announced the launch of “<a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2018/10/29/trump-manufacturing-border-crisis-families-caravan/">Operation Faithful Patriot</a>,” a deployment of 5,000 solders to the southern border, on November 6, 2018. The name of the initiative was <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/spotlights/migrant-caravan-continues-toward-us-border-cbp-partners-dod-secure-line">later changed</a> to “Operation Secure Line.” With support from ICE’s HSI wing and the FBI, CBP created an “Emergency Operations Center” in San Diego to coordinate the mission. The Border Patrol’s San Diego-based Foreign Operations Branch liaised with authorities on the Mexican side of the border. Both countries had staff working around the clock monitoring the caravans’ progress, checking in with <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/feds-have-paid-undercover-informants-migrant-caravan-n938416">informants</a>, and combing through social media to identify potential organizers of the exodus.</p>

<p>More than three years later, depositions in Dousa’s lawsuit reveal a messy operation. Throughout Secure Line, the CBP official responsible for San Diego’s ports was <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/about/leadership-organization/executive-assistant-commissioners-offices/field-operations">Pete Flores</a>. In December, Flores was promoted to <a href="https://twitter.com/ofoeac">executive assistant commissioner</a> for CBP’s Office of Field Operations, the main component of the agency. Among other things, his duties include overseeing the National Targeting Center, a quasi-intelligence office focused on identifying national security threats at the border. Miguel Haro, the deputy section chief of the Emergency Operations Center, was one of several CBP officers who filed reports to Flores and other senior officials. According to the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21352814-haro-miguel-depo-transcript-redacted">testimony Haro gave</a> in Dousa’s case in August, the center’s job was to create “daily” presentations for CBP leadership, “informing on demonstrations and trying to identify organizers for the caravan.” Haro could not recall ever receiving training on exactly how to do this. Nonetheless, when individuals who could be caravan organizers were identified, he and his colleagues placed “lookouts” on their internal CBP files.</p>
<p>When those individuals attempted a border crossing, Haro often called up Burnett’s Tactical Terrorism Response Team to interview them. TTRT officers were instructed to ask the targets whether they were coaching migrants to cross the border illegally. According to the inspector general’s report released last year, “Two TTRT officers who conducted caravan-related interviews did not believe there was a need to interview many of those individuals multiple times.” One added that the counterterrorism team “did not obtain any valuable information during the follow-up interviews.” A third said “he called EOC officials on multiple occasions to ask them to remove lookouts, but they did not do so.” Burnett, the veteran CBP counterterrorism officer who interviewed Dousa, said in <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21352817-burnett-jeremy-lamont-depo-transcript-sept-2-2021-redacted">his deposition</a> that the pressure from the Emergency Operations Center was not well received. “The team wasn’t interested in it,” he testified. “We were instructed by our management or chain of command to do it.”</p>
<p>In a briefing on November 20, 2018, Haro’s Emergency Operations Center painted a messy picture of the situation in Tijuana-San Diego area. The center had received information from the Mexican Army that “approximately 1000 migrants” were “planning to rush the Port of Entry.” EOC officials also noted that “cartels in Tijuana are threating [sic] the migrants to go back or they will be killed.” Shaw, the special agent in charge at Homeland Security Investigations, ordered his agents to begin working their sources. “We would like to compile a list of credible information obtained from any Confidential Informants (CIs) and/or Sources of Information (SOIs) regarding the incoming migrant caravans and/or cartel actions related to the caravans,” he <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21350867-nov-20-ice-requests-informant-info_redacted">wrote in an email</a> following the briefing.</p>
<p>Dousa knew none of these behind-the-scenes details when she stepped off her plane at the San Diego airport on the night of November 26, 2018. The reason for her arrival was the “<a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-faith-leaders-administer-aid-and-wedding-vows-to-sanctuary-caravan-in-tijuana">Sanctuary Caravan</a>,” a multidenominational mission of faith leaders who came to provide ministry and support to asylum-seekers camped out in Tijuana. Over the course of 40 days and 40 nights, Dousa and her fellow clergy members accompanied asylum-seekers to the port and joined them in prayer. “I was meeting with migrants, praying with them,” Dousa said. “I officiated for several marriages.” The marriage ceremonies were spiritual affairs, she said, ritual blessings for couples at the end of a long journey and the beginning of a new one, not state-licensed or official in any capacity.</p>
<p>On her first full day on the border, Dousa <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-faith-leaders-administer-aid-and-wedding-vows-to-sanctuary-caravan-in-tijuana">visited a bridge</a> overlooking the Tijuana River. The day before the pastor arrived, hundreds of migrants had marched on San Diego’s ports to protest a lack of asylum access, eventually congregating in the dried-out riverbed separating the two nations. Though some migrants in the group threw rocks, most were simply caught in the middle of what happened next, as CBP officers <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/26/18112474/tear-gas-border-patrol-caravan-rocks">lobbed tear gas and rubber bullets</a> into Mexico to disperse the crowd. Women with small children ran for cover as the choking clouds descended. Mexican authorities arrested nearly 40 people on charges of forcibly attempting to enter the U.S.</p>
<p>As asylum-seekers gathered in Tijuana’s streets and shelters in the winter of 2018, a view hardened within the homeland security apparatus that the people on the other side of the border wall were a magnet for criminality. By November 29, U.S. and Mexican officials were on high alert. At a meeting with local stakeholders — including San Diego police officers, sheriff’s deputies, and the fire department — the EOC reported that Mexican drones were hovering above shelters in Tijuana, while homeland security aircraft were providing aerial surveillance from the U.S. side. The situation on the ground was desperate. More than 6,000 migrants were living in and around a Tijuana stadium, nearly double the facility’s capacity, among them more than 1,000 children. Local medical officials reported migrants with a range of needs, from chickenpox and lice to tuberculosis and HIV.</p>
<p>Several demonstrations were planned that day, the EOC reported in a 21-page briefing, including a hunger strike and a march of women and children. The EOC warned that “an unknown number of” MS-13 gang members had entered Tijuana with the caravan with plans to penetrate the border. Alongside the shaky intelligence on a threat from Salvadoran gangsters, were the biographical details of 10 “caravan organizers.” Many were associated with Pueblo Sin Fronteras, which the briefing described as “an immigration rights group” that “builds shelters for refugees on the trek north to the Mexico/American border and provide legal counsel to them.”</p>
<p>In the end, the most violent acts associated with the caravan were directed not at the border but at the people hoping to cross it. In late December, 16-year-old Jorge Alexander Ruiz and 17-year-old Jasson Ricardo Acuña Polanco, both Honduran asylum-seekers, were <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/02/23/unaccompanied-minor-migrants-us-border-policy/">lured from a youth shelter in Tijuana</a> and brutally murdered.</p>
<p>At the time, the organization Human Rights First had documented more than 630 cases of asylum-seekers and migrants being murdered, raped, tortured, kidnapped, or assaulted as a result of U.S. “turn-back” policies at the border. Today, that number stands at more than 10,200, with the vast majority of the violence — <a href="https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/resource/shameful-record-biden-administration-s-use-trump-policies-endangers-people-seeking-asylum">more than 8,700 cases and counting</a> — documented under the Biden administration.</p>

<h2>Surveillance in Bloom</h2>
<p>In the predawn hours of January 1, 2019, while much of the country was still ringing in the new year, CBP again fired chemical agents over the San Diego-Tijuana border. Witnesses on the ground that night reported both that the gassing was unprovoked, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/01/us-mexico-border-migrant-caravan-tijuana-tear-gas">contradicted statements CBP made to the press</a>, and that <a href="https://www.kpbs.org/news/2019/jan/02/witnesses-say-us-authorities-misconstrued-new-year/">activists from the U.S.</a> were helping migrants scale the border fence.</p>
<p>Within CBP, a belief that activists with U.S. passports were involved in illegal border crossings at best and plotting violent incursions at worst, had already taken root when Dousa first set foot on the border. By the time she crossed the line on January 2, less than 24 hours after the second gassing, it was in full bloom.</p>
<p>By that point, Miguel Haro had already added the pastor to a photo lineup in a growing volume of caravan-related intelligence documents. In his deposition, he explained that Dousa was not suspected of instigating a violent rush on the border. Instead, she had come to his attention through a string of secondhand information that Haro made minimal efforts to verify or substantiate.</p>
<p>On December 2, Haro received an email from the Border Patrol’s San Diego Sector Intelligence Unit reporting that a woman in the caravan who had been taken into custody had made a comment about the presence of U.S. pastors at a wedding in Tijuana. The woman didn’t have any names, but she did have a business card. The name on the card read Kaji Dousa. Haro looked her up online. The following morning, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21351235-exhibit-4-cbp_0000826_redacted-with-cbp">he emailed colleagues</a> to report that while the woman was unable to identify Dousa by name, she “did describe a woman fitting the description of Dousa” at the wedding. Haro included a link to <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-faith-leaders-administer-aid-and-wedding-vows-to-sanctuary-caravan-in-tijuana">an article</a> by Gothamist, a New York City news website, describing Dousa’s work with the Sanctuary Caravan. “You can see a woman who resembles her in the picture from the article,” he wrote. On December 5, Haro’s colleague, Nicolas Gonzalez Jr., reported that he had “suspended” Dousa’s membership in the expedited travel program known as “Global Access.”</p>
<p>Four days later, Haro received another email from the Border Patrol. The woman in custody had identified Dousa in a photo lineup as present at the wedding and had in her possession a fraudulent marriage certificate. “The certificate displays Kanji [sic] Dousa’s name as one of the pastors present,” the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21351291-exhibit-5-cbp_0012265_redacted-with-cbp">agent said</a>. According to filings in Dousa’s lawsuit, Haro never sought to interview the woman in custody to substantiate her allegation; as he made clear in his deposition, despite his title as deputy section chief of the EOC and the intelligence access that came with the position, Haro possessed neither the training nor the legal authority to conduct criminal investigations. He wasn’t sure the woman’s claim was evidence that Dousa committed a crime, but he decided the pastor would remain in an internal homeland security database as a “possible coordinator” of the caravans anyway. When asked why, he testified, “I didn’t give it much thought.”</p>

<p>If Dousa came to the border to participate in some sort of “cross-border-marriage-fraud-asylum” scheme, she did a poor job hiding it. Following the arrival of the Sanctuary Caravan in late November, Al Otro Lado, one of the San Diego-Tijuana area’s leading immigrant rights organizations, announced on Facebook and in a press conference that clergy were in town and available to officiate wedding ceremonies. The Gothamist article Haro found also made clear that members of the Sanctuary Caravan were presiding over wedding ceremonies. “It wasn’t like it was a state-licensed marriage,” Dousa said. Few spiritual acts are more squarely in line with protected religious activity than presiding over a wedding, she argued: “By definition, I got investigated by the government for offering the ritual of marriage to migrants.”</p>
<p>Had CBP been truly invested in the fraudulent marriage angle, one would expect the matter to feature prominently in Dousa’s interview with the Tactical Terrorism Response Team. Burnett, in his deposition, however, could not recall the subject ever coming up when Haro called upon TTRT to interview the pastor. His partner, Allen Tamayo, remembered the issue having some relationship to Dousa’s file, but once the three sat down, the officers decided not to bring it up. “It didn’t seem necessary,” Tamayo <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21352818-tamayo-allen-depo-transcript-redacted">testified</a>. “She was a very nice person. She was answering all our questions.” He added: “I felt like if we asked that question, we were going to lose rapport with Ms. Dousa.”</p>
<p>Were things to go differently, Dousa could have walked out of her interview that night never knowing what unit the men who questioned her belonged to, or how she landed on their radar. Instead, the startling scope of Operation Secure Line would soon explode into public view, beginning one of the most disturbing episodes in the pastor’s life.</p>

<h2>A Blacklist Exposed</h2>
<p>The dam holding back evidence of CBP’s caravan surveillance began to break on February 1, 2019, when two top attorneys at Al Otro Lado were <a href="https://www.latimes.com/nation/immigration/la-me-immigration-attorneys-detained-20190202-story.html">denied entry</a> into Mexico. The following week, The Intercept published <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/02/08/us-mexico-border-journalists-harassment/">an investigation based on interviews with nearly 20 sources</a> working on caravan-related issues in the San Diego-Tijuana area, including the Otro Lado lawyers, photojournalists, and asylum advocates. The sources described being shackled to benches in U.S. detention cells for hours at a time; being forced to turn over their notes, cameras, and phones; and being shown lineups of suspected caravan organizers and asked to divulge what they knew.</p>

<p>The sources’ claims were confirmed the following month, when a NBC San Diego affiliate published <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/source-leaked-documents-show-the-us-government-tracking-journalists-and-advocates-through-a-secret-database/3438/">a blockbuster report based on leaked Secure Line documents</a> showing that CBP, ICE, and FBI officials in San Diego had created a blacklist of caravan-related targets. The source of the leak was a veteran special agent in the HSI-San Diego office, who later told NBC that he raised civil liberties concerns with his supervisors when he first came across the materials, only to be told that the surveillance was “<a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/government-secrets-why-and-how-a-special-agent-turned-whistleblower-uncovered-controversial-border-surveillance-tactics/2176213/">standard practice</a>.” The documents he leaked included the photo lineups of suspected caravan organizers. Among the images in the files was a photo of Dousa with a large yellow “X” over her face. Her caravan “role” was “associate,” the document said. Her status in SENTRI, the CBP program for expedited processing at border crossings, was “revoked.”</p>

<p>The revelations made national headlines, sparking bipartisan <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/03/11/southern-us-border-mexico-journalists/">demands for answers</a>. For the first time, Dousa realized that her ordeal was part of a much wider program. “Everything changed after that,” she said. Filing suit against CBP and other elements of DHS in July 2019, Dousa called upon a federal judge to declare that the government violated her rights under the First Amendment and RFRA, order a cessation to any continued monitoring or surveillance, and reinstate her travel privileges. Government lawyers <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21351459-dousa-motion-to-dismiss">argued in a motion to dismiss</a> that Dousa’s border crossing privileges were unaffected by her inclusion in the files, and that her assertions that she was “being monitored and targeted by CBP due to the exercise of her First Amendment rights and religion” were “based on speculation, hearsay, and incidents involving other people.”</p>
<p>Shortly after filing her complaint, Dousa <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21350358-dousa-injunction-request">sought an injunction</a> against the government and requested internal records related to her questioning. She asked the court to order the government to restore her SENTRI privileges and refrain “from taking any future adverse action against” her “based on her protected expression, association, or religious exercise.” Government lawyers described Dousa&#8217;s request for records as “a colossal burden” and called up Saro Oliveri, a senior CBP official responsible for the Trusted Traveler Programs in San Diego and cross-border coordination with authorities in Mexico, in response.</p>
<p>In September 2019, just eight months after Dousa’s questioning, Oliveri said in a<a href="https://protectdemocracy.org/resource-library/document/dousa-v-dhs-mtd-declaration-of-saro-oliveri/"> sworn declaration</a> that the pastor’s travel privileges had “never been revoked or suspended” and that he queried an internal CBP database to check. Chief U.S. District Judge Larry Alan Burns granted Dousa’s records request two months later, resulting in a limited release of records, but in January 2020 denied her injunction request based largely on Oliveri’s testimony.</p>
<p>If CBP revoked Dousa’s privileges and she could show that the revocation was related to activity protected under the First Amendment, Burns wrote, the court would have “no problem” issuing an injunction — but as Oliveri’s testimony indicated, the revocation never happened.</p>
<p>Despite the setback, Dousa pressed on. In January 2021, her lawyers obtained a December 2018 email chain in which Haro circulated a photo of Dousa. The subject line read: “SENTRI poss caravan organizer.” In the message, Haro wrote, “we would like to have her interviewed to see if she is helping the coordinate the caravan in Tijuana.” The deputy EOC chief told his colleagues that Dousa’s “continued enrollment” in the program was up to their “discretion.” He followed up with the email that included the Gothamist article, adding that Border Patrol had discovered “various pictures of Kaji S. Dousa from the internet,” as well as information from her church. In a third email, Haro asked if CBP was “in a holding pattern” until Dousa could be interviewed by TTRT. It was then that Haro received the email from Nicolas Gonzalez Jr. informing him that Dousa’s travel privileges were suspended. “Today I suspended her Global access as well,” Gonzalez wrote.</p>
<p>Oliveri was copied on each of the emails. In fact, Oliveri himself wrote emails regarding Dousa’s travel privileges. One week after Gonzalez reported Dousa’s suspension, Oliveri sent a three-word message to Haro that read: “We revoked her.”</p>

<p>The communications raised major questions about the truthfulness of Oliveri’s declaration and the guidance he received from government lawyers beforehand. In June, Dousa’s lawyers got the opportunity to ask those questions themselves, when Oliveri, by that point a branch chief at the Otay Mesa port of entry overseeing the Trusted Traveler Programs, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21352815-20210630-oliveri-redacted">sat for a deposition</a> in San Diego. The senior CBP official said that the email he sent was incorrect — where that information came from, he could not recall — and that the statement he provided to the court was accurate.</p>
<p>“This is just an e-mail,” Oliveri testified. “It’s nothing that was official. I mean the record that I stated in my declaration was official records from the database under current status.” He added: “We could have been talking about someone else or mistaken.” Oliveri disagreed that his email was relevant to Dousa’s litigation and told the court that he forgot who directed him to query CBP databases for information pertinent to the case.</p>
<p>Oliveri was also asked about <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21352207-dousa-list-to-mx">an unencrypted email</a> he sent to a Mexican immigration official on December 10, 2018, which featured the names, birthdates, and nationalities of 24 caravan “organizers/instigators.” Among them were 14 U.S. citizens, including Dousa. “Most of these people are United States citizens, and it’s highly likely that they lack the proper documentation to be in Mexico,” Oliveri told his Mexican counterpart at the time. “CBP wishes to interview them all and respectfully requests that [Mexican Immigration] deny them entry into Mexico. If located, please return them to the United States so that CBP can proceed with their interview.”</p>
<p>Though Oliveri acknowledged that the request was highly unusual — he testified that he had never made one before — he claimed he forgot who had directed him to send it, where the names he sent came from, and when they were put together or why. When asked what basis he had to assert to a foreign government that the U.S. citizens on his list had no authority to be in the country and that they be stopped by law enforcement as a result, he replied: “What basis? I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“We came up with the language pretty quick,” Oliveri testified. “Being with the liaison unit, I knew it wasn’t going to go anywhere.” He added: “The Mexican government wasn’t going to take any action on this. … They’re not very proactive.”</p>
<p>Dousa’s legal team deposed two other CBP officials involved in her case over the summer of 2021. In July, they interviewed Gonzalez Jr., the official who reported suspending the pastor’s trusted traveler status. “In this case I used the wrong word,” he <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21352816-gonzales-nicolas-depo-transcript-redacted">testified</a>. “She was never revoked.” The lawyers deposed Haro the following month. They read him an email he wrote that said, throughout Secure Line, the EOC’s intelligence group&#8217;s job was to “identify any individuals involved in instigating violence within the caravan in addition to collecting intelligence on known instigators.” Haro acknowledged that his responsibilities included selecting individuals who could fit those descriptions for interviews, that there was never evidence that Dousa did, and that he selected her anyway. When asked if it was possible for individuals like Dousa to be cleared by CBP of any suspicion, he testified: “I guess it could be possible. I’m not &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure, though.”</p>
<p>Throughout the deposition and discovery process, Dousa had a limited window into her case. Owing to an agreement between the lawyers on both sides, evidence, such as the blacklist Oliveri sent to Mexico, was temporarily sealed from her view, as were the transcripts of the depositions.</p>
<p>Dousa was permitted to attend the interviews with CBP officials, and she did — “I wanted them to have to face me and see that I’m a real human,” she said — but she was asked to leave the room when subjects deemed sensitive by law enforcement were discussed. Oliveri’s confirmation that he put a target on the pastor’s head for Mexican law enforcement was one of those moments.</p>

<h2>The Report</h2>
<p>While Dousa’s lawyers were gathering testimony from CBP officials last summer, the Department of Homeland Security inspector general’s office was quietly wrapping up its own investigation into Operation Secure Line. On September 21, the results of that investigation were made public.</p>
<p>The inspector general found that while CBP “had legitimate reasons for placing lookouts on U.S. journalists, attorneys, and others suspected of organizing or being associated with the migrant caravan,” many officials were “unaware” of the policies for adding and removing those flags; the policies have not been updated since 1990. The office found that nearly half — 25 of 51 — of the Secure Line lookouts “were on people for whom there was no evidence of direct involvement in illegal activity.”</p>
<p>With CBP offering “little guidance and few restrictions,” the report described one instance in which 15 U.S. citizens were given lookouts for having crossed the border with, or being connected on social media to, an individual whom the agency suspected of plotting violence. “CBP had no information to suggest these 15 individuals might be involved in planning violence or were present at one of the incursions,” the report said. In another case, CBP learned that a suspected caravan organizer had crossed the border in a particular car. “The EOC placed lookouts not only on the owner of that vehicle but also on someone who crossed the border with the vehicle owner one time, 9 months earlier, well before the migrant caravan started traveling towards the United States.”</p>
<p>The inspector general attributed these events less to malice and more to a dangerous mix of unregulated power and incompetence. “We did not find that CBP placed lookouts to retaliate against U.S. citizens for performing lawful work related to the migrant caravan,” the report said. “To the contrary, witnesses told us, and contemporaneous emails and documents corroborated, CBP placed lookouts to gain information about suspected illegal activity and then generally sought information consistent with that purpose during the resulting interviews.”</p>
<p>The report reserved its harshest criticism for the ways CBP officials handled the sensitive private information of U.S. citizens, Dousa included, and documented moments in which those officials either withheld information from, or misled, the inspector general’s investigators. One official — identified as “EOC Official 1,” who was said to have “placed more caravan-related lookouts than anyone else and was in regular contact with the TTRT throughout Operation Secure Line” — told investigators that many of the U.S. citizens who were flagged did not need to be interviewed multiple times. The official said that they personally accessed CBP databases to remove their lookouts. The inspector general accessed those systems to substantiate the claims and found them to be untrue. Presented with this information, the official insisted that they attempted to remove the lookouts and “speculated that a technical glitch may have prevented that from happening.” The report “confirmed that no such glitch occurred.” Instead, investigators found that 18 of the 20 lookouts that the official placed that resulted in secondary inspections were not removed.</p>
<p>In the case of Oliveri, who is not named in the report but is clearly identifiable as “FOB Official 1,” referencing the Foreign Operations Branch, the inspector general focused on the information on U.S. citizens that he shared with Mexican law enforcement. The report noted that “despite the constitutional implications of restricting international travel, CBP has no policies, procedures, guidance, or training that specifically address asking or advising foreign countries to deny entry to Americans.” Still, while CBP may restrict a citizen’s international travel rights in certain circumstances, the agency “could not articulate any genuine basis” for the list Oliveri sent to Mexico and “in fact later admitted that the reasons provided to Mexico were not true.” The report added: “CBP officials at various levels who knew of the request, including the official who oversaw CBP’s entire regional response to the migrant caravan, denied or minimized their involvement and told us the request was neither typical nor appropriate.”</p>
<p>At first, Oliveri, whose assumed truthfulness was the basis for the injunction denial in Dousa’s case, told the inspector general that he never made the request to Mexico. He continued the denial, the report said, until the investigators showed him his own email. According to the report, Oliveri “could not recall anything about most of the 24 individuals, other than he did not think they were involved in illegal activity.” In his email to Mexican law enforcement, Oliveri claimed the U.S. had information indicating that Dousa and the other Americans on the list did not have legal authority to be in Mexico. In his interview with DHS investigators, he admitted that was not true. According to the report, “CBP had ‘no knowledge of whether they did or didn’t have documentation’ when he sent the request.”</p>
<p>Oliveri was not solely responsible for the creation and dissemination of the list. On the contrary, investigators found that he coordinated with at least two officials in the EOC, including one who provided the “target list” that the request was based on. When questioned by investigators, that official “disclaimed involvement with the request” and said Oliveri shouldn’t have sent it, but then “could not explain” why they sent him targets in the first place. In fact, investigators found that the official forwarded Oliveri’s request to their supervisor. The supervisor told investigators that they did not recall seeing the request and “could not explain” why their subordinate sent it. Investigators, however, uncovered “contemporaneous emails” showing that just hours after Oliveri sent the request, the supervisor had asked if a list of U.S. citizens was given to Mexico “to deny them entry into Mexico,” stating that he had spoken to Oliveri about the matter.</p>
<p>In an interview, the supervisor explained that while they could not recall the episode, they probably spoke to Oliveri because they were concerned about what he had done. As the supervisor noted, those rare requests, normally reserved for cases where “an American is wanted by Mexican law enforcement relating to serious concerns,” should be routed through embassies and consulates. The inspector general’s report, however, identified “another possible explanation” for the follow up: that the supervisor ordered the request and was making sure Oliveri carried it out. “If someone was truly concerned about this request, we would expect him to recall asking about the request, express his concern or disapproval in writing, admonish [Oliveri] for sending the request, or take corrective action,” the report said. “We did not find any evidence of such actions.”</p>

<p>Oliveri’s haphazard request to a foreign security service was not an isolated incident. The inspector general identified three CBP officials in the Foreign Operations Branch of the Border Patrol’s San Diego Sector who shared the personal identifying information of U.S. citizens with Mexican authorities on at least eight occasions. What, precisely, these officials asked for is unclear because, as the investigators found, CBP personnel made a habit of sharing information with Mexican officials in large WhatsApp groups, whose members sometimes numbered in the hundreds, and then deleting their messages afterward.</p>
<p>In one case, an FOB official used his work email to send an unencrypted message that included the private information of six U.S. citizens to a Mexican intelligence official’s Yahoo account. The official told investigators that the message was necessary to prevent “a very serious” event from occurring in the future, but their own email showed that was untrue. That same official also admitted sending the document with private information to their own personal Gmail account — “He could not tell us why he did this,” investigators noted — along with images of several caravan associates’ driver’s licenses. Another CBP official, who “repeatedly denied” having shared information about U.S. citizens with Mexico, was shown to have “retroactively attempted to seek approval from his then-supervisor” for having done that very thing. The inspector general’s office identified a fourth CBP official, working outside the FOB in the agency’s Virginia-based National Targeting Center, who entered into an “internal” and “non-binding” agreement with Mexico’s national intelligence office to share information on “organizers, inciters, and supporters of the migrant caravans.” According to the report, the official shared names, photographs, and other personal identifying information of U.S. citizens on at least five occasions.</p>

<p>In none of these cases were the CBP officials in question authorized to do what they were doing. In the San Diego sector, sharing information on U.S. citizens requires three levels of written approval, the inspector general’s report noted. That never happened. The National Targeting Center official, meanwhile, claimed to have received verbal approval from a supervisor, but such approval requires a written request beforehand, and the investigators found no evidence those requests were ever sent. “All four CBP officials who sent information to Mexican officials about Americans told us they communicated with their Mexican counterparts using WhatsApp,” the report said. “None of the four officials retained all their relevant WhatsApp messages.”</p>
<p>This was a serious problem, considering CBP officials’ sudden bouts of apparent amnesia when speaking with congressionally mandated oversight investigators. As the inspector general’s report noted, “the CBP officials’ inability to recall key details about their communications with Mexican officials, or in some cases, whether they even shared information about U.S. citizens with Mexican officials, raises questions about whether there were other instances of Mexican and CBP officials’ sharing information about American caravan associates.”</p>

<h2>The Pastor Fires Back</h2>
<p>By late September, Dousa’s lawyers were deep into drafting a motion for official sanctions in the pastor’s case based on the discrepancies in Oliveri’s statements. They knew the inspector general was investigating Operation Secure Line, but nobody knew when the official conclusions would drop. On the day they planned to file, the report went up online. “It so much confirmed what we had been saying in the lawsuit,” Dousa said. The pastor and her team decided to stop what they were doing and mine the materials for evidence to bolster their case.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[18](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[18] -->“Their whole intelligence structure is really just &#8230; a system of surveillance against people they don’t like.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[18] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[18] -->
<p>The document was a revelation for Dousa on two levels. “It was clear when I read the OIG report that they hadn’t seen the deposition testimony from Saro Oliveri,” she said. “I’d be very curious to see if they update once some of this information comes back to them.” At the same time, Dousa herself had no idea that CBP had requested her detention by Mexican authorities; the documents and testimony surrounding the request had been sealed. It was, for her, the most shocking of the Secure Line revelations of the past three years. “The Trusted Traveler issue was one thing. The idea of being kidnapped by Mexican authorities or others is a whole different thing,” she said. “They were basically asking the federales to get us.”</p>
<p>“We all know that the cartels and other bad actors monitor these communications, especially with the Mexican government, very closely, that they easily could have been warned that I was the high target,” Dousa added. “The idea of the U.S. government asking the Mexican government and its law enforcement to apprehend me, a pastor, is just terrifying.”<strong> </strong></p>
<p>In December, Dousa’s lawyers <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21350359-dousa-sanctions">asked the court to sanction</a> Oliveri for “submitting a false or at best misleading sworn declaration” to the court and “failing to correct the record upon learning” of his faulty declaration. “Pastor Dousa does not file this motion for sanctions lightly,” the request said. The government has yet to respond to the claims. “CBP just doesn’t care,” Dousa said. “They just say what they want, and they get away with it.” That’s the reason for filing the sanctions request, she added, “because I think truth actually is important.”</p>
<p>More than three years after being added to the border blacklist, the pastor is navigating conflicting feelings. On the one hand, she believes her case is stronger than ever. “I don’t feel like I’m screaming into a void anymore,” she said. At the same time, she added, “I also just hate thinking about this. I hate talking about it. It’s a painful memory.” After the NBC story broke in 2019, Dousa’s congregation was inundated with death threats. The church hired private security to protect her. Each fresh round of media coverage prompts a new anxiety. “Anytime a news story comes out, I’m like, ‘Oh no, is that gonna start up again?’” Dousa said. Still, she remains resolute: “I want there to be consequences here. I want there to be disciplinary action taken against these folks.”</p>
<p>CBP, the nation’s largest police agency, is due for a major overhaul, the pastor argued. “Their whole intelligence structure is really just, as you’ve seen, a system of surveillance against people they don’t like,” Dousa said. “They don’t need to have an intelligence division at all. I’ll tell you because I’ve met those intelligence officers. It’s a misnomer.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Mark Brnovich,</u> Arizona’s attorney general and one of several Republicans in the state running for U.S. Senate this year, delivered an urgent message to the governor this month. In <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/arizona-self-defense-opinion.pdf">a legal opinion</a> issued February 7, Brnovich concluded that due to the “unprecedented” policies of President Joe Biden, the state is experiencing an “invasion” in the form of people and drugs across the U.S.-Mexico divide. Arizona is well within its rights to activate the “war powers” of the U.S. Constitution and respond with military force, Brnovich wrote, but it is up to Gov. Doug Ducey to give his troops the green light.</p>
<p>The following day, an <a href="https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/resource/restarting-orderly-process-critical-managing-arrival-asylum-seekers-arizona-border">analysis of the government’s own data</a> by the organization Human Rights First painted a much different picture of the situation in Arizona, revealing that the people who would likely bear the brunt of a state offensive on the southern border are those fleeing violence and instability in some of Latin America’s most tumultuous places.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>The group zeroed in on U.S. Customs and Border Protection data from areas surrounding Yuma, a border community on the western side of the state that has seen large periodic influxes of migrants and asylum-seekers under both the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/17/us/yuma-mayor-emergency-migrants">Trump</a> and <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/04/14/border-patrol-migrants-arizona-ajo-yuma/">Biden</a> administrations. The data showed that most of the people being taken into Border Patrol custody in and around the region are Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan families with small children, virtually all of whom are likely seeking asylum.</p>
<p>The organization argued that the fact that these individuals entered the U.S. immigration system between ports of entry, rather than at ports of entry, is key to understanding dynamics on the border right now. In 2017, according to CBP data, 99 percent of all Cubans and Haitians who encountered U.S. immigration officials on the border did so at a port of entry. In fiscal year 2022, those port encounters dropped to just 3 percent for Haitians and less than 1 percent for Cubans. The reason for the stark reversal, Human Rights First argued, is that successive policies enforced by former President Donald Trump and Biden make applying for asylum at ports next to impossible for most people and make hiring a smuggler the next best option.</p>

<p>In other words, it is not, as Brnovich and other Republicans on the campaign trail argue, the absence of Trump-era policies that is fueling a humanitarian crisis and lining the pockets of organized crime — it is their continuation. “Biden is definitely creating an economic opportunity for cartels, but it’s not because he has open borders,” Julia Neusner, an associate attorney for refugee protection at Human Rights First, told The Intercept. “It’s because the government isn’t doing its job of processing people seeking asylum at ports of entry.”</p>

<p>With the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020, the Trump administration activated a public health order known as Title 42, which authorized Border Patrol agents to summarily expel undocumented migrants — including asylum-seekers — apprehended between ports of entry and all but ended asylum access at the ports. The order built upon other policies instituted under Trump, such as the Migrant Protection Protocols, better known as the &#8220;Remain in Mexico&#8221; program, which similarly forced asylum-seekers back across the border to await an immigration court hearing. Human Rights First and other organizations have <a href="https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/sites/default/files/OneYearBidenAdministrationAssessmentRecommendations.pdf">documented</a> how the offloading of U.S. asylum obligations onto Mexican soil has created an economic boom for smugglers and kidnappers south of the international divide. Despite demands from immigration advocates to lift the order, which Trump’s anti-immigration czar Stephen Miller pushed through <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cdc-officials-objected-to-order-turning-away-migrants-at-border-11601733601">over the objections of career public health professionals</a> at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the administration has kept Title 42 in place. Biden, meanwhile, canceled Remain in Mexico upon entering office, but a federal court ordered the administration to restart the program late last year.</p>
<p>Though crossing the border without authorization is a federal misdemeanor, seeking asylum between ports is a right enshrined under domestic and international law to protect people fleeing danger. Under Title 42, a migrant hoping to seek asylum can go to a port and attempt to make their claim, but they will likely be stopped at the door. (Implementation policies vary from place to place along the border, and exceptions to Title 42 have been made for certain groups of migrants, such as families with small children.) If they hire a smuggler, however, they can at least get onto U.S. soil, where they will have a better chance of beginning a case.</p>

<p>While the lack of asylum access at ports creates an incentive for crossing the border without papers, it also comes with enormous risk. Thanks to a nearly two-decadelong, hypermilitarized war on drugs, northern Mexico’s main corridors for smuggling people and things into the U.S. are controlled by a patchwork of organized criminal networks and abusive government security forces. Robbery, extortion, kidnapping, rape, and murder of migrants navigating this underground economy is commonplace. “People would rather go to ports of entry and request asylum in a way that’s safe and orderly,” Neusner said. “Because that is not an option, the only way for them to access protection is between ports of entry, and that means that they have to rely on cartels and organized criminal groups who control crossings between ports of entry.”</p>
<p>In addition to the precipitous drop in Cubans and Haitians seeking asylum at ports, the CBP data analyzed by Human Rights First also showed steep declines among Nicaraguans and Venezuelans — dropping from 32 and 56 percent, respectively, in fiscal year 2020 to a mere 0.5 and 0.8 percent in fiscal year 2022. As the organization noted, all four countries are currently experiencing major breakdowns in the arenas of human rights, political freedom, and economic stability. In Yuma specifically, CBP data showed that more than half of the people who crossed into the region in December were families with minor children. Service providers on the ground have confirmed that nearly all the migrants crossing the border in the area immediately seek out a Border Patrol agent, Neusner said, a sign that that they are likely planning to apply for asylum.</p>

<p><u>The formal catalyst</u> for Brnovich’s decision to outline a legal pathway to an Arizona border war was <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hoffman-letter.pdf">a request</a> for a legal opinion that Republican state Rep. Jake Hoffman sent in October. Drawing on the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force that began the war on terror and a definition of invasion that he pulled from the Merriam-Webster dictionary, Hoffman described his “firm belief” that the Biden administration, with the “assistance of the Mexican drug cartels,” is overseeing a “coordinated crisis” on the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>Hoffman’s request stemmed from a behind-the-scenes effort spearheaded by Ken Cuccinelli, a former acting deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security under Trump. Cuccinelli is now a fellow at the <a href="https://americarenewing.com/">Center for Renewing America</a>, one of <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/05/29/trump-acolytes-craft-parallel-gop-universe-so-trumpism-lives-on/5253631001/">several right-wing think tanks</a> in Washington, D.C., devoted to continuing the Trump legacy whether or not Trump is in office. As investigative journalist Melissa del Bosque <a href="https://www.theborderchronicle.com/p/the-invasion-script-republicans-launch?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0MDU2ODkwLCJfIjoiZGswZngiLCJpYXQiOjE2NDUzMDg3MzksImV4cCI6MTY0NTMxMjMzOSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTM3MzQzMiIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.C8QvgjZZ_mPs6wDuhMx6c6PHeTv2LdmJBwkotfJ5Jww&amp;utm_source=url">documented last week</a>, Cuccinelli has for more than a decade been pushing the idea that conditions on the border qualify as an invasion and that border states have the authority to respond to that invasion with military force. Cuccinelli told former White House adviser Steve Bannon in an interview last month that he has spent the past two years working to convince Ducey, as well as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, of his idea.</p>
<p>Declaring a state of emergency last year, Abbott, who is also running for reelection, has embraced Cuccinelli’s argument through “Operation Lone Star,” a massive, combined effort of 10,000 state troopers and Texas National Guard soldiers that circumvents the federal immigration system by arresting undocumented migrants on state-level criminal trespassing charges. Last month, in a case involving an Ecuadorian asylum-seeker, a Texas judge <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/01/26/texas-greg-abbott-operation-lone-star/">ruled that the operation was unconstitutional</a>. Hundreds of similar claims have been filed in the state since, with defense attorneys documenting cases of migrants lingering in Texas jails for weeks or months at a time without access to a lawyer. Journalists at the state and national levels have meanwhile documented repeated <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/02/02/texas-greg-abbott-operation-lone-star-national-guard/">evidence of major problems</a> surrounding the troops deployed for the mission — from drug and alcohol use to run-ins with local enforcement agents to missing pay and a rash of solider suicides.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[5](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A2%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="2"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[5] -->
<p>In his analysis, Brnovich wrote that Arizona&#8217;s right to protect against an invasion applies to criminal groups in Mexico, which he blames for importing drugs and violence into the U.S., and that Ducey has the constitutional authority to call up the Arizona National Guard to fend off their purported invasion. “The State Self-Defense Clause of the Constitution establishes that States in our federal system retain the sovereign power to ‘engage in War’ when ‘actually invaded,’ and States do not require the ‘Consent of Congress’ to do so,” he wrote. “Arizona therefore has the power to defend itself from this invasion under the Governor’s authority as Commander-in-Chief. An actual invasion permits the State to engage in defensive actions within its own territory at or near its border.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Ducey has deployed National Guard troops to the border in limited numbers, the governor has yet to mobilize a force on par with his counterpart in Texas. When asked about Brnovich’s legal opinion earlier this month, the governor <a href="https://www.12news.com/article/news/local/arizona/ag-brnovich-opinion-gives-ducey-green-light-to-engage-in-war-at-border-experts-say-ag-got-it-wrong/75-10f61896-5b35-405e-a62e-f0078d76c196">dodged the question</a>. David Bier, an immigration policy expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, <a href="https://www.12news.com/article/news/local/arizona/ag-brnovich-opinion-gives-ducey-green-light-to-engage-in-war-at-border-experts-say-ag-got-it-wrong/75-10f61896-5b35-405e-a62e-f0078d76c196">told</a> an NBC affiliate in Phoenix that the legal opinion would be “laughed out of any court” if Arizona officials actually attempted to follow through with the plan. Robert Robb, a conservative columnist at the Arizona Republic, meanwhile, described Brnovich’s legal opinion as “<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/robertrobb/2022/02/09/mark-brnovich-border-security-invasion-opinion-sloppy-misleading/6705821001/">stunningly sloppy</a>” and argued that the attorney general was blurring the lines between his duties as a public official and his electoral ambitions.</p>
<p>In an interview with CNN last month, Miller made clear that he and his cohort of loyal Trumpists are set on projecting <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/14/politics/immigration-midterm-election/index.html">a narrative of border chaos</a> heading into this year’s midterm elections. That narrative and the policy moves that follow with it have real consequences for people on the ground, Neusner argued. “We’ve seen so many campaign ads of candidates running for election or reelection that use this really fearmongering rhetoric about invasions to advance their own political agenda,” she said. “It’s definitely worse because this is an election year.” Brnovich’s claim that Arizona is being invaded, she added, is “ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“DHS’s own data shows it’s very likely that the vast majority of people arriving at that border are people seeking protection,” Neusner said. “It’s a dangerous decision because we’ve already seen in Texas how problematic it can be when states authorize local law enforcement to enforce federal immigration laws.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>One had a</u> promising, potentially life-changing job interview coming up at a call center. The other had a wheelchair-using loved one at home who required daily care. Both were soldiers in the Texas Army National Guard, requesting leave from Gov. Greg Abbott’s Operation Lone Star, a controversial election-year deployment of 10,000 soldiers to the southern border. Both of their hardship requests were denied, and both men died by suicide while deployed on the border mission late last year.</p>
<p>When asked last month about the deaths of soldiers like <a href="https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2021/12/23/wave-of-suicides-hits-texas-national-guards-border-mission/">Pfc. Joshua Cortez</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/19/us/texas-national-guard-greg-abbott.html">Sgt. John Crutcher</a> — two of the four deaths by suicide linked to Operation Lone Star in recent months — Abbott said his critics were “<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/01/11/texas-greg-abbott-national-guard/">just playing politics</a>” and that the focus should be on <a href="https://www.dspo.mil/Portals/113/Documents/TAB%20A_20210929_OFR_Rpt_Q2%20CY%202021%20QSR.pdf?ver=7vDYCTnjJlZPN_qKR5pU9Q%3D%3D">military suicides</a> under President Joe Biden.</p>

<p>For Jason Featherston, who joined the Guard straight out of high school and spent the next two decades rising to the upper ranks of the Texas Military Department, the governor’s comments were not only insulting, they were wrong. The focus, Featherston argues, is exactly where it needs to be. As the highest-ranking enlisted officer in the Texas National Guard, Featherston had a front row seat to the creation and implementation of Operation Lone Star before retiring in November. He has since become an outspoken critic of Abbott’s operation, which he describes as a “rush to failure” that is taking an unconscionable toll on soldiers and their families.</p>
<p>“I expect my 9- and 10-year-old kids to deflect blame to the other. I don&#8217;t expect a governor, who is the commander in chief of the Texas military, to deflect blame to a president,” Featherston told The Intercept. “I voted for Abbott in the last election, but he will never get another vote of mine.”</p>
<p>Concerns surrounding the deployment of National Guard soldiers have grown exponentially since early December, as a string of investigative news reports from <a href="https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2021/12/08/death-drugs-and-a-disbanded-unit-how-the-guards-mexico-border-mission-fell-apart/">Army Times</a>, the <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/01/07/texas-border-national-guard-pay-suicides/">Texas Tribune</a>, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/01/21/texas-national-guard-mission-on-border-plauged-by-complaints-suicides/6596952001/?gnt-cfr=1">USA Today</a>, and others have documented arrests of soldiers assigned to the border mission, patterns of DUIs, alcohol and drug use, missing pay, and soldiers losing money that they could be making in their civilian lives.</p>

<p>Just this week, a joint <a href="https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2022/02/01/haste-and-planning-failures-doomed-operation-lone-stars-troops-to-suffer/">Army Times-Texas Tribune investigation</a> detailed the chaotic and disastrously hasty way that Operation Lone Star was cobbled together. Abbott’s rush to put troops on the ground threw volunteer soldiers accustomed to missions with clear end dates and plenty of lead time for preparation into an obligatory mission with no end in sight and little to no time to put their lives in order prior to deployment. The report found that 1 in 5 troops in the 6,500-strong “operational force” of Operation Lone Star “reported problems with their pay, including being paid late, too little or not at all for months” and “living in cramped trailers with dozens of troops.” The Texas Military Department disputed the reporting, which was based on internal documents and interviews with nearly 40 current and former guard soldiers.</p>
<p>“If you’re going to send soldiers to the border, you need to pay them,” Featherston said. “You need to give them the right equipment. If they have hardships, those things need to be considered, because life gets a vote in anything that we do. There were hardship packets that were denied that should have been approved, and unfortunately, if it wasn&#8217;t for Operation Lone Star, there&#8217;d be another four families that would have loved ones still here with us.”</p>
<p>Launched in March and expanded from 500 to 10,000 troops in under a year, Operation Lone Star is among the largest deployments of soldiers in the 186-year history of the Texas Military Department. The mission is funded by state taxpayers as part of a $3 billion border security package that the Texas Legislature approved last summer.</p>

<p>At first, Featherston thought that the governor’s plans seemed consistent with past border missions he had participated in. That started to change in September, when the nation’s attention turned to thousands of <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/09/20/border-patrol-texas-del-rio/">Haitian asylum-seekers gathered under a bridge in Del Rio</a>, in West Texas, and Fox News host <a href="https://texasscorecard.com/state/tucker-carlson-calls-out-gov-greg-abbott-for-inaction-on-southern-border/">Tucker Carlson began calling Abbott out</a> for failing to lock down the border. “This country is being invaded,” Carlson said at the time.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/19/us/texas-national-guard-greg-abbott.html">state records</a>, Abbott requested 2,500 troops — in addition to the 1,500 troops he had already called up for Operation Lone Star — following Carlson’s public criticism. Soon after, the governor announced that 6,500 soldiers and troopers were participating in the border mission. By November, that number had <a href="https://www.borderreport.com/hot-topics/immigration/10000-national-guard-and-texas-state-troopers-deployed-to-border-for-operation-lone-star/">mushroomed to 10,000</a>. “Putting 500 people or 1,000 down there, it&#8217;s not a big thing. We&#8217;ve been doing that for years,” Featherston said, referring to previous iterations of Texas border operations. “Putting 10,000 people on the border is not even sustainable.” He added: “That’s when the talk really kind of started of, ‘Hey, yeah, this is just a political stunt.’”</p>
<p>The sentiment was widespread, Featherston said, and ran from units on the ground to the upper ranks of the Texas Military Department. Since the expansion took off, Featherston’s phone hasn’t stopped ringing. Every day, he said, he receives calls from soldiers on the border mission who are navigating one unnecessary difficulty or another.</p>
<p>More than 150 hardship requests from Texas National Guard soldiers on the border mission reviewed by The Intercept revealed the wide range of ways that Operation Lone Star has disrupted soldiers’ lives, from a recently single mother trying to raise two kids in the middle of pandemic, to a lab technician trying to keep her rural Texas hospital’s Covid-19 testing running, to a small town police chief imploring the Texas Military Department not to take one of his few remaining officers away. All of those requests and scores of others like them were denied to fulfill Abbott’s demand for boots on the ground.</p>
<p>In a statement to USA Today late last month, Col. Rita Holton, a spokesperson for the Texas Military Department, said Guard officials have granted around 75 percent of the more than 900 hardship requests received by the department and that 75 percent of pay discrepancies for troops in Operation Lone Star had been resolved. Holton added that field commanders were working to resolve issues associated with soldiers’ living conditions.</p>
<p>“Soldiers deserve better than what they’re getting,” Featherston said. “Guardsmen are the people you run into at the grocery store in your local community. They have families. They have lives. They do everything that every other normal person does, except for they leave home to go help someone or have to deploy overseas.”</p>

<p><u>Abbott’s protestations aside</u>, there is no question that the governor’s border operation is steeped in politics.</p>
<p>For much of the last year, conservative and rural counties in West Texas, particularly Val Verde and Kinney, have seen a considerable rise in undocumented border crossings on the vast private ranches that blanket the region. At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmFr3BBVvfU">a rally</a> in Kinney County in May, speakers aired a range of concerns about the issue, from ranchers worried about undocumented men wandering onto their properties while their wives and children were home alone, to baseless rumors of Hondurans engaged in organ trafficking, to Goliad County Sheriff Roy Boyd warning that a “Marxist invasion” was underway.</p>

<p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s general counsel, Austin Kinghorn, was on hand for the event and assured the audience that the state was mobilizing a response. “You are not alone. General Paxton is going to fight like hell for you,” he said. “This is our top priority.”</p>
<p>The following week, Abbott issued a formal <a href="https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-issues-disaster-declaration-in-response-to-border-crisis-in-texas">declaration</a> of disaster on the border and ordered the Texas Department of Public Safety to begin arresting migrants on state offenses — overwhelmingly trespassing charges made possible by private landowners who agreed to allow DPS to conduct operations on their property — and transferring them to state jails.</p>
<p>In July, Abbott <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/07/27/greg-abbott-texas-national-guard-migrants/">ordered the Texas National Guard</a> to begin providing support to the Operation Lone Star state troopers. In an email to The Intercept last week, DPS said that since the operation began, state troopers have made more than 10,400 criminal arrests, including 2,572 arrests for criminal trespassing. “There have also been 8,287 felony charges filed,” the agency said. Additionally, DPS reported that state troopers had “made more than 87,800 migrant apprehensions and referrals.” DPS did not respond when asked how it distinguishes Lone Star arrests from other arrests. The Texas National Guard said in email that Guard soldiers had “apprehended or referred more than 100,000 illegal migrants to partner law enforcement agencies” but similarly did not respond to questions about when those apprehensions and referrals took place and whether they were part of Operation Lone Star alone or included other border missions.</p>
<p>Under Operation Lone Star, the majority of the state’s cases <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/texas-jails-fill-with-migrants-as-border-arrests-overwhelm-courts-11636376402">have been dismissed</a>. The flood of low-level prosecutions has thoroughly overwhelmed the rural and resource-strapped counties where most of the operation’s arrests are taking place. Hundreds of undocumented immigrants have languished in Texas state jail cells for days, weeks, and even months on end, in some cases without access to a lawyer and in others after their bail has been paid. Attorneys who have represented immigrants arrested under the program have <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/24/us/texas-migrant-trespass-detentions/index.html?fbclid=IwAR3xN43jw3uKZP5ZWpz93x31HFNcamnlXPkvaRKBTqZBFDguprch3iO1zV0">documented state law enforcement luring individuals onto private property</a> and then arresting them for trespassing.</p>
<p>Last month a state judge in Travis County, home to the Texas capital, Austin, <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2022/01/26/texas-greg-abbott-operation-lone-star/">ruled in favor</a> of an Ecuadorian man who argued that his treatment in Operation Lone Star constituted a violation of his rights under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, which holds that the federal government, not the states, is responsible for enforcing the nation’s immigration laws. Less than 24 hours later, Texas RioGrande Legal Aid <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21183525-trla-writ-of-habeas-corpus-1-14-22-final">filed a writ</a> before the same court on behalf of <a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2022/01/20/operation-lone-star-tx-400-arrests-challeneged-travis-county/6586179001/">more than 400 clients</a> making a similar claim. These challenges follow similar concerns raised by <a href="https://www.aclutx.org/en/cases/texas-migrant-arrest-program-under-operation-lone-star">civil rights organizations</a> and <a href="https://castro.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-castro-urges-department-of-justice-to-investigate-governor-abbotts-operation-lone-star">Democratic lawmakers</a>, who called for a federal investigation into Abbott&#8217;s operation late last year.</p>
<p>By putting Operation Lone Star at the center of his argument for reelection, Abbott’s border messaging reflects a broader effort led by Stephen Miller, a former senior adviser to President Donald Trump, to deploy a narrative of chaos going into the midterm elections. “I’m very open about the fact that I believe the Republican Party needs to really dig in starting now, and work and put in the work to elevate this issue to the center of our national dialogue,” Miller <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/14/politics/immigration-midterm-election/index.html">told</a><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/14/politics/immigration-midterm-election/index.html"> CNN</a> last month. Miller, who as a congressional aide <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/stephen-miller-breitbart-emails">circulated white nationalist literature</a> for immigration talking points, used the same strategy in Trump’s run for the White House in 2015 and 2016, <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/12/27/border-patrol-trump-biden-politics/">linking the would-be president up with the National Border Patrol Council</a>, the Border Patrol’s union. In 2016, the NBPC, a member of the much-larger AFL-CIO federation of unions, made its first-ever presidential endorsement, backing Trump after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/28/us/border-patrol-agents-trump-green-line-podcast.html">he</a> and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/breitbart/breitbart-news-daily-brandon-darby-stephen-miller-march-23-2016">Miller</a> separately went on the union’s Breitbart-sponsored podcast, and after Trump made a visit to agents in South Texas and met with union officials.</p>
<p>Abbott has clearly embraced the Trump model heading into 2022. In <a href="https://twitter.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1463277120315138054">a video</a> released announcing his run for reelection in November, the first two items Abbott listed on his agenda were border security and showing support for police. To kick off his campaign, the governor traveled to the Rio Grande Valley, where he <a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/texas-politics/gov-abbott-to-meet-with-border-officials-make-announcement-in-the-rgv/">held a press conference</a> at the Border Patrol union’s headquarters.</p>
<p>At the event, Abbott touted the “unprecedented” $3 billion that he has funneled into “border security,” the 15 laws he passed to crack down on human trafficking, and the progress Texas is making on building a wall along the U.S-Mexico divide. Thanks to Biden’s “open border” policies, he said, agents were doing their jobs with “one hand tied behind their back.” The governor added that if any agents happened to lose their jobs for failing to comply with a vaccine mandate, he would hire them to continue their work for the state of Texas.</p>
<p>The message was tailor-made for the Border Patrol union’s right-wing politics. Brandon Judd, the president of the NBPC, announced at the event last month that Abbott, like Trump, had the council’s official backing. “He’s doing what the federal government refuses to do, and for that we’re extremely grateful,” Judd said. Without the governor’s efforts, he added, “thousands of more people undoubtedly would be dead today.” Though Judd, a frequent Fox News contributor, offered no evidence to support the extraordinary claim, Abbott expressed his appreciation all the same.</p>
<p>“To have the support of the men and women who are at the tip of the spear of securing our border means everything to me and my campaign,” the governor said. Within hours, Abbott shared a <a href="https://twitter.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1480635564722475013">pre-produced video</a> of Judd explaining the endorsement.</p>

<p>The Republicans’ border strategy goes beyond Texas. In Arizona, state Attorney General Mark Brnovich is also in election mode, and he too takes a Miller-esque view of the border. Running for U.S. Senate against Democrat Mark Kelly, Brnovich has argued in court that Biden’s immigration policies are in fact “<a href="https://tucson.com/news/local/subscriber/feds-arizona-cant-sue-over-halt-to-border-wall-construction/article_bddcd8fe-17f6-11ec-8999-0f3c0d957907.html">population augmentation programs</a>.” Like Abbott in Texas, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey has also <a href="https://azgovernor.gov/governor/news/2022/01/governor-ducey-and-arizona-county-sheriffs-agree-efforts-secure-border">embraced high-profile deployments</a> of the state Department of Public Safety and National Guard to the border. Ducey’s Republican colleagues have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-joe-biden-phoenix-doug-ducey-constitutions-a8e57c51e7bc2bc1dabca98fe8dcb309">urged the governor</a> to go even further and use an unconventional interpretation of the war powers of the U.S. Constitution to declare that Arizona is under “invasion,” thus allowing for a wide-ranging state-led military response.</p>
<p>In Texas, Abbott’s Operation Lone Star is the latest in a long line of Republican governors attempting to use a combination of the National Guard and state law enforcement as de facto immigration agents, said Timothy Dunn, a professor of sociology at Salisbury University who has researched and written extensively on the militarization of the U.S.-Mexico divide.</p>
<p>“This is part of the really rather lengthy history of Texas moving into border enforcement in a big way,” Dunn told The Intercept. “Over the years it’s kept getting bigger and bigger.”</p>
<p>Among the qualities that set Lone Star apart from its predecessors is the fact that because it is a state-funded operation, National Guard soldiers theoretically could make an arrest of a migrant as part of the mission. Exactly how many of those arrests — as opposed to apprehensions or referrals, in which a soldier hands a migrant off to another agency — are actually happening is unclear; the Texas National Guard did not respond when asked that question. Army Times and the Texas Tribune reported this week that at least one specialized unit of two dozen soldiers who work as police officers in their civilian lives are making arrests in Kinney County. “I’ve yet to meet a soldier that&#8217;s actually making an arrest,” Featherston said. Instead, he said, the vast majority of troops spend hours on end every day staring out into the expanse of the Texas borderlands.</p>

<p>Exercised or not, the authority is “historically unusual,” Dunn said. “That takes militarization to a whole new level.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dunn cautions against letting the hardships endured by National Guard soldiers deployed to Operation Lone Star, important as they are, overshadow the dubious parallel legal system that the entire mission rests upon. “Don’t forget about all the immigrants, too, who are being held without charge or who are having their constitutional rights just absolutely taken away,” he said. “The Constitution applies to everybody in the U.S. It doesn’t just apply to citizens.”</p>
<p>The combination of a mass constitutional threat and the billions of dollars being spent to support it are, for Dunn, the most galling facets of Abbott’s operation. “Just think what we could do with those resources other than spending on this performative bullshit that really has very little impact,” he said. A more humane, dignified, and functional system could be built, Dunn argued. “It wouldn&#8217;t take a huge amount of money, and certainly something like $3 billion would go a hell of a long way in the state of Texas towards doing that — and yet that&#8217;s not going to win you enough votes.”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s just a tremendous waste of resources, and it’s not really going to have much of an effect except to boost somebody&#8217;s political campaign,” Dunn said. “At least they hope it will.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Texas Gov. Greg</u> Abbott’s crusade on the southern border is under fire. Earlier this month, a state judge ruled in favor of an undocumented Ecuadorian man who alleged that his treatment in the governor’s militarized Operation Lone Star campaign was the product of a constitutional train wreck that is upending the relationship between the federal government and the state. With backing from the county district attorney in Austin, the decision opened the door to similar challenges, which began coming in less than 24 hours later and now threaten the continued existence of the controversial policing experiment at the heart of Abbott’s bid for reelection.</p>
<p>For nearly a year, a patchwork of state police troopers, members of the Texas National Guard, and local law enforcement agencies operating under Abbott’s orders have delivered thousands of undocumented men arrested on state trespassing charges into a shadow legal system rife with problems, lawyers for Jesus Alberto Guzman Curipoma argued in a January 13 hearing before District Judge Jan Soifer. Despite being housed within the Texas criminal justice apparatus, Abbott’s operation is expressly designed to prosecute migrants and migrants alone, the defense attorneys told the Travis County judge, thus undermining bedrock constitutional principles that delegate immigration enforcement to the federal government.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21183523-ols-county-ag-guzman-curipoma_writ_2022_01_12_stanswer">a filing ahead</a> of the hearing, Travis County District Attorney José Garza told the court that he agreed with Guzman’s constitutional claims and that his office would not put on a defense for the state in the case. “After careful consideration, the State agrees that Applicant’s prosecution for criminal trespass as part of Operation Lone Star violates the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution and represents an impermissible attempt to intrude on federal immigration policy,” Garza said. A private attorney contracted by Kinney County, where Guzman was arrested, argued that Soifer did not have jurisdiction over the case and told the court that he received a text message during the hearing from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office urging him to halt the proceedings.</p>
<p>Both efforts failed to convince Soifer, who became the first Texas judge to rule that the governor’s program is unconstitutional. The ruling set off a flurry of legal filings throughout the state, marking what could be the beginning of a major legal battle in the weeks ahead. The following day, January 14, Texas RioGrande Legal Aid <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21183525-trla-writ-of-habeas-corpus-1-14-22-final">filed a writ</a> before the Travis County Court on behalf of <a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/2022/01/20/operation-lone-star-tx-400-arrests-challeneged-travis-county/6586179001/">more than 400 clients</a> claiming violations of their constitutional rights as a result of Operation Lone Star. By January 17, Brent Smith, the attorney for Kinney County, had appealed Soifer’s ruling, informing the court that he would seek a trial in the case. Garza’s office filed a motion to dismiss the appeal the following day.</p>

<p>An engineer with no criminal record currently seeking asylum in the U.S., Guzman was arrested in a Kinney County rail yard in rural West Texas on September 17. His nearly five-hour hearing was conducted virtually. When the judge finally rendered her decision, he pressed his palms together in a gesture of grateful prayer.</p>
<p>Guzman was jailed for nearly a month as result of Operation Lone Star, much of that time after his family had posted bail, and remained under court supervision heading into the hearing. Paxton, too, vowed to appeal the ruling in Guzman’s case, though so far that has not happened. In <a href="https://twitter.com/KenPaxtonTX/status/1481989343405391876">a tweet</a>, the state attorney general framed the judge’s ruling in political terms, casting Garza as an operator dispatched by billionaire George Soros and Soifer as his liberal enabler; the judge previously served as chair of the Travis County Democratic Party, and the district attorney was elected in the wake of the George Floyd protests with <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/12/17/travis-county-district-attorney-austin-police/">vows to rein in police abuses</a>.</p>
<p>Guzman’s attorneys contend that because the attorney general failed to intervene in the case while it was being litigated, he has no legal standing to appeal. The lawyers, Angelica Cogliano and Addy Miró, have spent the past seven months representing clients swept up in Abbott’s border blitz. In joint interviews, the defense attorneys said that while the Travis County District Attorney’s Office deserves credit for refusing to defend the governor’s operation, that credit should be tempered by the facts.</p>
<p>“I know everybody’s trying to turn this into political theater, but on its face this is a horrific program, and their duty is to do the right thing,” Cogliano told The Intercept. “It’s impressive, but it’s also right.”</p>

<p><u>Abbott launched Operation</u> Lone Star <a href="https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-dps-launch-operation-lone-star-to-address-crisis-at-southern-border">in March</a>. Since then, the governor, citing a state-level <a href="https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-issues-disaster-declaration-in-response-to-border-crisis-in-texas">disaster declaration</a>, has drastically ramped up the program to include <a href="https://www.borderreport.com/hot-topics/immigration/10000-national-guard-and-texas-state-troopers-deployed-to-border-for-operation-lone-star/">10,000</a> state troopers in the Texas Department of Public Safety and members of the Texas National Guard.</p>
<p>From his announcement of his candidacy through the kickoff of his reelection campaign earlier this month, Abbott has put the border at the center of his messaging, arguing that the federal government has lost control of the U.S.-Mexico divide under President Joe Biden and that Texas has been forced to respond. Bolstered by $3 billion in border security spending that the Texas Legislature approved last year, Lone Star is the operational centerpiece of that effort.</p>

<p>DPS Director Steven McCraw said at an event in Austin last week that under the governor’s program, his troopers have <a href="https://www.thecentersquare.com/texas/nine-months-into-operation-lone-star-texas-dps-reports-record-interdiction-numbers/article_38b29292-7a14-11ec-a1d9-1f826d0f9ae8.html">arrested more than 10,000 undocumented immigrants</a> in the past nine months. Whether those arrests are doing anything to achieve Operation Lone Star’s stated objective is up for debate. In November, the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/texas-jails-fill-with-migrants-as-border-arrests-overwhelm-courts-11636376402">reported</a> that just 3 percent of the roughly 1,500 individuals arrested in the operation by that point had actually been convicted and that of 170 cases that were resolved, roughly 70 percent “were dismissed, declined or otherwise dropped, in some instances for lack of evidence.” In fact, in some cases, lawyers noted that a client’s processing through Operation Lone Star gave them an opportunity to stay in the country and pursue their asylum claim on U.S. soil, whereas the Trump-era mandatory federal expulsion programs that the Biden administration continues to enforce would not.</p>
<p>Legal concerns over the implementation of Operation Lone Star have exploded in recent months. In September, a network of Texas defense attorneys <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/09/27/texas-border-migrants-jail/">discovered</a> a major constitutional failing of the program: Hundreds of men — Operation Lone Star exclusively targets men — arrested as a result of the governor’s program were being held on state-level criminal trespassing charges without access to counsel. Cogliano and Miró were among that group of attorneys. At one point, their office phone number was circulated inside the Briscoe Unit, a state prison in South Texas that <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/07/08/texas-immigration-prison-empty/">Abbott cleared out</a> for Operation Lone Star prisoners. The pair estimated that they received more than 300 calls in a matter of two hours. Within a week, that number soared into the thousands.</p>
<p>The voices on the other end of the line repeatedly described having paid their bond only to remain in jail for days, weeks, even months. “Everybody started calling our office,” Miró said. Guzman was among those callers, reaching out in early October, more than two weeks after his family posted cash bail in his case. Like others prosecuted under Operation Lone Star, Guzman was apprehended by DPS troopers, charged with misdemeanor trespassing under state law, and transferred to state custody; this stands in contrast with the federal charges, processing, and detention that would normally result from an undocumented migrant’s encounter with a Border Patrol agent.</p>
<p>As the lawyers dug deeper into Guzman’s case and others like it, what they found shocked them. The rural counties where Operation Lone Star arrests were taking place were at best incapable — and in some cases seemingly unwilling — of providing the bare minimums of due process in response to the deluge of low-level cases brought on by the governor’s campaign. “They are completely backlogged,” Miró said. Obtaining basic public documents like a probable cause affidavit proved virtually impossible. The men in custody were routinely presented with plea deals, written in English and without translation, and encouraged to sign. Hearings were sometimes held en masse, outdoors, in a parking lot.</p>
<p>The defense attorneys also observed a pattern, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/24/us/texas-migrant-trespass-detentions/index.html?fbclid=IwAR3xN43jw3uKZP5ZWpz93x31HFNcamnlXPkvaRKBTqZBFDguprch3iO1zV0">later corroborated by video evidence</a>, of DPS troopers leading individuals onto private property and then arresting them for trespassing.</p>
<p>“Even as criminal defense attorneys that deal with the criminal justice system every day, this boggled our minds,” Cogliano said of the scope of the constitutional and civil rights violations embodied in Operation Lone Star. “We’ve never had a client pay cash bail anywhere in the state or country that was charged with any kind of crime that didn&#8217;t get out of jail when he posted the cash bail, or where we got pushback about letting him out of jail when he paid cash bail.”</p>

<p>Guzman’s lawyers were particularly alarmed by what happened after his family posted bond on September 20. Typically, if state or local authorities take an undocumented person into custody on the border and the federal government wants to begin deportation proceedings against them, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will place what’s known as a “detainer” on the individual. Federal deportation officers will then have 48 hours to retrieve that person. In Guzman’s case, a detainer did not appear until after that window had closed and his bond had been paid. What’s more, according to <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21187324-exhibit-j-coe-affidavit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an affidavit</a> Kinney County Sheriff Brad Coe submitted in July, ICE informed his office that even when detainers were issued, the agency would not be picking up individuals arrested on trespassing charges alone.</p>
<p>“They needed to let him go,” Miró said. Guzman remained in state custody until October 10, when he was driven to an ICE facility in San Antonio. In early November, after being transferred to the South Texas Detention Complex, a for-profit immigration jail, Guzman was granted bond in his immigration case. Who exactly facilitated the initial drive that delivered Guzman from state to federal custody, which Miró and Cogliano argue was a clear violation of Texas law, remains unclear. “We tried to find this out,” Cogliano said. “Nobody will admit it.”</p>
<p>Though he was out of jail, Guzman remained under court supervision with an open case. He wanted to fight the charges, so the two attorneys sought a trial in Kinney County in late December. “Everybody looked at us weird — like, ‘What?’” Miró said. Prior to Operation Lone Star, Kinney County hadn’t held a trial in seven years. “Nobody knew what to do with us,” Miró said. The lawyers decided to take the case elsewhere.</p>
<p>Cogliano noted that under Texas law, habeas corpus claims — in which an individual calls upon the government to justify its continued deprivation of their liberty before a judge — can be heard anywhere in the state, not just the jurisdiction where the arrest in question took place, and so the pair filed Guzman’s claim in Travis County, home to the state capital, Austin. “Everyone’s been saying we were creative, and it’s not. It’s just allowed,” Cogliano said. “It’s not like we twisted anything. It’s black-letter law.”</p>
<p>While defense attorneys in Texas have challenged Abbott’s program in the courts, Democrats in Congress have called for a federal response to the governor’s operation.</p>
<p>In October, <a href="https://castro.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-castro-urges-department-of-justice-to-investigate-governor-abbotts-operation-lone-star">Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro and more than two dozen Democratic lawmakers</a> sent a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Attorney General Merrick Garland demanding an investigation into Operation Lone Star and arguing, like the lawyers in Guzman’s case, that the governor’s campaign likely violated the supremacy clause of the Constitution.</p>
<p>Last month, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Texas Civil Rights Project, and the Texas Fair Defense Project, with support from more than 100 legal organizations, echoed that demand <a href="https://www.aclutx.org/en/cases/texas-migrant-arrest-program-under-operation-lone-star">in a complaint</a> to the Justice Department that described Operation Lone Star as “riddled with civil rights violations.”</p>
<p>The advocacy groups added that in Kinney County, local officials have <a href="https://cokinneytx.civicweb.net/document/17977/Letter%20of%20Intent%20to%20Contract%20Garrison%20Trading.pdf?handle=F497D8AC0D1B401A867AB73F2B36E1F0">explored hiring private contractors</a> with experience in Iraq and Afghanistan to bolster Operation Lone Star and encouraged armed militias to join in the effort. “By fostering governmental relationships with armed vigilante groups that seek to target migrants, Kinney County leadership is discriminating against migrants,” the groups wrote. “These efforts increase the chances of violence against Black and Brown individuals in Kinney County. If effectuated, they will continue to lead to unlawful and discriminatory actions on the basis of race and national origin by vigilante groups functioning as state actors.”</p>
<p>A parallel federal deployment of National Guard members to the Texas border, separate from Operation Lone Star, has also drawn extensive concern in recent weeks following an <a href="https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2021/12/08/death-drugs-and-a-disbanded-unit-how-the-guards-mexico-border-mission-fell-apart/">Army Times investigation</a> that revealed widespread problems involving troops assigned to the mission, including arrests, rampant drug and alcohol abuse, DUIs, and a pattern of mysterious deaths and suicides. In a subcommittee hearing in Washington last week, Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat who represents El Paso, which is home to the Fort Bliss Army base, <a class="c-link" href="https://twitter.com/RepEscobar/status/1484231601227710464" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">described</a> the reports as “shocking” and “deeply alarming.”</p>

<p><u>For Eric Gamino</u>, an assistant professor of criminology and justice studies at California State University, Northridge, Operation Lone Star is following a familiar script.</p>
<p>Nine years ago, Gamino was a police officer participating in then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s Operation Strong Safety, another deployment of state and local police to deter migrants from crossing the border, while at the same time finishing a dissertation on race, policing, and immigration in South Texas. As part of his doctoral research, Gamino’s supervisors agreed to allow him to document his job and interview his colleagues so long as he used pseudonyms for his subjects (a common practice in academic social research). Conducted from 2012 through 2015, a span that included the beginning of the ongoing influx of unaccompanied Central American children into the Rio Grande Valley, Gamino’s interviews and firsthand experience became the basis of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0160597621991544">a paper that was published in March</a> of last year and a forthcoming book.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[6](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[6] -->“You look at the terminology that’s utilized; it’s this narrative that there’s this onslaught.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[6] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[6] -->
<p>A lifelong resident of South Texas with more than decade of experience on patrol, Gamino’s work traces the long history of politicized policing deployments to his region of the country, from <a href="https://sgaus.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/TEXAS.pdf">Operation Border Star</a> to <a href="https://www.dps.texas.gov/sites/default/files/documents/publicinformation/drawbrdgphotos.pdf">Operation Drawbridge</a> to <a href="https://www.govtech.com/archive/texas-governor-perry-provides-additional-38.html">Operation Linebacker</a> to <a href="https://www.dps.texas.gov/sites/default/files/documents/publicinformation/documents/operationstrongsafetyrpt20150201.pdf">Operation Strong Safety</a>. “You look at the terminology that’s utilized; it’s this narrative that there’s this onslaught,” Gamino told The Intercept. This narrative is the basis for a performance of border theater that in Gamino’s experience plays out on two stages: The first, where politicians like Abbott perform, is public facing. The second, where Gamino spent his time as a participant and observer in Operation Strong Safety, is not.</p>
<p>Within this backstage setting, Gamino found a widespread view among his fellow officers that an operation pitched as a massive, critical quasi-military campaign to secure the border was fundamentally just another avenue for overtime, one that entailed sitting in a patrol car parked along the Rio Grande for hours on end, doing nothing. In his paper, Gamino describes a pre-shift roll call in which his supervisor acknowledged that officers had taken to calling the detail “Operation Netflix,” on account of all the streaming they were doing. The supervisor warned the officers not to fall asleep on the job because there were politicians in town, which meant that there were media in town as well. “Last thing you want them to do is catch you asleep while working Operation Strong Safety,” he said. According to Gamino’s account, the warning did little to stop the streaming and sleeping underway.</p>
<p>When officers did encounter undocumented migrants in Operation Strong Safety, Gamino writes, they had a choice: call Border Patrol or don’t. Some would. Some wouldn’t. The “overwhelming majority” of migrants Gamino encountered were Central Americans, mostly mothers and kids, fleeing a myriad of factors. “Violence, poverty, political instability, all these things,” he said. “All they wanted was just a chance to apply or seek asylum here in the U.S.”</p>
<p>What sets Operation Lone Star apart from its historical antecedents is the fact that the discretion Gamino had as an officer is now gone. State and local law enforcement officers are now making arrests themselves, and the arrestees are being funneled into the Texas criminal justice system. “With Lone Star, they upped the ante,” Gamino said. He added: “It doesn’t surprise me because Gov. Abbott is up for reelection.”</p>
<p>Like the initiatives that came before, Gamino argued, the point of Operation Lone Star is not the stated objective, it’s the storytelling. He described it as “the same poison in a differently labeled bottle.” In his paper, Gamino recounts the visits from lawmakers based outside the Rio Grande Valley during the so-called surge of unaccompanied minors in 2014, with Republicans doing their obligatory ride-alongs with border law enforcement officers and Democrats visiting the local migrant shelters.</p>
<p>“I see it as a borderland resident,” Gamino said. “You have these politicians that parachute to the Valley do their little one-day tour, do their little photo op, do their little press conference, and then what happens? They either fly back to Austin or they fly back to Washington, D.C.”</p>
<p>Through his research, Gamino argues that border theater is not only ineffective, but also a waste of taxpayer money that could be better spent assisting the local communities and nonprofits that provide aid in the face of an obvious humanitarian crisis. “Who ends up losing is these Central American asylum-seekers who have a legitimate case,” he said. “It gets overshadowed by the whole optics of border life.”</p>

As a top legal adviser in Mexico’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Celorio led a team of lawyers in filing a historic lawsuit in August, accusing some of the United States’ most well-known gun companies of lethal negligence on a mass scale. Seeking <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-sues-several-weapons-manufacturers-us-court-2021-08-04/">$10 billion in damages</a> from a decade and a half of shoot outs and killings, the unprecedented litigation aimed to succeed where gun violence victims north of the border are all but guaranteed to fail, asking a Massachusetts federal court to hold 10 U.S.-based companies accountable for their products’ impact abroad.</p>
<p>Coming back from lunch on November 22, the date of the defendants’ deadline to respond, the Mexican lawyer-diplomat found that the companies had done exactly as he expected, arguing that a 2005 law that the National Rifle Association considers one of its greatest legislative achievements, which grants “broad immunity” to gun companies in gun violence lawsuits, is not bound by borders. It extends everywhere, they argued, including Mexico. The companies’ message, as Celorio read it, was simple: “&#8217;We don’t care what we’re doing. We don’t care if others don’t like the way we’re doing it. We’re gonna continue to do it.’”</p>
<p>The “veil of impunity,” as Celorio called it, was expected. What did catch his attention, however, was a potential seepage of politics into what Mexico insists is an apolitical legal challenge. The manufacturers, holding companies, and distributors accused in Mexico’s <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mexico-smith-wesson-complaint.pdf">139-page complaint</a> include Smith &amp; Wesson, Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, Beretta U.S.A., Beretta Holding, Century International Arms, Colt’s Manufacturing Company, Glock, Glock GES.M.B.H., Strum, Ruger &amp; Co., Witmer Public Safety Group, and Interstate Arms. In a joint filing urging the court to dismiss the suit, the firms representing the companies — among them one of the largest law firms in the world, Jones Day, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/business/jones-day-trump-election-lawsuits.html">represented President Donald Trump</a> in his efforts to overturn the 2020 election — argued that “at bottom, this case implicates a clash of national values.”</p>
<p>“Our reading is that they’re going to try to politicize this,” Celorio told The Intercept. “They’re already increasing the political cost to the judge to rule in favor of Mexico. They’re saying, ‘You’re an American. If you let this litigation pass, you don’t hold dear to your heart the American values.’”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[1] -->“They’re saying, ‘You’re an American.

<p>More than two years in the making, the story of Mexico’s lawsuit against U.S. gun companies is unfolding on multiple levels at once. The litigation itself tests whether legal protections inscribed in the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, or PLCAA, which President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/23/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-comprehensive-strategy-to-prevent-and-respond-to-gun-crime-and-ensure-public-safety/">urged Congress to repeal</a> in his national strategy to prevent gun violence earlier this year, extends to foreign countries. Should the challenge succeed, it would deal a historic blow to U.S. gun manufacturers. With limited exceptions, PLCAA has provided a near-impermeable shield to the U.S.-based small arms industry. For the gun companies, the law represents a vital bulwark against potentially industry-ending lawsuits. For gun control advocates, who point to instances like the victims of the Aurora, Colorado, theater massacre who were ordered to <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lucky-gunner-lawsuit_b_8197804">pay $203,000</a> to an ammunition dealer after losing a lawsuit on PLCAA grounds, it is the epitome of a deeply American brand of gun company impunity.</p>

<p>The legal fight is also taking place against the backdrop of a dramatic historical moment in the U.S.-Mexico security relationship. In the year before and the year after PLCAA was passed, two key events took place. First, in 2004, Congress permitted a federal assault weapons ban in the U.S. to expire. Second, in 2006, the Mexican government announced the deployment of the military into the streets in a “war” on drug trafficking. The Bush administration threw its support behind the campaign with a multibillion-dollar security aid package known as the Mérida Initiative, beginning an era of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-role-at-a-crossroads-in-mexicos-intelligence-war-on-the-cartels/2013/04/27/b578b3ba-a3b3-11e2-be47-b44febada3a8_story.html">unprecedentedly close binational collaboration</a> in the drug war’s most violent front.</p>
<p>With the shifts in law to the north and the declaration of war to the south, the stream of military-grade weaponry flowing into Mexico, legally and illegally, became a surging river of iron. In the past decade and a half, Mexico has weathered its worst period of violence since its revolution more than a century ago, with more than 400,000 people killed and paramilitary-style criminal groups building U.S.-sourced weapons arsenals capable of inflicting significant damage on government forces. Each year, according to Mexico’s complaint, an estimated 500,000 U.S.-made firearms are illegally trafficked over the border into a country with just one legal gun shop, owned and operated by the army, and some of the strictest gun laws in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>“We have at least 10 million guns in Mexico that shouldn’t be here because we don’t sell them in Mexico,” Celorio said. Criminal organizations, he added, “have a certain degree of impunity, not because Mexico doesn’t want to prosecute them, but because of their firepower.”</p>

<p>Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, popularly known as AMLO, came into office in 2018 vowing to undo the militarization of his predecessors. He declared an end to the drug war, replacing it with “<em>abrazos, no balazos</em>” — “hugs, not bullets” — a suite of social initiatives aimed at directing young people away from crime while rolling back the military’s presence in the streets. With violence still at record-high levels, some López Obrador critics say the president is naively ignoring a metastasized public safety threat and needlessly abandoning the progress made through years of joint security initiatives, while others point to the fact that the military’s role in the public security operations has in fact expanded under the current administration, particularly in the realm of immigration enforcement. The tenuous binational relationship came to a head in 2020, when U.S. authorities arrested, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/15/world/americas/mexico-defense-minister-cienfuegos.html">subsequently released</a>, Salvador Cienfuegos, the former head of the Mexican army, on drug trafficking charges. In response, an outraged López Obrador passed <a href="https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/2020/12/16/mexicos-congress-approves-law-limiting-foreign-dea-agents/3921621001/">a law</a> limiting U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration operations in Mexico. Last month, after Mexican foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard announced that the Mérida Initiative was “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/29/mexico-merida-initiative-violence/">dead</a>,” top Biden administration officials — including the heads of the departments of Justice, State, and Homeland Security — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/10/08/mexico-merida-initiative-security/">met</a> with their Mexican counterparts to hammer out a new bilateral security framework.</p>
<p>“Both sides are kind of tailoring their messaging to what they want to pressure on and the message they want to project for their own public,” Stephanie Brewer, director for Mexico and Migrant Rights at the Washington Office on Latin America, told The Intercept. The Biden administration, Brewer argues, overwhelmingly approaches the binational relationship through the prism of stopping migration to the north. “This is the major challenge right now facing U.S.-Mexico security cooperation and relations more broadly: the disproportionate weight and also very counterproductive form and direction of U.S. immigration policies, border policies specifically.”</p>
<p>By focusing so much energy on migration, Brewer contends that progress on other key issues in the binational relationship, such as the steady flow of weapons south, has suffered. While the two countries’ new “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/08/joint-statement-u-s-mexico-high-level-security-dialogue/">Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public Health, and Safe Communities</a>” does touch on arms trafficking, Brewer said, “there’s no revolutionary change in approach there.” Given the enormous power of the U.S. gun lobby and the protections in law granted to gun companies, Brewer is doubtful that the Mexican government’s legal challenge will bring about official change either. “The gun lawsuit is a very powerful and I think really relevant action,” she said. “But its ultimate impact might be symbolic rather than legal.”</p>
<p>Mexico’s legal complaint is careful to make clear that its targets are private entities engaged in allegedly negligent business practices — not the U.S. government nor the legitimacy of the Second Amendment. “It’s a tort law case,” Celorio said. Still, it is no secret that the litigation is one piece in a broader effort to reframe the country’s relationship to Washington on matters of violence and security. On November 22, the same day that the gun companies filed their responses, Ebrard <a href="https://www.gob.mx/sre/en/articulos/at-the-un-foreign-secretary-ebrard-proposes-a-halt-to-arms-trafficking-288731?idiom=en">appeared</a> before the U.N. Security Council to present a proposal for an international strategy to combat small arms trafficking. The foreign minister explicitly connected the proposal to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>“The Mexican government would never try, attempt, or give a signal that we want a change in domestic law in the U.S. We respect that sovereignty,” Celorio said. “But we’re dying. We cannot wait until things happen. So that’s why we’re resorting to other actions.”</p>

<h2>From El Paso to Black Thursday</h2>
<p>The genesis of Mexico’s lawsuit was August 3, 2019, when a gunman walked into a Walmart busy with back-to-school shoppers in El Paso, Texas, and murdered 23 people while wounding 23 others.</p>
<p>Eight of the victims were Mexican nationals. Many of the others were Mexican American. The youngest victim was 2 years old. The oldest was 82. Not since the early 1900s, when posses of vigilantes and border lawmen lynched and murdered them <a href="https://refusingtoforget.org/the-history/">by the hundreds</a>, had people of Mexican descent in the Texas borderlands sustained such a bloody and targeted terror attack. Authorities said the alleged shooter, 21-year-old Patrick Wood Crusius, bought his GP WASR-10 semiautomatic rifle and 1,000 rounds of ammunition online, then drove all night from his home in Allen, Texas, with an explicit plan to murder Mexicans and repel the “Hispanic invasion of Texas.”</p>
<p>Facing 90 federal charges, including 45 for hate crimes, Crusius pleaded not guilty in the case. A trial date has <a href="https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/crime/2021/11/18/el-paso-walmart-shooting-trial-march-2023-patrick-crusius/8673673002/">not been set</a>.</p>
<p>Celorio was in Mexico City when the news broke, having returned from a five-year posting at Mexico’s embassy in Washington, D.C., where he was section head of Hispanic and Migration Affairs. Inside the AMLO government, career officials worried that El Paso could be the beginning of something even worse. “August 2019, remember where we were in terms of white supremacism and white nationalism,” Celorio said. “We were thinking that there were going to be copycats because he basically called on others to grab their own weapons and stop the invasion.”</p>
<p>Ebrard tasked Celorio with finding a way to hold the shooter accountable and prevent further bloodshed. He encouraged his legal adviser to be “inventive,” in Celorio’s words, and “courageous.” Celorio traveled to El Paso and spent days meeting with prosecutors, reviewing video of the killings, and speaking with survivors. He contacted Jonathan Lowy, chief counsel and vice president of legal at Brady Legal, the litigation arm of the Brady Campaign, the country’s most prominent gun control organization. Celorio also spoke with Steve Shadowen, a Texas-based civil rights attorney who he had gotten to know through litigation involving Border Patrol agents fatally shooting Mexicans across the border. Both Lowy and Shadowen are now co-counsels in the suit against the U.S. gun companies.</p>
<p>Together, the lawyers discussed what it was about El Paso that Mexico hoped to address. For Celorio, part of the motivation was rooted in “the fact that someone inspired by white nationalism” could so easily acquire the means to bring their murderous fantasies to life. Early ideas for a legal response included suing Crusius, Walmart, or the city of El Paso. The problem, Celorio explained, was legal standing. “The government of Mexico wasn’t there,” he said. “You can sue representing all Mexicans, but it’s difficult.”</p>
<p>Two and half months after the El Paso attack, events in the Mexican state of Sinaloa prompted the government to widen its approach to the gun issue.</p>
<p>On October 17, 2019, Mexican security forces, reportedly operating under <a href="https://mvsnoticias.com/noticias/seguridad-y-justicia/el-viaje-secreto-de-la-dea-a-culiacan/">heavy Trump administration pressure</a>, arrested Ovidio Guzmán Lopez, son of the famed Joaquin &#8220;El Chapo&#8221; Loera Gúzman, in the Sinaloan capital of Culiacán for extradition to the U.S. on drug trafficking charges.</p>

<p>What happened next would <a href="https://www.mexicoviolence.org/battles-after-the-battle">go down</a> in local memory as “<a href="https://www.mexicoviolence.org/battles-after-battle/conclusion">Jueves Negro</a>” — Black Thursday. Hundreds of gunmen, including some who were drawn by social media calls for paid volunteers and then outfitted with guns, mobilized a blindingly swift counteroffensive. They rolled into the capital in armor-plated vehicles mounted with .50 caliber machine guns. They cut off entry and exit points into the city, staged a successful jailbreak, burned vehicles and homes, then surrounded a housing complex for the families of Mexican soldiers, effectively taking the wives and children inside hostage while they demanded Guzmán’s release. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/the-weekly/el-chapo-guzman-son.html">Video of the siege</a> showed parents hiding behind cars with small children while gunfire rang out, and civilians evacuated businesses and sheltered in restaurant kitchens. Several weapons manufactured by the companies that would become defendants in Mexico’s gun lawsuit were <a href="https://armamentresearch.com/weapons-used-by-cartel-sicarios-in-culiacan-mexico/">observed at the scene</a>, including Colt’s AR-15 platforms, Beretta and Glock handguns, and a Barrett M82-series anti-material sniper rifle, a behemoth weapon designed to disable and destroy battlefield equipment at long distances. By the day’s end, the Mexican military announced that it was terminating operations in the city, and Guzmán was free. Fourteen people were dead. The citizens of Culiacán were <a href="https://www.mexicoviolence.org/battles-after-battle/echoes-and-aftermath">left to pick up the pieces</a> after the traumatic ordeal.</p>

<p>Black Thursday’s binational implications were stark: a criminal network whose financial power is derived from U.S. customers used U.S.-made weapons to terrorize a state capital and thwart a U.S.-based extradition effort. Other touchstone events soon followed. Less than three weeks later, on November 4, 2019, a three-vehicle convoy was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-53655483">ambushed on a desert highway</a> in the Mexican state of Sonora. The attackers disabled the vehicles with a deluge of gunfire, then set them on fire. The victims who died, three women and six children, were members of a Mormon community that has lived in the area for years. They were all dual U.S.-Mexican citizens, making the massacre a kind of grim reversal of the attack in El Paso, with Americans now gunned down on Mexican soil. Eight months later, the spectacle of extraordinary violence landed on the very doorstep of the country’s most powerful officials. As dawn broke on June 26, 2020, an estimated 50 gunmen carrying assault rifles, .50 caliber sniper rifles, and grenade launchers attacked the head of Mexico City’s police, <a href="https://english.elpais.com/usa/2021-06-21/omar-garcia-harfuch-the-mexican-police-chief-who-survived-being-shot-at-414-times.html">Omar García Harfuch</a>, while he was driven through the capital. Harfuch’s vehicle was shot more than 400 times. Both of his bodyguards were killed. Harfuch was shot three times but survived.</p>
<p>Together, the events in Sinaloa, Sonora, and Mexico City crystalized a realization for Celorio and his colleagues: The phenomenon Mexico hoped to address was bigger than El Paso. “The common factor in all of them was the firepower,” he said. What happened in Texas reflected what Mexico has been living through for years, with the key difference being that in Mexico, the guns fueling the violence are the illegal product of massive and illicit cross-border trade.</p>

<h2>Willfully Blind</h2>
<p>With Ebrard’s support, Celorio began coordinating a legal strategy that would target the flow at its source. His team researched the contours of gun violence and the illicit arms trade in Mexico. They found that between 70 to 90 percent of all guns recovered at crime scenes in the country are U.S.-made, with firearms produced by six manufacturers — Smith &amp; Wesson, Beretta, Century Arms, Colt, Glock, and Ruger — turning up most often. While <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/720/712530.pdf">previous government estimates</a> put the number of firearms illegally trafficked into Mexico annually at around 200,000, the complaint Mexico filed in August alleged that “between 342,000 and 597,000” of the companies’ guns are trafficked into the country every year.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[8](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[8] -->
<p>The legal team observed what drug war trackers have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/mexico-losing-control/mexico-drug-cartels-sniper-rifles-us-gun-policy/">long known</a>, that in an illicit industry that generates an estimated $250 million annually, Barrett’s powerful .50 caliber sniper rifles stand out as both a tactical asset and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-mexico-arms-barrett-idAFKBN2F7151">a status symbol</a>. In 2016, the government noted, gunmen in the state of Michoacán used a Barrett to shoot down a helicopter belonging to the state attorney general, killing the pilot and three officers on board. “Barrett knows that its dealers sell these military guns to traffickers, often in bulk, to arm the cartels that use them to battle Mexican military and police who are trying to stop the drug trade,” the government alleged. According to the complaint, Mexican soldiers recovered 227 of the company’s .50 caliber rifles from 2010 to 2018.</p>
<p>Barrett wasn’t alone in appealing to organized crime, though. With its patent on the hugely popular AR-15, Colt’s guns turned up at more crime scenes than any other manufacturer’s weapons, Mexico told the court, with more than 2,000 weapons recovered between 2006 and 2018. “Colt does not even try to hide its pandering to the criminal market in Mexico,” the government complained, pointing to three .38 caliber pistols — “El Jefe,” “El Grito,” and the “Emiliano Zapata 1911” — as explicitly marketed to Mexican buyers. A Zapata pistol, named after the Mexican revolutionary and inscribed with the words, “It is better to die standing than to live on your knees,” was used to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/04/world/americas/mexico-lawsuit-gun-companies.html">assassinate</a> Mexican investigative journalist Miroslava Breach Velducea in 2017, adding another name to the grim tally that makes Mexico <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/22/mexico-journalists-deadly-cpr-press-freedom">the most world’s most dangerous country</a> for journalists.</p>
<p>Mexico couched its argument for damages in history, describing how the 2004 expiration of the assault weapons ban in the U.S. altered life for the worse. Prior to the expiration, from 1999 to 2004, murders in the country were on the decline, the complaint said. Once the ban expired, the defendants ramped up their production and distribution of military-grade weapons. “Border-state gun dealers now sell twice as many guns as dealers in other areas of the country,” the complaint said. According to the government, in the years immediately following the expiration, illegal gun ownership per capita in Mexico increased tenfold and the homicide rate increased by 45 percent: “No nation other than Mexico experienced a similar homicide surge during this period.” In 2003, there were fewer than 2,500 homicides committed with a gun in Mexico. By 2019, there were more than 23,000.</p>
<p>“The magnitude of these deaths is so extensive that, beginning in 2005, it significantly affected the life expectancy of all Mexicans,” the government said, noting that while the life expectancy in the country increased by approximately six months from 2000 to 2005, “it decreased by about the same amount from 2005 to 2010.” Today, Mexico is home to the third most gun-related deaths in the world, and even though the country has less than half of the population of the U.S., a Mexican is more likely to be killed with a U.S.-made gun than a U.S. citizen. Murder is the leading cause of death among Mexican teenagers and young adults, the complaint said, and last year more than 40 percent of Mexicans under the age of 18 reported frequently seeing or hearing gunfire in their day-to-day lives. Citing the Institute for Economics and Peace, an international think tank, the government said that the financial impact of the violence in 2019 alone was $238 billion, more than 20 percent of Mexico’s gross domestic product.</p>

<p>At the core of Mexico’s claim is an argument that the gun companies could make any number of changes in their business practices to help stem the violence — examples the government cited included “limiting sales of multiple guns,” “mandatory background checks for secondary gun sales,” “curbs on straw purchasers” (individuals who are paid to purchase weapons for a third-party buyer), and “a restriction on assault weapons sales” — but that in the interest of making money, they deliberately chose not to. As part of its legal challenge, Mexico is seeking internal records detailing what measurers the gun manufacturers are currently taking to limit the flow of their products into criminal hands. If successful, the release of such information could offer a rare window into the gun industry’s mechanisms for tracing products that turn up at crime scenes — thanks to the 2003 <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/RS22458.pdf">Tiahrt Amendment</a>, another <a href="https://madison.com/ct/news/nra-led-gun-lobby-wields-powerful-influence-over-atf-u-s-politics/article_eac60416-0868-11e0-8b0d-001cc4c03286.html">NRA lobbying achievement</a>, those records have been shielded from public review for nearly two decades.</p>
<p>As for PLCAA, Mexico argues that the law is a nonissue in the case. The Supreme Court “has repeatedly held that where conduct in one nation causes injury in another the ‘default rule for tort cases’ is that ‘the local law of the state where the injury occurred determines the rights and liabilities of the parties,’” the government said in its complaint. When “U.S.-based corporations cause injury abroad to foreign sovereigns, the U.S. Constitution and statutes allow those sovereigns to sue for ‘violations of their own laws and to invoke federal diversity jurisdiction as a basis for proceeding in U.S. courts.’” In other words, because the harms happened in Mexico, Mexican law applies. Rendering PLCAA even more irrelevant, Mexico argued, was the fact that the legislation was clearly passed to address alleged harms on U.S. soil alone: “Every aspect of PLCAA confirms that the U.S. Congress enacted that statute with only U.S. domestic concerns in mind.”</p>
<p>While the U.S. is free to chart its own course in balancing “the financial interests of the gun industry and the rights of victims within its jurisdiction,” the Mexican government argued, Mexico has the right to do the same: “Just as defendants may not dump toxic waste or other pollutants to poison Mexicans across the border, they may not send their weapons of war into the hands of the cartels, causing repeated and grievous harm, and then claim immunity from accountability.” It is not as though the companies “live on another planet in which they are sheltered from news of their corrupt dealers, the trafficking of their guns into Mexico, and the devastating damage suffered by the government and its people,” the complaint said. “They simply choose to act as if they are blind — willfully blind — to those facts.”</p>
<p>By increasing the production of military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, marketing to criminals, and using distribution networks known to feed into their armories, the gun manufacturers have made a deliberate choice to “maintain their supply chain to the cartels,” Mexico argued. The companies have “refused calls for reform because, from the perspective of their bottom lines, their distribution systems are huge successes,” the government alleged. “Their supply of guns to the criminal market in Mexico is a feature, not a bug.”</p>

<h2>Pandora’s Box</h2>
<p>A month after Mexico filed suit, Steve Shadowen, the Texas-based co-counsel, was feeling confident. “This case is rock solid,” Shadowen told The Intercept in September.</p>
<p>While outside legal analysts have described Mexico’s lawsuit as <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/07/1025636092/mexico-lawsuit-united-states-gun-companies-analysis">a long shot</a>, Shadowen, a tort law expert, believes the defendants have the scope of PLCAA all wrong. “Yes, the U.S. has a statute, OK, but Mexico does not have that statute. Instead, it has tort law,” he said. “We will prove that the tort law of Mexico says that Mexico should be able to recover here. This PLCAA statute is an outlier in the world, generally, and it certainly does not reflect the social policy or the law of Mexico.”</p>
<p>The veteran attorney predicted that his team would have “a big battle with the defendants” over the legislation. The <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/zjpqkwldypx/11122021mexico.pdf">58-page joint motion</a> for dismissal that the gun companies filed last month indicates he was right.</p>
<p>“Unable to control cartel violence within its own borders,” Mexico is attempting to shift the blame, the companies argued. “The Mexican government wants firearms, all firearms, out of Mexico,” they said. “Taking the necessary steps — improving border security, rooting out corruption, and adequately funding police and military, for starters — would require time, resources, and the political will to take responsibility for a massive social problem.” Instead of taking responsibility, Mexico is trying to circumvent an ongoing diplomatic dispute by appealing to the courts, the companies said. “By seeking to bankrupt U.S. gun makers, this gambit not only threatens America’s constitutional freedoms, but also the careful balance of firearms regulations set by Congress and state legislatures,” they argued. “This Court need not play along.”</p>
<p>To prove its case, Mexico relied on an “attenuated chain” of events, the companies said, that ran from production by the gun manufacturers, to the wholesaler, to individual gun stores, to straw purchasers, to cartels, to violence in the streets, to damages incurred by the government. The defendants argued that the Mexican government did not and could not prove all those steps, but even if it could, the defendants would still be shielded from liability. “In 2005, Congress enacted the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act to prohibit precisely the type of claims asserted in this case,” they said. And even if the companies did know that some weapons would be sold to dealers who would then sell them to criminals, they were still be protected: “After all, car companies know their cars will be used for reckless driving, knife companies know their knives will be used to hurt others, and beer companies know that minors drink, but none of this knowledge makes those companies liable for resulting harms.”</p>

<p>Mexico’s “real hope,” the companies alleged, “appears to be convincing the Court that the PLCAA does not apply at all to protect U.S. firearms companies against foreign plaintiffs.” The claim had “no merit,” they said: “By its plain terms, the PLCAA applies to all suits brought in U.S. courts against U.S. defendants for conduct in the U.S., regardless of where the alleged harms occurred.” If Mexico prevailed, the companies argued, it would open a Pandora’s box of legal challenges, blowing a “gaping hole” in the protections PLCAA was designed to provide.</p>
<p>“The history of firearms law in the United States is a history of legislation and regulation continually calibrated to protect Americans’ constitutional rights while also protecting people from a potentially dangerous product; the Court should not allow that incremental evolution to be upended by a lawsuit filed by a foreign power,” they said. “Under bedrock principles of international law, a foreign nation cannot use its own law to reach across borders and impose liability based on conduct in another country that was lawful when it occurred there. By trying to do so, Mexico is effectively seeking to impose its own gun control policies on U.S. firearms companies in disregard of the choices made by domestic legislatures and embedded in the federal and many state constitutions.”</p>

<h2>Political Animals</h2>
<p>The gun company immunity that Mexico is contending with can be traced to a man with deep ties to the border. Born in 1913 and raised in Laredo, Texas, <a href="https://fieldofvision.org/the-rifleman">Harlon Carter</a> followed his father into the U.S. Border Patrol, eventually becoming chief and overseeing “Operation Wetback,” one of the largest deportation operations in U.S. history. A lifelong pistol shooter, Carter joined the NRA’s board of directors in 1951. At the time, the NRA’s primary mission was marksmanship education and supporting hunting and sport shooting. Carter would change all of that.</p>
<p>By 1965, Carter was president of the NRA. Ten years later, having secured a lifetime position on the organization’s executive council, he became the NRA’s chief lobbyist. By that point, a contentious rift had developed among members who supported the group’s original mission and those who believed it should shift focus to unrestrained weapons access and militant gun control opposition. Carter was an ardent supporter of the latter. “We can win it on a simple concept,” he wrote in a letter to NRA leadership. “No compromise. No gun legislation.”</p>
<p>In 1977, Carter and his supporters made their move, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-nras-true-believers-converted-a-marksmanship-group-into-a-mighty-gun-lobby/2013/01/12/51c62288-59b9-11e2-88d0-c4cf65c3ad15_story.html">seizing control</a> of the NRA at a dramatic annual meeting in Ohio. The former Border Patrol chief’s militancy became the ethos of the NRA. It wasn’t until 1981 that his personal relationship to firearms was fully illuminated, when the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/04/us/hard-line-opponent-of-gun-laws-wins-new-term-at-helm-of-rifle.html">reported</a> that the NRA pioneer was convicted of murdering a Mexican boy 50 years prior. The victim was 15-year-old Ramón Casiano. In 1931, a 17-year-old Carter confronted Casiano and his friends while carrying a shotgun. Carter’s mother suspected the boys might have information about the theft of the family’s car. Carter ordered them to come with him for questioning. The boys refused. Casiano pulled out a pocketknife. Carter asked Casiano if he believed he wouldn’t shoot. Casiano said he wouldn’t. Carter pulled the trigger. Though he claimed self-defense, Carter was convicted of murder and sentenced to three years. The case was vacated two years later, after a court ruled that the jury had been given improper instructions.</p>

<p>Carter died in 1991, but his legacy lived on. That same year, Wayne LaPierre assumed the role of executive vice president of the NRA. LaPierre was firmly in Carter’s camp during the NRA’s 1977 leadership coup and later took over his old job as the organization’s chief lobbyist. Two days after Carter’s passing, LaPierre eulogized his predecessor as “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/22/us/harlon-b-carter-longtime-head-of-rifle-association-dies-at-78.html">our champion and fiercest warrior</a>.” PLCAA was arguably LaPierre’s greatest tribute to Carter’s legacy, a historic piece of legislation resulting from years of heavy lobbying. LaPierre, by then the NRA’s chief executive, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/21/politics/congress-passes-new-legal-shield-for-gun-industry.html">told</a> the New York Times that it was the most significant victory for the gun lobby in nearly 50 years.</p>
<p>In the mid-2000s, as violence in Mexico surged, LaPierre developed a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/americas/03/26/lapierre.guns.mexico/index.html">punchy line</a> for deflecting criticisms that U.S. gun policy might have some relationship to the violence, particularly when those criticisms suggested a reinstatement of an assault weapons ban: “Our rights are not what’s wrong.”</p>
<p>Arturo Sarukhán was the Mexican ambassador to the U.S. at the time, serving under then-President Felipe Calderón. “When I arrived as ambassador, I sent Wayne LaPierre a letter saying, ‘Look, I’m not here to challenge the Second Amendment. That’s a sovereign decision of the American people. It’s in the Constitution in its amendments, but what I am convinced of is that the Second Amendment wasn’t written to allow Americans to buy armor piercing ammo to hunt deer or to illicitly traffic guns across an international border. So why don’t we talk?’” Sarukhán recalled in an interview with The Intercept. LaPierre never replied. “We called this office three times to follow up on the letter,” Sarukhán said. “They didn’t even pick up the call.”</p>
<p>In 2012, <a href="https://ftp.iza.org/dp7098.pdf">a paper</a> published by researchers at New York University and the University of Massachusetts Amherst found that the expiration of the assault weapons ban contributed to “substantial increases in homicides” in Mexican border communities. The following year, the University of San Diego’s Trans-Border Institute estimated that without gun trafficking to Mexico, roughly 47 percent of federally licensed firearms dealers would “<a href="https://catcher.sandiego.edu/items/peacestudies/way_of_the_gun.pdf">cease to exist</a>.” For Sarukhán, the relationship between the weapons, the violence, and the money was obvious. “The sunset clause of the assault weapons ban coincides with the exponential growth of seizures of assault weapons and semi-automatic weapons in Mexico,” he said. “There’s a direct correlation.” Doing something about the issue, then and now, was another matter. “We all know that there won’t be an assault weapons ban anytime soon in Washington,” Sarukhán said. The former Mexican ambassador is likely right. Though Biden <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/10/985514254/biden-wants-new-ban-on-assault-style-weapons-what-lessons-were-learned-from-the-">renewed his calls</a> for an assault weapons ban in the spring, the prospect of Congress passing significant gun control legislation is considered <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/05/biden-gun-violence-legislation-519625">unlikely</a>.</p>
<p class="p1"><!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[14](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A1%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="1"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[14] --></p>
<p>Sarukhán is a staunch critic of the AMLO administration’s security policies. “López Obrador’s &#8216;hugs and bullets&#8217; are creating more homicides than Calderón’s militarization of the war against drugs,” he said. Sarukhán argues that by pushing away U.S. involvement in shared problems, Mexico only hurts itself. Still, his criticisms of the administration’s broader posture aside, Sarukhán supports the government’s lawsuit. He pursued a similar project as ambassador, he said, albeit focused on gun shops rather manufacturers, but ran out of time before the changing of administrations. “I think the Mexican government does right in doing this,” he said. “It’s an important shot across the bow.”</p>
<p>While the national gun conversation tends to focus on issues within U.S. borders, <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/720/712530.pdf">a report to Congress</a> in February revealed significant holes in the government’s system for stopping the flow of weapons south. The Government Accountability Office told lawmakers that the top U.S. federal agencies tasked with stopping illicit cross-border trafficking — the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, or ATF; Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations; and the State Department — routinely fail to communicate with one another or monitor the efficacy of their efforts.</p>
<p>“None of the agencies have fully developed performance measures for their efforts to disrupt firearms trafficking to Mexico, and thus they have limited ability to assess progress,” the report said.</p>
<p>Keith Heinzerling had an up-close look at U.S. efforts to curb the flow of guns south, serving two tours as the ATF’s country attaché in Mexico before retiring in 2016. While he pushed back on some of the depictions of the impact U.S. gun policy has had on the country — Heinzerling believes the expiration of the assault weapons ban had little relationship to violence, for example, and he suspects Mexico’s lawsuit is little more than “smoke and mirrors” — the retired ATF agent acknowledged that there are indeed major issues impeding the interdiction of southbound weapons.</p>
<p>In Mexico, U.S. federal agents lack the sweeping authorities they enjoy stateside and as a result are encouraged to work very closely with ostensibly vetted partners. “When you work hand in hand, you’re worried about issues of corruption and information maybe going the wrong direction,” Heinzerling told The Intercept. As an example, he pointed to the case of <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/01/26/mexico-drug-war-el-chapo-garcia-luna-trial/">Genaro García Luna</a>, the former Mexican public security chief once <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/magazine/13officer-t.html">considered</a> Washington’s greatest drug war ally who is now facing federal drug trafficking charges in New York.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest problems, however, are not on the border, Heinzerling argued, but in Washington. In a move straight out of the Harlon Carter playbook, the NRA has waged <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/02/us/politics/atf-nra-guns.html">a multidecade campaign</a> wherever possible to undermine the ATF, which LaPierre once referred to as “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1995/05/01/nra-official-defends-terms-used-in-letter/eb75fcd2-faa9-49b9-8f31-04701763b5a1/">jack-booted government thugs</a>.” As a byproduct of those efforts, the agency <a href="https://time.com/6097891/aft-director-david-chipman-gun-control/">hasn’t had a confirmed director since 2013</a>. Biden’s pick to head the organization, David Chipman, a 25-year ATF veteran who worked as policy adviser for gun control groups, faced heated Republican pushback in a Senate hearing earlier this year, with Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley equating his appointment to putting “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/05/26/us/biden-news-today#david-chipman-atf-senate">antifa in charge of the Portland Police Department</a>.” According to Heinzerling, the absence of leadership has had a devastating impact on morale that trickles into important missions like cross-border weapons trafficking.</p>
<p>“It’s a political animal — the NRA,” he said. “All the people in ATF want to do the right thing, believe me, but we can’t even get a director confirmed because it’s all politics. It’s insane.”</p>

<h2>The Never-Ending Arms Race</h2>
<p>Ieva Jusionyte, an associate professor of international security and anthropology at Brown University, has spent years studying gun trafficking to Mexico at the ground level, spending her days with Mexican purchasers of illegal U.S.-made weapons, observing Mexican government gun buyback programs in action, and interviewing rank-and-file members of Mexican organized crime for a forthcoming book.</p>
<p>Attempts to understand the U.S. and Mexico strictly as two separate countries with their own separate laws obscures the ways in which those laws inform conditions on the ground, she argued. “This is a regional political economy of violence where different laws on both sides create opportunities for various criminal activities that increase violence,” Jusionyte told The Intercept. Rising violence, she added, creates economic opportunities for U.S. gun companies. “Insecurity in Latin America — in Central America, in Mexico — is a big market for U.S. gunmakers because they equip both sides,” Jusionyte said. “They sell the guns to the police forces and security forces and then they allow their guns to illegally supply those organized crime groups that security forces then fight against. So it’s a big win for gunmakers.”</p>
<p>Jusionyte’s observation points to one of the great ironies of Mexico’s lawsuit: While one arm of the Mexican government is supposedly attempting to bankrupt the U.S. gun industry, another is feeding it millions of dollars a year.</p>

<p>Over the past decade and half, the Mexican military has become one of the biggest government purchasers of U.S.-made weapons in the world. From 2015 and 2017 alone, legal U.S. guns and ammo exports to Mexico <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2018/04/26/mexico-arms-trade-us-gun-sales/">surged to nearly $123 million</a>, more than a dozen times what it was from 2002 to 2004, making the Mexican military the largest Latin American buyer of U.S.-made arms by far. As sales have skyrocketed, some U.S. lawmakers have grown <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/10/06/mexico-weapons-sale-biden-murder-kidnapping/">increasingly concerned</a> at the repeated evidence of U.S.-made guns flowing to Mexican security forces with abhorrent human rights records. Scores of Colt rifles, for example, were sent to municipal police in the city of Iguala both before and after the police there were implicated in the 2014 disappearance of 43 college students, <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2015/05/04/how-43-students-disappeared-in-mexico-part-1/">one of the most infamous crimes in Mexican history</a>.</p>
<p>The effect Mexico’s lawsuit might have on the multimillion-dollar exchanges between the military and U.S. gun companies remains to be seen. Three of the companies currently being sued by Mexico —  <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.afsc.org/resource/fact-sheet-sig-sauer-arms-exports-to-mexico__;!!Iwwt!AtHvTAnZPHWMhFTYblJeiGNsOWR1-BixxLbIDMm5qGzaH-u33JMxRJi4Mfw$">Colt, Glock</a>, and <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.stopusarmstomexico.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/THE-LEGAL-AND-ILLEGAL-GUN-TRADE-TO-MEXICO_August2018.pdf__;!!Iwwt!AtHvTAnZPHWMhFTYblJeiGNsOWR1-BixxLbIDMm5qGzaH-u33JMxE6_54Xk$">Barrett</a> — have sold weapons to the Mexican military in the past. So far, Celorio said, his office has received “no pushback at all” from its military colleagues.</p>
<p>Despite its stated commitment to demilitarizing Mexico, the AMLO administration is currently presiding over the largest <a href="https://estepais.com/tendencias_y_opiniones/marcha-militar/de-la-militarizacion-al-militarismo-ciclo-incontenible/">deployment of troops</a> in the streets in recent history. The continued reliance on the military in public security, and in particular for U.S.-backed migration crackdowns, has drawn <a href="https://www.wola.org/analysis/the-bicentennial-framework-opportunities-and-challenges-as-u-s-mexico-security-cooperation-begins-a-new-chapter/">fierce criticism</a> from human rights advocates. Celorio is attuned to the critiques. To draw down the military’s presence in the streets, he argued, “the criminal gangs, their firepower has to decrease.”</p>
<p>“There’s a spiral of violence that is escalating because of the illicit traffic of guns,” Celorio said. “We always talk about the wholesale of guns, the big shipments, and how Saudi Arabia shouldn’t divert their weapons to Yemen,” he said. “But what about what is happening in the stores in Laredo?”</p>
<p>Celorio said those who might doubt the sincerity of Mexico’s current efforts are mistaken. “We’re doing this for real,” he said. The litigation, he argued, is evidence of a changing Mexico. “It’s a Mexico that believes in itself, saying, ‘We’re no more, we’re no less than any other country, but in the equality of rights, we’re Mexico, and if we need to defend ourselves, we’ll do it,’” he said. “That’s a Mexico that is transforming.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Daniel Hale,</u> the former U.S. Air Force intelligence analyst currently imprisoned for releasing top-secret documents on the government’s drone program, was given an international award for whistleblowing Wednesday. <a href="https://www.blueprintforfreespeech.net/">Blueprint for Free Speech</a>, a nonprofit charity based in Australia, gave Hale its international prize, stating that his actions “prompted greater openness from the Obama administration about their drone policy, and greater demands for ongoing accountability to the public.”</p>
<p>Hale was <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/07/27/daniel-hale-drone-leak-sentencing/">sentenced to 45 months in prison</a> in July after pleading guilty to violating a single count of the Espionage Act, a controversial 1917 law often used against individuals who share national security information with the press. Originally intended for foreign spies, the law bars the accused from using their motivations for leaking as a defense. The judge, Liam O’Grady of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, dismissed four other charges against Hale with prejudice.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>During Hale’s prosecution, government lawyers, who compared Hale to a heroin dealer and urged the court to deliver the harshest possible sentence, 11 years in prison, strongly implied that Hale was the source of The Intercept’s 2015 series “<a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/drone-papers/">The Drone Papers</a>.” As a matter of policy, The Intercept does not comment on the identity of its confidential sources.</p>
<p>Prior to his sentencing, Hale <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/07/24/daniel-hale-assassination-program-drone-leak/">submitted</a> a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21015583-daniel-hale-letter-to-judge-liam-ogrady">handwritten letter</a> to the court in which he detailed his involvement in drone operations in Afghanistan and Yemen — in addition to the Air Force, Hale was also employed as an intelligence contractor. He wrote that he observed the military routinely label all “military age males” killed in drone strikes as “enemies killed in action,” regardless of what they were doing or whether the government knew their identities.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[1] -->
<p>U.S. drone operations abroad have <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/projects/drone-war">killed between 9,000 and 17,000 people since 2004</a>, according to an estimate from the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, including as many as 2,200 children and multiple U.S. citizens. The organization puts the overall civilian casualty estimate from U.S. strikes worldwide at between 910 and 2,200 individuals.</p>
<p>Hale told the court that he leaked documents on the drone program out of a sense of moral duty. “I am here because I stole something that was never mine to take — precious human life,” he said at his sentencing. “I couldn’t keep living in a world in which people pretend that things weren’t happening that were. Please, your honor, forgive me for taking papers instead of human lives.”</p>

<p>Betsy Reed, editor-in-chief of The Intercept, said in a statement at the time of Hale&#8217;s sentencing that the documents Hale was accused of leaking “revealed the truth about the U.S. government’s secretive, murderous drone war, including that the killing of civilians was far more widespread than previously acknowledged.”</p>
<p>Among the Blueprint for Free Speech’s previous award recipients are other past targets of U.S. national security leak prosecutions, including Chelsea Manning and Reality Winner.</p>
<p>Hale, who has <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/daniel-hale-drone-wars.html">personally rejected</a><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/daniel-hale-drone-wars.html"> the “whistleblower” label</a>, is currently incarcerated at USP Marion, a federal penitentiary in Marion, Illinois, where he has been held in a “Communications Management Unit” since October. Commonly known as CMUs, the highly restrictive units are ostensibly meant to house the most dangerous of individuals and by design cut off virtually all access to the outside world. According to the <a href="https://ccrjustice.org/sites/default/files/assets/files/CCR_CMU_2014Documents-20140709.pdf">Center for Constitutional Rights</a>, “being sent to a CMU is uniquely stigmatizing because it is described publicly as a terrorist unit.” In October, <a href="https://thedissenter.org/drone-whistleblower-daniel-hale-sent/">journalist Kevin Gosztola </a><a href="https://thedissenter.org/drone-whistleblower-daniel-hale-sent/">reported</a> that Hale is “the first person convicted for an unauthorized disclosure of information to the press to be incarcerated in a CMU.”</p>
<p>Last month, Hale’s <a href="https://standwithdanielhale.org/">network of supporters</a> reported that he was poring over a large batch of letters and books and that he was eager to receive “articles and news about anything that&#8217;s not foreign policy.” The support group has created a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-whistleblower-daniel-hale-fund?utm_campaign=p_lico+share-sheet+spider1c&amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_source=customer">GoFundMe page</a> to “help alleviate the financial duress caused by a decade’s long criminal investigation, prosecution and now, incarceration.” Hale’s expected release date is July, 5, 2024.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Families in the</u> Mexican state of Tamaulipas were left reeling last week after a federal judge <a href="https://www.animalpolitico.com/2021/11/juez-libera-12-marinos-acusados-dos-desapariciones-nuevo-laredo-repetir-proceso/">released</a> from custody 12 members of an elite <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3abzpj/us-trained-mexican-marines-charged-kidnapping-nuevo-laredo">U.S.-trained</a> special operations unit accused of kidnapping their loved ones. According to the families, the Mexican marines orchestrated a wave of terror during their six-month deployment in the city of Nuevo Laredo, just across the border from Laredo, Texas, that resulted in at least 47 abductions in 2018. The bodies of 19 victims were later recovered, some bearing signs of torture; 25 people remain missing, including a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/12/18/mexican-marines-kidnappings-forgotten-american-426495">teenage U.S. citizen</a>. The youngest of the victims was a 14-year-old boy.</p>
<p>Drawing <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=23157&amp;LangID=E">international condemnation</a>, the disappearances in Tamaulipas are significant not only for the acts the Mexican marines are accused of perpetrating but also because the marines, as an institution, have been the U.S. government’s <a href="https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/world/article24739117.html">most trusted drug war ally</a> in Mexico for more than a decade, receiving extensive training, operational support, and praise from the U.S. military and law enforcement agencies. A new database released this week provides the most detailed picture to date of what the U.S. government’s relationship to the Mexican marines has looked like on the ground, revealing the extensive tactical training that the Pentagon has provided to the marines’ elite units and other elements of the Mexican military.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>Launched by the <a href="https://www.mexicoviolence.org/">Mexico Violence Resource Project</a> at the University of California, San Diego, <a href="https://www.mexicoviolence.org/military-training">the database</a> allows users to search through more than 6,000 instances of U.S. military training for Mexican security forces spanning nearly two decades and totaling nearly $144 million in U.S. taxpayer funding. According to Michael Lettieri, a managing editor of the Mexico Violence Resource Project and lead analyst and designer of the project, the data, drawn from annual Pentagon and State Department reports to Congress, reveals that tactical and lethal training for Mexican military units — especially the Mexican marines — by the U.S. military has increased substantially over the past decade while human rights instruction has sharply decreased.</p>
<p>“One hand is saying, ‘We’re building up the justice system and the civilian police,’ and the other hand is saying, ‘We’re making your military really good at killing people,’” Lettieri told The Intercept. “I don&#8217;t know that it’s an incoherent foreign policy, but it’s certainly a slightly deceptive one.”</p>

<p>Last month, top officials from the U.S. and Mexico <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-sees-us-security-deal-replace-merida-initiative-sources-2021-10-07/">met</a> to discuss replacing the Mérida Initiative, a $3.5 billion aid package that has been the public face of U.S.-Mexico security cooperation since 2007, with a new bilateral security framework. More than 300,000 people have been killed in Mexico since former President Felipe Calderón deployed the military in a stated war on drug trafficking in 2006. More than 100,000 others have disappeared. Security forces at all levels have a well-documented history of systemic human rights abuses.</p>
<p>In 2011, the U.S. and Mexico agreed to a <a href="https://mx.usembassy.gov/the-merida-initiative/">reorganization</a> of Mérida that <a href="https://mx.usembassy.gov/five-key-points-to-understanding-the-merida-initiative/">would</a> strengthen “law enforcement institutions, enhance criminal prosecutions and the rule of law, build public confidence in the justice sector, improve border security, promote greater respect for human rights, and prevent crime and violence.” The shift was seen among some close trackers of the U.S.-Mexico security relationship as a potential move away from the militarized drug war model that has fueled unprecedented levels of violence and instability in the country.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[2](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[2] -->
<p>The database complicates that picture. Significant chunks of Mérida spending have indeed gone to civil society programs in Mexico in the past decade, largely through the U.S. Agency for International Development and the State Department; however, the government’s own records show that the Pentagon has taken the opposite track since 2011, doubling down on tactical training while moving away from human rights instruction. While the database captures the language proficiency and technical training courses one might expect to find in a binational security partnership, it also features extensive records of recent and large-scale training operations involving U.S. personnel in Mexico, including dozens of “unit-level pre-deployment training” missions involving upward of 140 marines at a time, combat shooting courses, martial arts courses, airborne parachute courses, tactical driving courses, asset interdiction courses, aerial warfare courses, and more.</p>
<p>“The top-line story that everybody’s giving is, all the Mérida spending is going to justice reform and it’s not just about shooting the baddies anymore,” Lettieri said. “I would say what the Pentagon is doing is ‘here’s how you shoot the baddies.’”</p>
<p>The information in the database, first <a href="http://trainingdata.securityforcemonitor.org/state-department-data/training-data?training%3Acountry_iso_3166_1__exact=MEX&amp;_sort_desc=training%3Astart_date">organized</a> by <a href="https://securityforcemonitor.org/">Security Force Monitor</a>, a Columbia Law School project, shows that from 2007 to 2012, the U.S. provided tactical training to an average of 261 members of Mexican security forces annually. After 2012, that number jumped to 1,454. The Mexican marines were the primary beneficiary of the explosion in training, representing nearly 60 percent of the Pentagon’s students and receiving nearly half — $46.3 million — of the $101.2 million spent post-2011. From 2013 to 2019, while tactical training was surging, the Pentagon provided human rights training to just 27 students, only 12 of whom came from the Mexican military. Combined Pentagon and State Department funding on human rights training post-2012 came out to a mere $212,000.</p>

<p>Lettieri went into the project neither searching for nor expecting to find the post-2011 increase in tactical training, but as he continued to work with the data, the shift became clear. “When you look at it over time, it just jumps off the page that it’s tactical,” he said. It wasn’t just the marines, known in Mexico as SEMAR, receiving tactical training, he discovered. The army, known as SEDENA, also received extensive Pentagon support at the tactical level. The finding was significant because Washington has couched its embrace of the marines as allies in the drug war in Mexico in the perceived unreliability of the army as a trustworthy partner in matters of operational security and human rights. SEDENA has long been one of Mexico’s most powerful institutions; it has also been tied to many of the country’s worst state crimes, including the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2015/05/04/how-43-students-disappeared-in-mexico-part-1/">2014 disappearance of 43 college students</a> in the state of Guerrero.</p>
<p>The database provides just one glimpse into a much wider world of security exchanges between the U.S. and Mexico, Lettieri said, most of which is inaccessible to the public. It does not include, for example, information on the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2018/04/26/mexico-arms-trade-us-gun-sales/">enormous array of arms</a> Mexico purchases from the U.S. or <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/10/06/mexico-weapons-sale-biden-murder-kidnapping/">where those arms ultimately end up,</a> nor does it reveal anything about the <a href="https://insightcrime.org/news/united-states-special-operations-massacre-mexico/">extensive training and cooperation</a> that occurs between state and local law enforcement agencies on the two sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. Thanks to the joint State Department and Pentagon report on foreign military training that’s delivered to Congress each year, “we have some ability to understand this section of U.S. interaction with Mexico,” Lettier said. Still, he added, “There&#8217;s a whole bunch of stuff we don&#8217;t know very much about.”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s a key takeaway here,” he said. “There&#8217;s a whole bunch of money being spent, but we don&#8217;t have even this minimal kind of accountability.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Fourteen months have</u> passed since Amber Ortega, a 35-year-old member of the Hia Ced O’odham tribe, was arrested for blocking border wall construction that threatened a sacred desert oasis in southern Arizona. Ortega was taken into custody along with Nellie Jo David, another Hia Ced O’odham woman, at Quitobaquito Springs, a world-famous ecosystem on the southern edge of the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument that has been a center of cultural and spiritual tradition for the O’odham for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Under President Donald Trump, government contractors rumbled across Organ Pipe’s pristine desert habit in multi-ton vehicles, pumped hundreds of thousands of gallons of water from the aquifer that sustains the springs, and <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/02/27/border-wall-construction-organ-pipe-explosion/">blew apart</a> sections of a nearby burial ground with powerful explosives to make way for the wall. In September 2020, Ortega and David were praying at the springs when they encountered one of the construction crews. The pair sat on the crew’s vehicles and told them they were not welcome. Tactical teams of Border Patrol agents and park police were called in, and Ortega and David were arrested.</p>

<p>For a low-level misdemeanor usually handled with a trespassing ticket, the two women were strip-searched, shackled, and driven to a for-profit jail 130 miles away, where they were <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/09/16/indigenous-activists-border-wall-protest/">held incommunicado</a>, without access to a lawyer, for nearly 24 hours. Early on in her case, a court-appointed lawyer told Ortega that efforts to fight her charges, which carry a maximum six-month sentence, were likely to fail. Ortega is no longer working with the attorney. While she could understand where the lawyer was coming from, for her, not fighting was not an option.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[1] -->“We&#8217;ve had our rights and access to lands, to sacred sites, taken by the United States government, and this has been happening since colonization.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[1] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[1] -->
<p>“I wanted to move forward with it to bring awareness to the oppression that we as Native people, as O’odham, have endured. We have been denied our voice,” Ortega told The Intercept. “We&#8217;ve had our rights and access to lands, to sacred sites, taken by the United States government, and this has been happening since colonization.”</p>
<p>On Thursday, Ortega will enter a plea of not guilty in her case and make an argument to a Tucson court that the actions she was arrested for were rooted in deeply held spiritual beliefs. Ortega’s new lawyer, Tucson-based civil rights attorney Paul Gattone, believes they have strong case. “She is a young Native American woman who has strongly held beliefs, religious, and cultural beliefs — that’s why she was out there,” Gattone told The Intercept. “Because of those cultural and religious beliefs, she felt compelled to take action, and that’s what she did.”</p>
<p>The trial marks the first instance of the Biden administration continuing a Trump-era prosecution of a borderlands advocate in Arizona, and the second time in recent years in which an activist in the state has mounted a religious freedom defense in response to high-profile charges linked to the government’s border security apparatus. Humanitarian worker Scott Warren, whom the Trump administration accused of human smuggling for providing aid to migrants in the desert, made a<a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/11/23/scott-warren-verdict-immigration-border/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> successful religious freedom defense</a> against two attempted federal prosecutions in 2019. Brought by the National Park Service, Ortega’s case has the Department of Interior prosecuting Ortega for attempting to halt the very same construction that the agency’s own top official, and first Native American secretary, Deb Haaland, <a href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/937756927" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spoke out about</a> as a member of Congress.</p>
<p>Though President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/05/899266045/biden-would-end-border-wall-construction-but-wont-tear-down-trump-s-additions">vowed</a> that “there will not be another foot of wall” built under his administration, his record on Trump’s signature ambition has been mixed. In South Texas, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/05/1043458068/biden-promised-to-halt-building-trumps-border-wall-but-new-construction-has-begu">new sections of wall</a> are being built; in Arizona, the Justice Department is locked in a legal battle with the state attorney general, who argues that by halting wall construction in the state, the president is pursuing a project of “<a href="https://tucson.com/news/local/subscriber/feds-arizona-cant-sue-over-halt-to-border-wall-construction/article_bddcd8fe-17f6-11ec-8999-0f3c0d957907.html">population augmentation</a>” aimed at flooding the country with foreigners. In a recent Senate confirmation hearing, Biden’s pick for commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Tucson Police Chief Chris Magnus, said he would <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/10/19/biden-cbp-chris-magnus-trump-border/">support expanded wall construction</a> along some areas of the border. The Senate Finance Committee <a href="https://twitter.com/ellengilmer/status/1455892847681544197">will vote</a> on Magnus&#8217;s nomination today.</p>

<p>At the core of Ortega’s decision to fight the case is what she describes as a “scary spiritual battle” against cultural erasure. With the 1854 Gadsden Purchase and the drawing of the modern U.S.-Mexico divide, the O’odham, which means “people” and includes multiple tribes, saw their physical world cleaved in two. In more recent years, O’odham lands in southern Arizona have been made the site of an <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/08/25/border-patrol-israel-elbit-surveillance/">unprecedented explosion in border militarization</a>. While they contended with the ramped-up surveillance and law enforcement, the Hia Ced O’odham, the smallest of the O’odham tribes, waged a three-decade struggle to obtain formal recognition of their existence from the wider tribal system. Those efforts paid off in 2013, with Hia Ced O’odham <a href="https://indiancountrytoday.com/archive/extinct-no-more-hia-ced-oodham-officially-join-tohono-oodham-nation">officially joining</a> Tohono O’odham Nation, though Ortega contends that the federal government’s continued treatment of O’odham lands as a war zone in need of fortification represents another failure see the Hia Ced as a people.</p>
<p>For thousands of years, the rare Sonoran Desert aquifer that feeds Quitobaquito Springs has provided the only source of fresh water for hundreds of miles around, making it a vital source of life and refuge for plants, animals, and people in the region. To mix concrete for the wall and spray down the dirt roads used by Trump’s construction crews, government contractors tapped into the aquifer and withdrew hundreds of thousands of gallons of water. In July 2020, just two months before Ortega and David’s arrest, National Geographic <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/quitobaquito-springs-arizona-drying-up-border-wall">reported</a> that in a span of just a few months, the flow of water into the springs had dropped by 30 percent, leading to the lowest water level in more than a decade. It is doubtful that the oasis will ever fully recover.</p>
<p>“It’s been disturbing, but we need to speak on these things because it’s our voices and our people. It’s our unity that we’re fighting for,” Ortega said. “It’s not just me. I’m not going through this by myself. I’m going through this with my people. This is generational. This is the memory of our ancestors. It’s our history. It’s our way of life.”</p>

<p><u>The road to</u> this week’s trial has been immensely difficult for both Ortega and David. In interviews with The Intercept, the two women described how the traumatic events that accompanied their arrests stretched out for months. The arrest itself had already “felt like an extremely unsafe situation,” Ortega said. With armed men of the U.S. government asserting their authority over the land and the Native American women standing before them, the moment was fraught with dark historical overtones. In a video from the scene, Ortega could be heard imploring the agents to take their weapons away.</p>
<p>“This is something that we, as O&#8217;odham, we’re familiar with. They do these things,” Ortega said. “The bigger story is we&#8217;re a traumatized generation and have been living these traumas.”</p>

<p>During their detention at the Florence Correctional Center, a medium-security federal facility owned and operated by the private prison corporation CoreCivic, Ortega and David, 38, were initially housed in an area reserved for men, without being told what charges they were facing or how long they would be locked up. “It was like they wanted to make a show of us. They knew we were women,” Ortega said. “They walked us into a men&#8217;s area, led us into our own cage, surrounded by men, and when Nellie asked to use the restroom, he said, ‘Oh, you’re women.’ And so then he let us out.” CoreCivic denied the claim.</p>
<p>Once released, the pair was placed under the strict supervision of the pretrial services office of the District Court of Arizona. For their refusal to leave land that the O’odham have tread since before the United States existed, the government ordered the women to submit to at-will home inspections, repeated urine sample testing, and strict prohibitions on travel. If they failed to consent, the government could issue warrants for their arrest.</p>
<p>Early on, David said, she made a request to visit Puerto Peñasco, a Mexican city on the Sea of Cortez where her family members are from, to pray and collect her thoughts. “I really wanted to go to the ocean, near the Pinacates, and just pray there,” she said. “I felt like that would just do so much, because so much had been desecrated.” The government denied the request. According to David, the situation got worse from there. “This whole year they’ve treated my body as if it’s their property,” she said. “Like what we did made my body available to them 24/7, and I have not been OK with that.”</p>

<p>The restrictions on movement, the constant check-ins, the repeated demands for her urine, and the threat that any failure to comply would result in the total negation of her freedom have felt to David like a new and intensified extension of the border surveillance that has shaped so much of the modern O’odham experience. “We’ve lived our entire lives under this heavy surveillance,” she said. “They were using our trauma against us.” David left law school to manage the continual demands of the court, but it was not enough. The pressure from the case began to take a serious toll on her mental health, triggering painful memories and unsettling reflections on the historical relationship between Native American women and the U.S. government. “I definitely needed mental help,” David said. “I was talking to everybody I know about it.”</p>
<p>Early on, Ortega and David were told to expect to go to trial in a couple months. That didn’t happen. “That’s how they eventually wore me down,” David said. In June, she pleaded guilty to her charges stemming from the 2020 arrest. She was fined $200.</p>

<p>Ortega, who decided to press on, described being similarly scarred by her experience with the government’s pretrial surveillance apparatus. “I shake when I call them,” she said. “I know I’m not doing anything wrong, but I literally shake.”</p>
<p>In the past year, Ortega has been pulled over several times by various government agencies while running errands and visiting family on the O’odham reservation. She has no doubt that the encounters are related to her activism. The stops in her home village are particularly disturbing. “I grew up in the village,” Ortega said. “They know who I am.”</p>
<p>The pressure resulting from her case became so intense that Ortega, too, took a semester off school to cope. “There was a point where it felt like every single move, every single week, there they were in some way: on the phone requesting a home visit, a UA sample, an in-office visit,” she said. “There was one thing after another.”</p>
<p>Often, in video calls with her pretrial service officer, Ortega was ordered to provide a guided tour of her living space. She saw her ability to participate in tribal ceremonies strangled by the government’s intrusion of her day-to-day life. “It was like I needed to be at a job and prove it and clock in,” she said. With her trial approaching, the memories of her arrest and what the moment meant has lingered in Ortega’s mind. “The day I was arrested, it was a reminder of what has already been done,” she said. “The displacement. The removals. It was hurtful to go through that, to understand the history, and then to go through that.”</p>
<p>“Generational trauma exists, and it&#8217;s not OK,” Ortega said. “We’re good people. We’re humble people. We get angry too, though. And we get hurt.”</p>
<p><strong>Correction: Nov. 3, 2021, 1:54 p.m. ET<br />
</strong><em>An earlier version of this article incorrectly reported that Ortega will face a jury. The trial will be a bench trial, without a jury.</em></p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>A trial date</u> has been set in the high-profile prosecution of a former top-ranking Mexican federal police official once considered the United States’ leading ally in the war on drugs. Genaro García Luna, the former head of public security in Mexico who was arrested in 2019 on charges of cocaine trafficking, listened in from jail Wednesday as Judge Brian M. Cogan of the Eastern District of New York set a tentative October 24, 2022, date for the potentially historic trial.</p>
<p>Noting the complexity and sensitivity of the case, which would be roughly comparable to an FBI director accused of colluding with the mafia, Cogan set backup dates for early January 2023. Federal prosecutors have accused García Luna of accepting millions of dollars in bribes to allow Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera’s Sinaloa drug cartel to “operate with impunity in Mexico” for more than a decade, while at the same time working side by side with the most powerful officials in the U.S. national security and law enforcement apparatus. García Luna has denied the charges.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>Given García Luna’s extensive U.S. government connections, his trial has the potential to peel back the secrecy surrounding drug war cooperation at the highest levels of the U.S. and Mexican governments and upend commonly held misperceptions of the Mexican drug war as a simple two-sided struggle between drug traffickers and law enforcement alone.</p>
<p>Anticipating a two-month trial, government lawyers have compiled more than 1 million pages of documents related to the case and are currently working with the defense team and the court to navigate the volume of classified materials included in the evidence. García Luna’s defense attorney, César de Castro, told the court Wednesday that the document count does not include all of the audio that government investigators have turned over in the case.</p>
<p>“It is substantial,” de Castro said, though, he added, most of the audio material turned over thus far does not appear relevant to his client’s case. “The majority of the discovery that we have reviewed does not relate to Mr. García Luna but it’s still difficult to get through.”</p>

<p>The movement in the García Luna case comes at a particularly tumultuous time for the Drug Enforcement Administration, the nation’s lead agency prosecuting the drug war abroad. In August, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice released a blistering <a href="https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/reports/21-109.pdf">54-page audit</a> of the DEA’s support for foreign law enforcement units, including its Sensitive Investigative Units, or SIU — ostensibly elite vetted components entrusted with some of the agency’s most sensitive secrets. As head of public security, García Luna oversaw the Mexican Federal Police, which was home to the nation’s SIU during his tenure.</p>
<p>In Mexico, past cases of compromised SIU operations include the infamous <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/allende-zetas-cartel-massacre-and-the-us-dea">2011 Allende massacre</a>, in which an entire town was virtually wiped out by organized criminal groups operating under the eye of Mexican federal law enforcement and military units. In Honduras, a DEA-vetted and led police unit <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/01/06/a-mission-gone-wrong">killed four unarmed civilians</a> in 2012. Inspectors general for the State and Justice departments later <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2017/05/24/dea-lied-to-congress-about-deadly-raid-that-killed-four-hondurans-government-report-says/">found that the DEA lied</a> to Congress about the circumstances of the killings, according to a<a href="https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2017/o1702.pdf#page=1"> 424-page report</a> published in 2017.</p>
<p>“Despite serious incidents associated with these units, the DEA has not performed any program-level reviews or assessed its oversight structure to determine what systemic improvements may have been needed to mitigate the risk of similar incidents occurring in the future,” the OIG investigators found.</p>
<p>In response to the inspector general report, the DEA <a href="https://www.dea.gov/press-releases/2021/08/26/dea-announces-review-international-operations">announced</a> in late August that it was conducting “a comprehensive review” of its “international operations and foreign footprint.” Following the announcement, the Associated Press <a href="https://apnews.com/article/colombia-miami-extradition-arrests-2b33829d32178756e28b3b24057cefaa">reported</a> that U.S. authorities had extradited a Colombian SIU official on charges of selling law enforcement information to organized crime; the official, 37-year-old Juan Pablo Mosquera, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-drug-enforcement-administration-miami-colombia-arrests-ff84db6883a61efa28b4c6d2b6436059">pleaded guilty</a> to the charges earlier this month. Top DEA officials themselves have also faced charges of international drug trafficking and trading intelligence for money. Last September, veteran agent <a href="https://apnews.com/article/drug-trafficking-tampa-us-news-drug-cartels-fl-state-wire-a21319d00069562ec7a39242b67101d0">Jose I. Irizarry</a> pleaded guilty to 19 federal counts involving drug trafficking out of Colombia, including bank fraud, money laundering, and the sale of sensitive law enforcement information.</p>
<p>The García Luna case is by far the most significant of the various drug-warrior-as-drug-trafficker prosecutions before the Justice Department right now.</p>
<p class="p1"><!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[2](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A4%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="4"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[2] --></p>
<p>From his perch as head of Mexico’s federal police and later as public security chief for the entire country, García Luna<a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/01/26/mexico-drug-war-el-chapo-garcia-luna-trial/"> wielded unparalleled power</a> during a critical period in the mid-2000s, when former President Felipe Calderón declared a war on drug trafficking organizations and the U.S. government provided unprecedented levels of intelligence, security assistance, and funding to support the campaign. Depending on the extent to which sensitive materials might surface, a García Luna trial could provide rare, behind-the-scenes insight into a conflict that has cost more than 400,000 lives, absorbed billions of dollars in U.S.-government funding, and done little to curtail the illicit flow of drugs into the United States in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>Groomed for his role as drug war czar by U.S. officials, García Luna routinely met with top U.S. law enforcement and national security figures during the Bush and Obama administrations and was often painted as Washington’s most reliable ally in the war on organized crime. Those relationships could create a double-edged effect at trial. Damaging material regarding García Luna’s conduct may support the Justice Department’s claims, but it could also point back at the government working to prosecute him and may create an incentive for prosecutors to keep their case as tightly focused as possible.</p>
<p>Last week, the former head of Mexico’s SIU pleaded guilty to charges of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from cocaine traffickers linked to Guzmán Loera’s Sinaloa Cartel in exchange for information on law enforcement operations. “From 2003 to 2016, Reyes Arzate was a Mexican Federal Police Officer assigned to SIU,” the department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/former-mexican-federal-police-commander-pleads-guilty-drug-trafficking-conspiracy">said in a statement</a>. “In 2008, he was appointed SIU Commander, making him its highest-ranking officer and principal point of contact for information sharing between U.S. and Mexican law enforcement personnel assigned to the SIU.” The Azarte case was also heard in Judge Cogan’s courtroom, as was Guzmán Loera’s conviction in 2019. In court filings, attorneys for the Eastern District have described the three cases as “presumptively related.”</p>
<p>For a time, prosecutors out of the New York office were pursuing a fourth major drug trafficking case involving top-level Mexican security officials. In October 2020, the office <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Cienfuegos.Detention.Memo_.pdf">spearheaded</a> the arrest of former Mexican military general Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda at a Los Angeles airport, sparking an international incident that went on for several months.</p>
<p>The administration of Mexican President Andres López Obrador accused the DEA of fabricating evidence against the former general, and he was released in January. Mexican officials then <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-mexico-coronavirus-pandemic-mexico-city-drug-trafficking-3e0fca4b5296c26b6c9422f738a4fa6f">proceeded to publish hundreds of pages from the U.S. government’s investigation online</a>. Soon after, U.S. officials described the binational security relationship as “<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/exclusive-u-investigations-cartels-paralyzed-170821152.html">paralyzed</a>.” Earlier this month, top officials from both countries met to unveil a new framework of cooperation on matters of law enforcement and security.</p>
<p>Whether the DEA changes its ways in light of the García Luna case and others like it remains to be seen. As the Justice Department’s August audit noted: “The DEA has experienced various negative and highly publicized incidents involving these units, which highlight the importance of program safeguards and the reality of the risks associated with these partnerships. However, the DEA has not strategically or programmatically evaluated these incidents involving foreign law enforcement units to identify lessons learned and enhance oversight.”</p>

<p>Implemented over the objections of public health professionals in March 2020, Title 42’s lockdown of asylum processing at ports along the southern border has created a backlog in some of northern Mexico’s most dangerous cities, <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/04/21/asylum-seekers-violence-biden-title-42/">fueling a rise</a> in extortion, kidnapping, and violent assaults of migrants and asylum-seekers. Recently used to <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/09/21/biden-haiti-texas-del-rio-asylum/">expel</a> more than 7,000 Haitians in a matter of just two weeks, the rule is currently being challenged in the courts and has become a central area of concern for legal and human rights advocates. The Biden administration has repeatedly renewed the policy and said that it is not an immigration enforcement measure.</p>
<p>“It’s absolutely imperative we do everything possible to stop spread of Covid,&#8221; Magnus told lawmakers. “Title 42 is a CDC authority, and I think it helps with this.” Magnus later added that he would support vaccination of individuals who are permitted to enter the U.S., a move that would call the necessity of Title 42 into further question.</p>

<p>Though Magnus resisted repeated Republican entreaties to describe the border as a zone of “crisis,” he did say that he would support wall construction in some areas of the U.S.-Mexico divide. “There are some gaps where that could make sense,” he said. The police chief highlighted the importance of advanced technologies like drones and biometric data collection to bolster border security efforts. The Biden administration has halted some border wall contracts. Magnus declined to say whether he would seek to renew those specific contracts without first reviewing them.</p>
<p>The president tapped Magnus as his pick for CBP commissioner in April. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who chairs the Finance Committee, delayed the hearing as part of a demand that the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CBP, turn over documents related to the deployment of Border Patrol tactical teams to Portland, Oregon, during the George Floyd protests. Wyden permitted the hearing to proceed after Homeland Security released the documents and announced an internal review of its use-of-force policies last month.</p>
<p>If confirmed, Magnus would be the first Senate-confirmed commissioner of CBP since 2019. He would lead an agency that is home to more than 60,000 employees, including roughly 20,000 Border Patrol agents. He <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-welcome-patrol-how-some-border-agents-are-struggling-with-bidens-policy-shift-2021-05-14/">has faced strong pushback</a> from the Border Patrol’s ultra-right-wing union, which enjoyed <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/12/27/border-patrol-trump-biden-politics/">unprecedented policymaking power and influence</a> under President Donald Trump, as well as the nation’s broader network of border hawks and nativist think tanks.</p>
<p>Since beginning his career as a 911 dispatcher in Michigan, Magnus has earned a national reputation as a police reformer who carried Black Lives Matter signs at protests and wrote editorials criticizing Trump’s immigration policies. He faced sharp criticism last year, however, after the Tucson Sentinel <a href="http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/062220_tpd_death/man-died-during-april-tpd-call-cops-pushed-out-face-possible-criminal-charges/">broke the news</a> that his department covered up the April 2020 killing of 27-year-old Carlos Adrian Ingram-Lopez. At a press conference, Magnus made a surprise offer of resignation in the wake of the revelations. Tucson Mayor Regina Romero declined the offer.</p>
<p>Ingram-Lopez’s death and the events that followed were not discussed in Tuesday’s hearing, but Magnus did tout his commitment to transparency, telling lawmakers: “You will find that I have a long history of transparency and sharing things with the public whatever the outcome may be.”</p>
<p>The agency Magnus seeks to lead has faced many high-profile scandals in recent years, including the deaths of multiple migrants in CBP custody; <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/02/08/us-mexico-border-journalists-harassment/">the surveillance of border-based lawyers, journalists, and asylum advocates</a>; and the existence of an enormous, secret <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2019/07/05/border-patrol-facebook-group/">Border Patrol Facebook group</a> in which current and former agents joked about killing migrants and forcing female Democratic members of Congress to perform oral sex.</p>
<p>Though Tuesday’s hearing addressed none of those incidents, Magnus said he would seek improved training and recruitment measures to rein in bad behavior at CBP. Most if not all Republicans are expected to vote against the police chief’s confirmation, though Vice President Kamala Harris’s tie-breaking power in the Senate will render the lawmakers’ opposition moot.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Conditions in Haiti</u> are far too dangerous to receive the thousands of people the Biden administration has been sending there en masse, the former special envoy to the country told Congress on Thursday, adding that the removals could constitute a violation of international law.</p>
<p>In his first public comments since resigning in protest over the effort last month, Daniel Foote delivered a clear message. “Deportation back to Haiti is not the answer right now,” Foote <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?515199-1/us-special-envoy-briefs-lawmakers-haitian-migrants-us-border&amp;live=">told</a> members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in a briefing. “Haiti is too dangerous. Our own diplomats can’t leave our compounds in Port-Au-Prince without armed guard.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>A career foreign service officer, Foote sent a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21080523-foote_resignation_letter_092221">scathing letter</a> to Secretary of State Antony Blinken on September 22, reporting that he refused to be associated with the administration’s “inhumane, counterproductive decision” to rapidly expel thousands of Haitian migrants whom U.S. homeland security officials had corralled into a squalid camp in Del Rio, Texas. Images of Border Patrol agents on horseback chasing Black migrants had caused a national uproar in the days prior. In his testimony, Foote both explained the reasoning behind his resignation and his vision for what’s needed in Haiti now, which includes both U.S. training and aid for an elite anti-gang force and a willingness to allow Haitians to chart their own political destiny.</p>
<p class="p1"><!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A1%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="1"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[1] --></p>
<p>In the weeks since Foote’s resignation, the Biden administration has expelled more than 7,000 people, including children, to Haiti, marking one of the largest mass expulsion efforts in recent U.S. history. Despite the White House’s ostensible faith in his Haiti expertise, Foote said he was not consulted on the wisdom or risks associated with the mass removal campaign. “Nobody asked me about the deportations,” he said. “I found out about it on the news just like the rest of us.”</p>
<p>Using a <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/04/18/biden-border-patrol-asylum-title-42/">controversial public health order</a> known as Title 42 as the basis for the expulsions, the Department of Homeland Security has flown virtually all of those individuals to Haiti without an immigration hearing or interviews to determine whether expulsion could place them at risk of physical harm. As he searched for information, Foote concluded that the Biden administration planned to remove as many Haitians as possible without conducting those critical, and legally necessary, interviews. “That’s against international law,” he said. “It’s called refoulement.”</p>
<p>Implemented over the objections of public health professionals, Title 42 is the subject of ongoing federal litigation.</p>
<p>Foote recalled one of his colleagues at the State Department saying that the roughly 14,000 Haitians who had gathered under the bridge in Del Rio would be better off in Haiti than in Texas. Foote said nothing could be further from the truth. “The gangs run Port-au-Prince. It is in their control,” he said. “They are better equipped and better armed than the police.”</p>

<p><u>The Biden administration</u> appointed Foote as special envoy to Haiti on July 22, two weeks after the <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/07/26/colombian-mercenaries-haiti-jovenel-moise-assassination/">assassination of President Jovenel Moïse</a>. Foote’s <a href="https://www.state.gov/announcement-of-daniel-foote-as-special-envoy-for-haiti/">mandate</a> included engagement with “Haitian and international partners to facilitate long-term peace and stability and support efforts to hold free and fair presidential and legislative elections,” and coordination of U.S. federal agencies and officials to “support the Haitian people and Haiti’s democratic institutions” in the wake of the president’s killing.</p>
<p>“The security situation, the economic situation, the health situation are all grave in Haiti right now,” Foote told Congress. Between the assassination, a recent earthquake, and an ongoing pandemic, he added, “Haiti can’t support the people it has there right now. The last thing they need is desperate people without anything to their names because they just spent everything trying to get to the states coming back — there’s no safety net. It’s just a recipe for human tragedy.”</p>
<p>Foote told the lawmakers that the administration’s misguided approach on the border was matched by a misguided policy in Haiti itself. He made the same point in his resignation letter, when he criticized U.S. support for Acting Prime Minister Ariel Henry as the country’s next leader in possible upcoming elections. In recent weeks, Henry has been identified as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/14/world/americas/haiti-henry-moise-assassination.html">potential suspect</a> in the president’s assassination.</p>
<p>“It’s critical that civil society has a voice in this new government,” Foote said. “It’s not critical that Ariel Henry and his administration has a voice in this new government, so I hope that our administration will stop imposing Ariel Henry on the Haitian people.”</p>
<p>A veteran diplomatic operator in Latin America and the Caribbean, Foote was a top counternarcotics official in Colombia before rising to become deputy assistant secretary in the State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. For him, the Haiti assignment marked a return to a place and issues he had seen before: Foote served as deputy chief of mission in Port-au-Prince from 2011 to 2012. During his previous stint in the country, which came in the wake of the country’s devastating 2010 earthquake, Foote said he personally witnessed key decisions about the country’s future made in rooms filled only with Americans.</p>
<p>“I can say that we know how not to fix Haiti,” he said. “I believe we need Haitians in the room and Haitian-led solutions.”</p>
<p>The State Department quickly responded to Foote’s letter last month. Spokesperson Ned Price issued a statement telling reporters that “all proposals, including those led by Special Envoy Foote, were fully considered in a rigorous and transparent policy process,” adding that it was “unfortunate that, instead of participating in a solutions-oriented process, Special Envoy Foote has both resigned and mischaracterized the circumstances of his resignation.”</p>
<p>Hours later, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article254465253.html">told McClatchy</a> that her disagreements with Foote stemmed from the special envoy’s proposal to send U.S. troops into Haiti. “It just was a bad idea,” Sherman said.</p>
<p>Foote did not issue a response at the time, but in his comments before Congress he sketched out his proposed security plan for Haiti, which included providing U.S. training and lethal aid to a small but elite task force of Haitian national police “with several components, including commandos, communicators, intelligence, people with the prosecutors.” Despite Sherman’s reported objections to his proposals, Foote said the State Department’s narcotics and law enforcement wing “is moving ahead with the security part of the training.”</p>
<p>The former special envoy pointed to a program that involved the NYPD training for Haitian police as a model for success. “When I left in 2012, they were an adequate police force of 14,000 members, and over the past four years, five years, the police has become politicized and political appointees from deceased President Moïse have developed ties with the gangs.”</p>
<p>Still, Foote said he believed that a security training model could work, arguing that suppressing the violence in Haiti would look different than other parts of the world. The real challenge, he said, is what comes after.</p>
<p>“There needs to be some economic viability for these disadvantaged military-age males,” Foote said. “It’s not even like you have choice. You either join the gangs, or you don’t have any income.”</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>The Biden administration</u> is pressing forward with the sale of millions of dollars in weapons to specialized elements of the Mexican military despite growing concern from lawmakers over the recipients’ abhorrent human rights records.</p>
<p>If completed, Sig Sauer, a New Hampshire-based company, would sell more than $5 million worth of assault rifles and suppressors to Mexico’s navy and marines. Long considered by U.S. officials to be Washington’s most trustworthy ally in the war on drugs, the Mexican navy, particularly its elite marine special operations teams, has been linked to a string of kidnappings and extrajudicial killings in recent years.</p>
<p>Announced in July, the State Department’s approval of the sale came just months after 30 Mexican marines were arrested for orchestrating a wave of disappearances and murders in a case that has drawn international attention and condemnation. The U.S. government takes human rights into consideration in all cases involving the approval of gun sales to foreign security forces, the State Department said in an email to The Intercept. The department refused to say how those standards were applied in Sig Sauer’s sale to the Mexican navy specifically. Sig Sauer did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><div class="shortcode" data-shortcode="newsletter" data-campaign="" data-cta="" data-headline="" data-layout="" data-subhead=""></div><!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[0] -->
<p>The weapons deal is a touchpoint in a wider set of concerns raised by Democratic lawmakers in recent months surrounding oversight of the multimillion-dollar flow of U.S.-made guns to the Mexican military as the two countries embark on what both have described as a new era of security cooperation. “We have a number of substantive concerns with these transfers based on recent reporting and credible documentation of abuses,” a Democratic aide on the House Foreign Affairs Committee told The Intercept. “We are currently engaged with the State Department on such concerns.”</p>
<p>This week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Attorney General Merrick Garland, and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas will travel to Mexico City for a multiday “<a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-blinkens-travel-to-paris-and-mexico-city/">high-level security dialogue</a>” with their Mexican counterparts. In recent months, Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard has repeatedly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/29/mexico-merida-initiative-violence/">underscored</a> Mexico’s intention to overhaul its relationship with Washington by leaving behind a $3 billion security aid package known as the Mérida Initiative. Senior Biden administration officials have <a href="https://www.proceso.com.mx/reportajes/2021/9/14/narcotrafico-migracion-violencia-somos-parte-del-problema-juan-gonzalez-asesor-de-biden-271901.html">signaled support</a> for the idea.</p>
<p>The focus on the aid program, however, is somewhat misleading. Though Mérida did begin with an emphasis on sending military aid and equipment to Mexico in the mid-2000s, it has gone through various iterations since. Today, the program is more <a href="https://mx.usembassy.gov/the-merida-initiative/">focused</a> on reform of Mexico’s judicial system and other rule of law and civil society initiatives than on hard-edged drug war operations. The militarization of Mexico that Mérida came to symbolize, and the abuses that have come with it, is arguably better reflected in the lucrative private arming of problematic security forces resulting from weapons deals like the one President Joe Biden’s State Department approved this summer. As both governments’ pursuit of the Sig Sauer sale suggests, that pipeline of weaponry appears well entrenched.</p>
<p>The visit by Biden’s top Cabinet-level officials to Mexico City this week follows months of inquiries from Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy’s office concerning exactly how those deals work and whether the U.S. really knows where the weapons it is approving are going.</p>

<p>Last month, Leahy’s office sent Blinken <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21074044-letter-to-sec-blinken-follow-up-on-firearms-exports-to-mexico-final-003001">a letter</a>, co-signed by Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, and Dick Durbin of Illinois, linking the Sig Sauer sale to a broader pattern of U.S.-made weapons, including those manufactured by Sig Sauer, making their way to units credibly implicated in kidnappings and massacres. If the U.S. government cannot keep track of where the weapons exports that it is approving are ultimately headed, the senators argued, then those sales should stop.</p>
<p>The senators’ letter was based in part on Mexican military records that tie U.S.-made guns to specific and notorious cases of abuses by Mexican security forces. Those records were obtained through public records requests by John Lindsay-Poland, a researcher and analyst with Global Exchange, a nonprofit human rights organization that publishes reports on U.S. weapons exports to Mexico through its Stop U.S. Arms to Mexico initiative.

<p><u>Presented as Mexico’s</u> answer to the Navy SEALs, Mexico’s marines have much in common with their northern counterparts, including responsibility for their country’s most sensitive operations. With deep U.S. security connections, marine special forces have for years enjoyed an aura of untouchability in the face of grave human rights abuse allegations. Recently, however, that’s begun to change.</p>
<p>In April, 30 marines from across the country were <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/05/05/mexico-marines-arrested-kidnappings-485250">called to Mexico City</a> under the auspices of an unspecified mission. Once on the ground, the marines were arrested on kidnapping charges. In total, 257 marines were suspected in the abduction or murder of nearly 60 men, women, and children, including American citizens, over a matter of months in early 2018.</p>
<p>The arrests were largely due to the efforts of families of disappeared persons and local human rights advocates in the northern Mexican state of Tamaulipas, whose decision to speak up in one of the border’s most dangerous places came at great personal risk.</p>
<p>In the winter of 2017, an element of marines led by a commander who was said to have a “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/12/18/mexican-marines-kidnappings-forgotten-american-426495">direct line with the Pentagon’s military intelligence</a>” was sent to the Tamaulipan city of Nuevo Laredo, just across the border from Laredo, Texas, as part of an anti-cartel offensive. By the time the unit’s six-month deployment was through, nearly 50 people last seen in marine custody were gone — some turned up dead, and others were never seen again. The victims had no evident ties to organized crime and included two 14-year-old boys, whose bodies were later found half-buried in the desert.</p>
<p>The following spring, families of Nuevo Laredo’s disappeared blocked the international bridge into Texas, bringing <a href="https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/estados/ocasiona-caos-vial-manifestacion-en-puente-fronterizo">millions of dollars in trade</a> to a halt. With activists calling the marines out by name, the action drew the attention of Mexico’s biggest newsrooms. Bit by bit, the horrors of what had happened in Nuevo Laredo came to light, as families described loved ones taken away by heavily armed marines without explanation or answers as to where they had gone. The United Nations Human Rights Office in Mexico launched an investigation and by the end of the month had confirmed 21 disappearance cases. The office’s high commissioner <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=23157&amp;LangID=E">called on</a> Mexico to “take urgent steps to end a wave of disappearances in and around the city of Nuevo Laredo.”</p>
<p>Two years later, an investigation by the human rights office of the Mexican federal government <a href="https://apnews.com/article/criminal-investigations-mexico-latin-america-caribbean-texas-645ec03ebd8e20f54d4d6d250cfe28d7">concluded</a> that the marines had abducted 27 people in Nuevo Laredo — 12 of whom turned up dead — and perpetrated a series of “illegal searches and arbitrary detentions.” The commission has separately found evidence of <a href="https://www.justiceinitiative.org/litigation/claudia-medina-v-secretaria-de-marina-and-fiscalia-general-de-la-republica">widespread torture and sexual abuse</a> in cases involving individuals in marine custody. In July of this year, in the wake of the marines’ arrests in Mexico City, the navy offered a rare <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexican-navy-offers-rare-apology-over-missing-people-border-town-2021-07-13/">acknowledgment and apology for its crimes</a> in Tamaulipas.</p>
<p>In a country where 98 percent of violent crimes, including murders, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/11/08/justice-victims-violent-crime-mexico-is-rare-can-deaths-nine-mormons-change-that/">go unsolved</a> and security forces are routinely involved in some of the most heinous attacks, the fact that so many members of the military’s most elite teams were facing possible accountability marked a moment unlike anything in recent history.</p>

<p>It would have been all but impossible for State Department officials with an eye toward Mexico to miss one of the country’s biggest national security and human rights stories, one described in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/world/americas/mexico-missing-people-united-nations.html">New York Times</a>, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-44434406">BBC</a>, and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/un-says-mexicos-security-forces-likely-behind-disappearances-of-people-along-the-border/2018/05/30/3aaf9696-bc1f-48d8-820e-a50e12f87720_story.html">Washington Post</a>. Just last year, Politico Magazine published <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/12/18/mexican-marines-kidnappings-forgotten-american-426495">a deeply reported investigation</a> into the case of Jorge Antonio Dominguez, an 18-year-old U.S. citizen who was snatched off the street by marines in April 2018 and remains missing to this day. In the article, a former high-ranking official in the State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs described how closely the department monitors media reporting on issues like kidnapping.</p>
<p>And yet the State Department, in its <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21074040-state-department-july-2021-sig-sauer">July notification to Congress</a>, which came less than two weeks after the Mexican navy acknowledged responsibility for the Nuevo Laredo kidnappings, listed “human rights” among the issues it reviewed in approving the sale of millions of dollars in Sig Sauer weaponry to the navy.</p>
<p>The Intercept asked the State Department what criteria it used to arrive at its conclusion.</p>
<p>“Without speaking to individual cases, all proposed defense sales and transfers are assessed on their individual merits in accordance with the Arms Export Control Act, the U.S. Conventional Arms Transfer Policy and other related law and policy guidance which accounts for a broad range of political and economic considerations including human rights,” a State Department spokesperson said in an email.</p>
<p>The relationship between the State Department, Sig Sauer, and the Mexican navy — and by extension the Mexican marines — <a href="https://www.afsc.org/resource/fact-sheet-sig-sauer-arms-exports-to-mexico">long predates</a> the sale in question today and is in fact part of a multiyear exchange of guns and cash.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(cta)[4](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[4] -->
<p>In 2015, the State Department approved a license for Sig Sauer to export $265 million worth of assembly kits for semi-automatic pistols and submachine guns to the Mexican navy through 2024. By 2018, as human rights abuses by the marines began picking up coverage, $26.7 million in gun parts and $4.3 million in complete guns had already been exported through the deal.</p>
<p>“This means that Sig Sauer has at least $234 million left in sales to make before its license expires in 2024,” <a href="https://www.stopusarmstomexico.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/THE-LEGAL-AND-ILLEGAL-GUN-TRADE-TO-MEXICO_August2018.pdf">a report</a> published by Lindsay-Poland and colleagues at the Mexican Commission for the Defense and Promotion of Human Rights noted at the time. “If the license is completely fulfilled, the navy’s weapons purchases from Sig Sauer alone would nearly double the already elevated U.S. exports of guns and gun parts to Mexico.”</p>

<p><u>With hundreds of</u> millions of dollars in U.S.-made guns and gear on the line and repeated evidence of the recipients of that equipment engaging in murder and kidnapping, a handful of lawmakers are pushing for answers on the oversight of U.S. weapons to Mexico.</p>
<p>For decades, oversight of arms exports to foreign governments was the sole responsibility of the State Department. Under former President Donald Trump, elements of those responsibilities were <a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/blog/2019-03-26/abramson-testimony-proposed-small-arms-transfers">controversially shifted</a> to the Department of Commerce. Under the revised framework, State approves licenses and has responsibility for end-use controls for fully automatic firearms, while Commerce approves licenses and has responsibility for end-use controls for semi-automatic and nonautomatic firearms. The shift, which removed meaningful congressional oversight of the licensing process, marked the accomplishment of a long-standing goal of the arms industry.</p>
<p>In March, Leahy, Durbin, Merkley, and Booker sent Blinken <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21074041-letter-to-sec-blinken-on-firearms-exports-to-mexico-2-18-001">a letter</a> — co-signed by Sens. Robert Menendez, Ben Cardin, Chris Van Hollen, and Tim Kaine — seeking information on how the new oversight regime was playing out with respect to Mexico, the top government buyer of American guns in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>The senators cited several reasons for concern. The lawmakers pointed to documents from the Mexican Secretariat of National Defense, or SEDENA, showing that U.S.-made guns, many of them manufactured by Sig Sauer and then purchased by SEDENA, were sold to security forces implicated in massacres and extrajudicial killings going back years and extending into the present day.</p>
<p>In September 2019, members of a U.S.-trained Tamaulipas state police special operations unit known as the GOPES massacred eight civilians in Nuevo Laredo, the same border city where the marines had carried out their abductions a year before. In the two months that followed, “SEDENA sold hundreds of Sig Sauer rifles and pistols that it imported from the United States” to the public security office under which the GOPES are housed. The senators noted: “The sale to this unit proceeded even after the United Nations announced within two weeks of these killings that it was investigating them, and prior to a trial of three officers of the Tamaulipas SSP, which has not yet taken place as of the writing of this letter.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(promote-related-post)[6](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_RELATED_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22relatedPostNumber%22%3A1%7D) --><div class="promote-embed" data-related-post-number="1"></div><!-- END-BLOCK(promote-related-post)[6] -->
<p>Twelve more members of the GOPES were <a href="https://justiceinmexico.org/police-alleged-role-migrant-massacre/">arrested for another massacre</a> in March of this year, accused of murdering 19 migrants and incinerating their remains just south of the Texas border. “Online images posted by the Tamaulipas state government show GOPES agents with Sig Sauer rifles,” the senators wrote. Despite the trail of violence, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Drug Enforcement Administration officials in Mexico presented the commander of the GOPES with <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/08/10/mexico-ice-dea-massacre-police-award/">an award in August</a>, citing his “exceptional,” “outstanding,” and “continuous contributions” to joint U.S.-Mexico law enforcement efforts.</p>
<p>The military documents reviewed by the lawmakers also showed that U.S.-made guns were used in one of the most notorious crimes in Mexican history: <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2015/05/04/how-43-students-disappeared-in-mexico-part-1/">the 2014 disappearance by Mexican security forces of 43 students</a> from the rural teachers college known as Ayotzinapa, in the state of Guerrero. Recently, leaked testimony in the case has pointed to the Mexican army’s <a href="https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/leaked-testimony-links-military-with-disappearance-of-43-ayotzinapa-students/">direct involvement</a> in the students’ disappearance. From 2010 to 2016,<a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2018/04/26/mexico-arms-trade-us-gun-sales/"> nearly one-fifth</a> of guns purchased by the army and sold to police forces in Guerrero went missing or were stolen.</p>
<p>“The documents from SEDENA show that Colt Manufacturing was notified on February 3, 2015, that hundreds of rifles it produced were exported and destined for police forces in eight states,” the senators wrote, including the public security office in Guerrero. “That notification came only two months after public reports implicated the Guerrero SSP in the forced disappearance of 43 students in Iguala, Guerrero, on September 26, 2014. Judicial documents from the investigation of the Ayotzinapa disappearances show that municipal police in Guerrero implicated in the disappearances were armed with Colt rifles.”</p>

<p>Taken together, the documents pointed to a potentially systemic misrepresentation of where American guns are going in Mexico spanning more than a decade. The Mexican army provided hundreds of end-use certificates for “U.S. exported firearms destined for state and local police forces between 2008 and 2019,” the senators wrote. “Although the firearms were exported for use by police forces, in every single certificate, SEDENA listed itself — the army — as the end user.”</p>
<p>Given the alarming picture emerging from the military’s own records, the lawmakers asked whether the government tracked U.S.-made weapons that the Mexican army sells to police units; whether embassy officials were aware of the sales to Mexican security forces accused of killings and abductions in Guerrero and Tamaulipas; and how oversight of arms exports would function with the recent transfer of responsibilities to the Department of Commerce.</p>
<p>The State Department, in its <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21074043-h20210315-001_leahy">reply</a> the following month, delivered just one week after the marines were taken into custody in Mexico City, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21074042-h20210315-001-enclosure">indicated</a> that its ability to track weapons once they are sold to the Mexican military is limited and deferred to the Commerce Department on matters of oversight going forward. As for whether U.S. officials were “aware that U.S. firearms were sold for use by police forces in Guerrero and Tamaulipas,” the department did not provide a direct answer, instead listing its general policies.</p>
<p>The lawmakers were not satisfied. “We remain concerned to learn from your response that the U.S. Embassy has not been consulted about instances regarding Mexican police forces as end users of U.S. exported firearms,” they wrote in a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21074044-letter-to-sec-blinken-follow-up-on-firearms-exports-to-mexico-final-003001">follow-up letter</a> last month. “We are also concerned about a proposed license to export $5.5 million worth of Sig Sauer automatic rifles to the Mexican Navy, whose units are implicated in forced disappearances and torture, without adequate end user controls.” The senators pointed to a 2019 report which found that more than 65 percent of “detainees over a ten-year period said that they suffered torture while in Navy custody, including asphyxia, electric shocks, burns, and rape.”</p>
<p>The lawmakers called on Blinken to “immediately begin a review of all existing licenses for exports of firearms to Mexico for use by the Mexican police and Navy” before and since March 2020. They also called for a suspension of licenses in cases in which end users appeared in a government database known as INVEST, which the State Department uses to monitor abuses by security units that receive U.S. training.</p>
<p>“Given the extensive documentation of widespread infiltration of Mexican police forces by criminal organizations, and police and military participation in atrocities, we expected the Departments of State and Commerce to establish mechanisms to ensure that U.S. firearms do not contribute to these crimes,” they wrote. Instead, they said, “the Commerce Department issued a rule change in December 2020, without public comment, that <em>eases </em>firearms exports to Mexico.”</p>
<p>As for guns going to problem units in Guerrero and Tamaulipas, the senators wrote that the State Department’s April response “clarified how licenses for firearms exports to Mexico should identify end users, but did not state whether this was the case for the firearms transferred in 2015 to state police in Guerrero and in 2019 to state police in Tamaulipas.”</p>
<p>The lawmakers demanded to know: “When were U.S. Embassy staff or other U.S. officials first aware that U.S. firearms were sold for use by police forces in Guerrero and Tamaulipas? What actions were taken, if any, to prevent further U.S.-exported firearms from ending up in the hands of these police forces? If no action was taken, why not? We asked these questions in our March letter, and ask them again.”</p>
<p>The senators have yet to receive answers to their questions, a spokesperson for Leahy’s office said in an email to The Intercept, though, he added, their inquiry continues.</p>

                                        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>Less than a</u> year after entering office with vows to bring a new humanitarian approach to the nation’s immigration system, the Biden administration is carrying out what could be the largest mass expulsion of would-be asylum-seekers in recent American history. Virtually none of those being removed from the country — nearly all of whom are Black — have received their day in court, nor will they under the administration’s current plan.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the expelled, including families and children, will be flown to Haiti, a country the administration itself <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/08/03/2021-16481/designation-of-haiti-for-temporary-protected-status">characterized</a> as a state teetering on the brink of collapse last month. With expulsions already underway and expected to intensify in the coming days, advocates are bracing for an already horrifying human rights nightmare to become far more dangerous.</p>
<p>“I can’t think of a worse way of handling the situation,” Nicole Phillips, legal director at Haitian Bridge Alliance, a San Diego-based nonprofit, told The Intercept. In recent weeks, upward of 14,000 men, women, and children, the vast majority of them Haitian nationals, began gathering under a bridge in the Texas border town of Del Rio. Over the weekend, Border Patrol agents on horseback <a href="https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/immigration/2021/09/19/haitian-migrants-tough-choices-crackdown-del-rio-texas-border/8411152002/">descended on the crowd</a>, swinging their reins like whips, charging at people carrying bags of food, shouting at them to go back to Mexico, and pushing them into the swift waters of the Rio Grande.</p>

<p>“The situation in Del Rio is a humanitarian crisis that was avoidable,” Phillips said. For the past five years, advocacy groups like hers have been warning both the Trump and Biden administrations that a combined lack of viable asylum access at U.S. ports and a deteriorating situation in Haiti was a recipe for disaster. “They ignored us and continued to block our ports of entry to Haitian asylum-seekers.”</p>

<p>On Monday, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas visited Del Rio to receive an “operational update” from local and federal authorities. “This is not the way to come to the United States,” Mayorkas <a href="https://www.pahomepage.com/news/national-news/live-blog-border-patrol-chief-no-one-has-crossed-since-midnight-into-del-rio-texas/">told</a> reporters. The secretary reported that 600 federal officials, from Border Patrol agents to Coast Guard personnel, are now aiding in a massive effort to expel the Haitians and any other foreign nationals who might be with them. Local officials in Del Rio declared a state of emergency Friday, while Customs and Border Protection closed the Del Rio International Bridge into Mexico’s Ciudad Acuña.</p>
<p>With 6,000 migrants already moved out of the Del Rio camp, Mayorkas said DHS is seeking additional assistance from the Pentagon to ramp up the operations even further.</p>

<p>The sweeping expulsion campaign has left officials in Haiti scrambling and those caught up in the effort confused, horrified, and devastated.</p>
<p>“The Haitian state is not really able to receive these deportees,” Jean Negot Bonheur Delva, the head of Haiti’s immigration office, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/19/world/americas/us-haitian-deportation.html/">said</a> as the first of the expulsion flights, which included babies and small children, touched down in Port-au-Prince on Sunday. Six more flights are scheduled for today and seven more for Wednesday. Haitian officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/19/world/americas/us-haitian-deportation.html/">told</a> the New York Times they are anticipating six flights a day for the next three weeks. “Only once since 2014 has the United States deported more than 1,000 people to the country,” the paper reported. On Sunday, Border Patrol Chief Raul L. Ortiz said that his agency was “working around the clock” to expel the people who remained — about 12,600 at the time — in the next week.</p>
<p>“Nobody told us we were going back to Haiti,” Sonia Piard, a 43-year-old mother of three whose family was part of the first wave of expulsions, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/09/19/haiti-deportee-flight-port-au-prince/">told</a> the Washington Post, adding that it felt as though they had been “kidnapped to be sent back to Haiti.”</p>
<p>Once on the ground in Haiti, the expelled families and individuals will find themselves in a country utterly devoid of resources and infrastructure to receive them. “When Haitians are arriving, they haven&#8217;t been fed, they haven&#8217;t been given water, they haven&#8217;t showered, they haven&#8217;t slept, and they’re terrified — they didn&#8217;t even know they’re going to be deported. Many have been away from the country for years,” Phillips said. Often, people arrive without cellphones, she noted. Haitian immigration processing policy requires that no arrivals leave their initial processing center without being picked up by a loved one or family member. Without phones or a warning that they are being expelled to the country that they fled, huge numbers of Haitians could find themselves stuck in a space designed to process dozens of people at the absolute most.</p>
<p>“They’re not able to handle hundreds, if not thousands, of people. There just isn&#8217;t the infrastructure in place,” Phillips said. “Not only is there not the administrative support for this, there&#8217;s also not the infrastructure to even receive them physically if their family members cannot come to pick them up, which is likely.”</p>

<p>The reasons so many Haitians ended up in Del Rio are rooted in a continuum of U.S. policy decisions. Since 2016, DHS has deployed a series of policies and strategies that have vastly diminished the potential for families or individuals to seek asylum at the nation’s ports. Under the most sweeping of those policies, known as Title 42, DHS has summarily expelled border-crossing individuals from the country without a hearing, regardless of whether they are seeking asylum — a right enshrined under domestic and international law — and without establishing whether being returned to their country of origin poses a risk to their safety. Ostensibly a public health statute, Title 42 was pushed through by Trump immigration advisor Stephen Miller <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cdc-officials-objected-to-order-turning-away-migrants-at-border-11601733601">over the objections</a> of career public health professionals in March of 2020.</p>
<p>Last week, a federal judge <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/16/biden-title-42-blocked-asylum-512271">ruled</a> that the order does not grant the government the authority to carry out the expulsions. The Biden administration has appealed the ruling. DHS continues to use Title 42 as a basis in its mass expulsion operations. Despite the department’s stated concern for preventing the spread of Covid-19, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/u-s-will-prioritize-single-adult-haitians-some-families-deportation-n1279548">sources told NBC News</a> that in an effort to carry out expulsions as quickly as possible, U.S. officials will not be testing migrants for the virus before sending them to Haiti. Fallout from last month’s earthquake has significantly hampered Haiti’s vaccination efforts — as of last week, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article254269418.html">less than 1 percent</a> of the country’s 11.5 million people had received the vaccine.</p>
<p>Lack of asylum access at the ports has fueled a backlog of asylum-seekers, in particular Haitians, in border cities across northern Mexico, where organized crime and collaborators in Mexican security forces routinely prey on migrants. Haitians, who stand out because of language and skin color, are particularly vulnerable. A report published last month by Human Rights First catalogued <a href="https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/sites/default/files/AttacksonAsylumSeekersStrandedinMexicoDuringBidenAdministration.8.23.2021.pdf">6,356</a> reports of violent attacks — including rape, kidnapping, and assault — against people blocked from asylum access or expelled to Mexico in the first seven months of the Biden administration. The organization found that nearly 1 in 5 Haitian asylum-seekers were victims of police abuse in northern Mexico.</p>
<p>Phillips said that nearly every Haitian asylum-seeker she has spoken to on the border, from Tijuana to Matamoros, had experienced some form of violence, including anti-Black hate crimes and extortion.</p>

<p>The issue of physical safety is key to understanding the buildup in Del Rio. Contrary to popular misunderstandings, seeking asylum in the U.S. between ports is legal. While crossing the border itself without authorization is a federal misdemeanor, the low-level charge does not bar an individual from receiving asylum down the line. The resulting dynamic is one in which U.S. policy has both escalated the danger for individuals hoping to exercise their right to seek asylum on U.S. soil and incentivized doing so between ports of entry as a matter of last resort.</p>
<p>With asylum access at ports effectively dead, predatory criminal groups and cops stalking Mexico, and return home out of the question, it should come as no surprise that asylum-seekers seek alternative locations where they can ask for refuge. In recent weeks, word spread that Ciudad Acuña was one of those places, Phillips said. People who had spent months hiding out in Mexico, or who had been forced out of countries in South America and tried their luck in the Darién Gap, a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/rapes-of-u-s-bound-migrants-make-a-treacherous-route-even-more-dangerous-11630956539">notoriously treacherous</a> stretch of Panamanian jungle where rape and robbery are common, heard there was a chance.</p>
<p>“It’s unclear how these rumors started,” Phillips said, but what is clear is that most of the Haitians who ended up in Texas are not recent departures from their country of origin — in fact, many have been trying for months or years to make a case in the U.S. Some came from states in southern Mexico, where immigration authorities, carrying out a U.S.-supported anti-migration initiative, last month <a href="https://www.borderreport.com/hot-topics/immigration/mexican-officials-break-up-another-migrant-caravan-near-southern-border/">attacked caravans of migrants</a> headed north.</p>
<p>“The whole thing of ‘Why don&#8217;t they just come in legally?’” Phillips said, “they have been trying for years, and they have not been allowed to legally enter.”</p>

<p><u>The speed and</u> scale of the Biden administration’s new expulsion effort is without comparison in the 21st century, said Yael Schacher, an immigration historian and senior U.S. advocate at Refugees International. At the same time, she added, the government’s targeting of Haitians as a group has a long, dark history in the annals of U.S. immigration enforcement.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, the Reagan administration pioneered the interdiction of migrants at sea through a sweeping crackdown on Haitian asylum-seekers. While most were promptly turned back, the rest were typically transferred to a Dade County detention center, today known as Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Krome Detention Center. The mass housing of migrants signaled that the administration had overcome fears, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/07/19/how-migrant-detention-became-american-policy/">articulated</a> by then-Deputy Attorney General Rudy Giuliani, that doing so “could create an appearance of ‘concentration camps’ filled largely by blacks.”</p>
<p>“Haitians have been the group that’s been the first target of what later becomes the sort of harsh treatment of asylum-seekers and immigrants,” Schacher told The Intercept. “The way we detain immigrants really started under Reagan, and it targeted first Haitians.”</p>
<p>Haitians were again used as guinea pigs for new get-tough immigration enforcement measures under the administration of President George H.W. Bush, which launched a policy of interdictions and forced returns without hearings, much like the Biden administration is pursuing today. “It was first applied to the Haitians, and then it was deemed legal for everybody,” Schacher said. In a precursor to his son’s turn in the White House, Bush <a href="https://gitmomemory.org/timeline/haitians-and-gtmo/">detained tens of thousands</a> of Haitians at the U.S. military’s base in Guantánamo Bay.</p>

<p>Last month, Schacher visited Texas and interviewed Haitians who had traveled through the Darién Gap and passed through Del Rio. What worries her now, she said, is the administration’s “sudden use and targeting of a specific group for this kind of expulsion.” Unlike Reagan and Bush’s interdictions at sea, the Haitians being expelled today have made it onto U.S. soil, Schacher noted. The Biden administration’s current program is thus more reminiscent of “<a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/11/11/9714842/operation-wetback">Operation Wetback</a>,” she argued, a notorious, militarized, and highly publicized enforcement campaign that was used to deport Mexicans en masse in the 1950s. It was, in Schacher’s words, “a stellar blitz where you’re trying to send a message.”</p>
<p>On the campaign trail, then-presidential candidate Joe Biden often tied his vision of immigration to U.S. history, arguing that President Donald Trump had “waged an unrelenting assault on our values and our history as a nation of immigrants.”</p>
<p>“It’s wrong, and it stops when Joe Biden is elected president,” the Biden team <a href="https://joebiden.com/immigration/">said</a> in launching its immigration platform. “Unless your ancestors were native to these shores, or forcibly enslaved and brought here as part of our original sin as a nation, most Americans can trace their family history back to a choice — a choice to leave behind everything that was familiar in search of new opportunities and a new life.”</p>

<p>Last weekend’s images of lawmen on horseback chasing Black people seeking a new life through the Texas brush conjured other visions of the nation’s past. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTFnKJqcPks">one video</a>, captured by an Al Jazeera film crew, a mounted Border Patrol agent is seen telling Haitian migrants, “This is why your country’s shit, because you use your women for this!” before directing his rearing horse toward a group of children. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., chair of the Committee on Homeland Security, called the images “horrific and disturbing” in a statement Monday. DHS later announced the beginning of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/border-haitians-horses-agents/2021/09/20/c489c3ae-1a41-11ec-914a-99d701398e5a_story.html">formal inquiries</a> into the conduct of agents on the ground in Del Rio.</p>
<p>The Biden administration’s response to Haitians on the border is not just unconscionable, Phillips argued, it’s also contradictory. In May, Mayorkas <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/05/22/secretary-mayorkas-designates-haiti-temporary-protected-status-18-months">announced</a> a new 18-month designation of temporary protected status for Haitian nationals in the U.S., offering an avenue for protection from deportation on the grounds that Haiti is “currently experiencing serious security concerns, social unrest, an increase in human rights abuses, crippling poverty, and lack of basic resources, which are exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.”</p>
<p>Last month, DHS extended that protection to Haitians who had made it onto U.S. soil prior to July 29. In <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/08/03/2021-16481/designation-of-haiti-for-temporary-protected-status">a notice</a> filed in the federal register on August 3, department officials noted that Haiti is currently “grappling with a deteriorating political crisis, violence, and a staggering increase in human rights abuses.”</p>
<p>Those conditions have not evaporated in the weeks since the notice was filed, Phillips noted, and yet the White House and DHS are proceeding as if they have. For her, and for many others, the conclusion is crystal clear. “Our immigration system still has anti-Black racism that is fueling this Biden administration&#8217;s response to this Haitian migration problem,” Phillips said. “This is anti-Black racism in our immigration policy. Period.”</p>

Bush stood before Congress and delivered one of the most consequential speeches in modern history, outlining for the country and the world the shape his administration’s new “war on terror” would take. There would be no quarter for America’s enemies, Bush vowed, and the campaign would be waged at home as well as abroad.</p>
<p>“Our nation has been put on notice: We are not immune from attack,” the president said. To address this vulnerability, Bush announced the creation of a new Office of Homeland Security, which would oversee “a comprehensive national strategy to safeguard our country against terrorism and respond to any attacks that may come.” Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, a Republican, Vietnam combat veteran, and friend of the president’s, would lead the effort. “These measures are essential,” Bush said. “The only way to defeat terrorism as a threat to our way of life is to stop it, eliminate it, and destroy it where it grows.”</p>
<p>Just over a year later, on November 25, 2002, Bush <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?174002-1/homeland-security-act-signing">signed</a> the Homeland Security Act, paving the way for the largest restructuring of the U.S. national security state since the creation of the CIA and the Department of Defense a half-century earlier.</p>

<p>With the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, a megabureaucracy comprised of 22 federal agencies, Bush’s once compassionate descriptions of life on the southern border gave way to a narrative of unending existential threat. Just six days before 9/11, Bush had stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Mexican President Vicente Fox on the South Lawn of the White House to herald a new era of sweeping immigration reform. “I want to remind people: Fearful people build walls. Confident people tear them down,” he said. By the time he signed the landmark homeland security legislation 14 months later, Bush was telling reporters and lawmakers that “the front of the new war is here in America.”</p>
<p>Two decades after 9/11, the birth of DHS stands out as the most significant domestic consequence of the war on terror, having taken the intensity, scope, and funding of U.S. border and immigration enforcement to heights previously unseen in the nation’s history.</p>

<p>Through the department’s two largest components — Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which receive more federal funding than the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Secret Service, the U.S. Marshals, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/10/border-patrol-the-green-monster-112220/">combined</a> — the U.S. has become <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/09/24/detained">the world’s leading jailer of immigrants</a>. Most of those individuals are held in a network of for-profit jails that exploded in profitability following the attacks. Across the Southwest, pressure to increase DHS enforcement reshaped the federal court system, with daily mass prosecutions of migrants and other low level immigration offenses consistently consuming <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/tracreports/crim/446/">more of the federal docket than any other crime</a> for much of the past two decades.</p>

<p>Since 2001, the binational border communities that Bush once celebrated have been cut off by taller and taller walls and the planet’s most sophisticated border surveillance apparatus. In the past two decades, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/border-crisis-arizona-sonoran-desert-882613/">at least 9,000 migrants</a> pushed by this apparatus into the country’s deadliest terrain have died. While <a href="https://www.tni.org/en/bidensborder">lining the pockets of defense contractors</a> north of the international divide, the militarization has transformed unauthorized border crossing into a massive black market, attracting organized crime, corrupt U.S. agents, and <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/08/10/mexico-ice-dea-massacre-police-award/">abusive Mexican security forces</a> who <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/06/07/biden-harris-mexico-border-violence/">target migrants as disposable commodities</a> through systematic kidnapping and extortion.</p>
<p>Under President Donald Trump, public questioning of DHS, including whether it should continue to exist, became common. <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/11/01/el-paso-family-separation-border-patrol/">Family separations</a> at the border, <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/07/25/portland-federal-agents-antifa-border/">Border Patrol special operations teams in Portland</a>, reports of <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/09/12/homeland-security-whistleblower-corruption/">intelligence tampering at the highest levels</a> of the department — the scandals and reports of abuse were unending. By the summer of 2020, sitting lawmakers were <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/07/25/barbara-boxer-regret-dhs/">expressing regret</a> for having ever voted for the creation of the department. Top Bush and Obama-era national security officials have since called for a <a href="https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/reforming-the-department-of-homeland-security-through-enhanced-oversight-accountability">serious retooling</a> of the department. Others have called for its <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/replacing-department-homeland-security-something-better">full dismantlement</a>.</p>
<p>Michael Chertoff, the second secretary of DHS, oversaw the department in the formative years of 2005 to 2009, presiding over a historic expansion of the Border Patrol and the construction of hundreds of miles of border wall. He rejects the notion that the actions the government took post-9/11 qualify as militarization.</p>

<p>“The truth is, the border was not well patrolled,” Chertoff told The Intercept. “I don’t think we militarized it.” By incorporating radars and sensors, DHS was aiming to “build more technical capability,” he said. “We did build some barriers, but we did not intend to build barriers across 2,000 miles,” Chertoff said. “The idea was to simply make it possible to deter and intercept illegal cross-border smuggling and that’s part of what your responsibility is — not just because of terrorism, but just in general. You’ve got to be able to control your borders.”</p>
<p>Erika Andiola sees that history differently. For her, the creation of DHS was about something deeper. Today, Andiola is chief advocacy officer at the Texas-based Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, or RAICES, but in 1998, she was an 11-year-old girl from Mexico crossing the border with her mother to escape an abusive father. In 2013, Andiola’s mother and brother were arrested by ICE in Phoenix. By that point, Andiola was already a nationally known undocumented activist. An online outcry spared her family members from deportation. Andiola has been fighting for the creation of a humane immigration system ever since.</p>

<p>Last year, Andiola and RAICES produced a <a href="https://www.raicestexas.org/arts-and-culture/homeland-insecurity/">podcast series</a> examining the creation and legacy of DHS. Throughout the series, Andiola makes the case that the post-9/11 collapsing of immigration into national security radically altered the quality of life for immigrants and undocumented people in the U.S. — and not for the better.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t just the actual policies and the funding and creation of these agencies, it was also how the framing of immigration started changing,” Andiola told The Intercept. “The entire narrative just became that we were the threat — we were the actual enemy of the nation.”</p>

<h3>Think Big</h3>
<p>In the early days, a minor mystery surrounded the origins of DHS: How exactly did the Bush administration settle on the name?</p>
<p>“Etymology unknown, don’t have a clue,” Ridge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/31/us/washington-talk-prickly-roots-of-homeland-security.html">told</a> the New York Times in 2002. The name, with its linguistic ties to authoritarian regimes from the Nazis to Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, was controversial. “The word ‘homeland’ is a strange word,” then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld observed in <a href="https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/donald-rumsfeld-apparently-didnt-want-to-use-the-word-homeland-when-naming-the-department-of-homeland-security/">a February 2001</a> memo. “‘Homeland’ Defense sounds more German than American. Also, it smacks of isolationism, which I am uncomfortable with. Third, what we are really talking about, I suppose, is ‘population’ as opposed to ‘homeland.’ Let’s visit about this.”</p>
<p>Concerns about the word “homeland” would continue to crop up <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/magazine/the-dark-history-of-defending-the-homeland.html">again</a> and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-dhs-was-destined-to-become-a-secret-police-force">again</a> in the coming years. The Times, in the same article that quoted Ridge, reported that the administration borrowed the term from a 1997 Pentagon report. Ridge, who suffered a stroke in July, declined through a spokesperson to be interviewed for this story. One of his top deputies at the time, James Loy, said the paper’s reporting was accurate.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(acast)[7](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22ACAST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Afalse%7D)(%7B%22id%22%3A%22alegacyofcorruptionandabuse-thepost-9-11immigrationmegabureaucracy%22%2C%22podcast%22%3A%22intercepted-with-jeremy-scahill%22%2C%22subscribe%22%3Atrue%7D) --><!-- END-BLOCK(acast)[7] -->
<p>The use of “homeland” was “a clear reference to the already existing homeland defense staff inside the Pentagon,” Loy told The Intercept. For Loy, who was commandant of the Coast Guard on September 11 and later served as deputy secretary of DHS, the move from homeland defense to homeland security was the “very logical extrapolation of what it was determined the nation needed in the aftermath of the attacks on 9/11.” In his view, the U.S. had suffered an invasion by nonstate actors, specifically foreigners who had breached its perimeters. “This was something that happened to us on our turf,” Loy said. “In my estimation and in the estimation of many, many, many others, the designed effort to build a construct known as the Department of Homeland Security was exactly what this country needed in the aftermath of 9/11 because of the unique nature of that attack.”</p>
<p>Getting there was not easy. Though Ridge was a well-liked Republican figure — “This is a guy that left law school, left Harvard Law School, so as to be able to sign up as a sergeant in the Army in Vietnam,” Loy said — the Bush administration had long resisted calls to stand up a whole new department, let alone one of the size that DHS would become.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2001, former Sens. Gary Hart and Warren B. Rudman had released a report on the nation’s state of preparedness in the face of a national catastrophe, including a terror attack. The report found that the federal government’s capacities were “fragmented and inadequate.” Though he did order a “national preparedness review,” Vice President Dick Cheney opposed the creation of a new department in response to the findings on the grounds that it was “a big-government mistake,” aides <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2005/12/22/departments-mission-was-undermined-from-start/df1251f0-c7f7-442c-b71a-92a57a2351f0/">told</a> the Washington Post. Ridge was facing an uphill battle.</p>
<p>Multiple factors influenced the administration’s eventual change of heart. For one, Sen. Joe Lieberman, a Democrat, was moving forward with proposed legislation to create a homeland-focused department. “While many Republicans were leery about a vast new bureaucracy, they did not want to cede the homeland security issue to the Democrats,” the Post reported. In April 2002, White House chief of staff Andrew Card called together a small group of mid-level staffers to explore options for addressing concerns that the nation’s domestic security apparatus was riddled with vulnerabilities. The group became known as the &#8220;Gang of Five.&#8221; Mark Everson, then a deputy director at the Office of Management and Budget, was one of the members.</p>

<p>Everson, who later headed the IRS and <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/2016/06/28/why-cannot-support-trump/86453032/">ran against Trump on the 2016 Republican ticket</a>, had served as deputy commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, or INS, in the 1980s, overseeing the implementation of President Ronald Reagan’s landmark 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act. He recalled his boss at OMB, Mitch Daniels, giving him three instructions before joining Card’s select team: “Think big, do what’s right, and don’t worry about the politics.” Beyond that, the gang was on its own. They poured over the Hart-Rudman Commission and past studies on military homeland defense. “We looked at all of the existing proposals,” Everson told The Intercept. “There were never instructions to achieve a particular outcome.”</p>
<p>The gang met on a nearly daily basis and regularly presented their progress to a tightly controlled group of senior administration officials in the Presidential Emergency Operations Center, the same nuclear-proof bunker under the East Wing of the White House where Cheney sheltered during 9/11. The work was highly secretive. “People were brought into the office on a need-to-know basis,” Everson recalled. After six weeks, they completed their proposal. “The remarkable thing about this in the context of Washington is the president didn’t announce the proposal until June 6, and I remember that morning turning on the radio and there was no leak of it,” Everson said. Not even Bush’s Cabinet secretaries saw it coming.</p>
<p>Nearly two dozen agencies, from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to the Secret Service, were folded into the new department. The biggest changes were in the border and immigration agencies, which became Everson’s responsibility. INS was axed entirely. Customs, previously under the Treasury Department, was attached to the Border Patrol to form CBP, while an entirely new agency, ICE, was created to carry out immigration enforcement and criminal investigations with a nexus to the border.</p>

<p>The last time the U.S. government had done something as big as the creation of DHS, it was coming out of a world war. Forty years later, in the mid-1980s, Congress was still fine-tuning the results through legislation restructuring the Pentagon. Everson and his colleagues expected a similar, multidecade tweaking process for DHS. “There were no illusions amongst the five of us that this was going to be a perfect Swiss watch right from the get-go,” he said.</p>
<p>Looking back, Everson believes that the department’s creation was properly matched to the terrifying uncertainty of the moment. Experts were warning of terrorists walking into malls with bombs strapped to their backs, he noted. From his vantage point in Washington, D.C., where the most powerful military in history had seen a jet-size hole blown into its global headquarters, that scenario that felt entirely plausible. “It wasn’t a question of if,” he said, “but when.”</p>

<h3>Shockwaves and Shortcomings</h3>
<p>The surprise unveiling of DHS sent shockwaves through the federal bureaucracy. James Tomsheck remembers the moment he saw the department’s organizational chart for the first time. “Literally it looked like a plate of spaghetti,” he told The Intercept. “There were so many lines pointing in different directions and connecting different entities of the new department.”</p>
<p>Beginning his law enforcement career as a local cop, Tomsheck had spent two and half decades rising to the senior ranks of the Secret Service. With the creation of DHS, he would serve as the contact point between the service and the “new department.” Bit by bit, as he learned more about how the new arrangement came together, he grew increasingly concerned.</p>
<!-- BLOCK(photo)[11](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PHOTO%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22RESOURCE%22%7D)(%7B%22scroll%22%3Afalse%2C%22align%22%3A%22center%22%2C%22width%22%3A%221024px%22%7D) --><div class="img-wrap align-center  width-fixed" style="width: 1024px;"><!-- CONTENT(photo)[11] -->

<p>As Tomsheck saw it, the foundational problems with DHS were two-fold. First, it was conceived in a vacuum. Based on his interactions, he concluded that the Gang of Five were “very nice, very smart people, none of which had a clue how to execute a law enforcement mission.” He added: “They made a lot of mistakes because the department was created in a vacuum without any input from those that would execute the mission.” Second, once the wheels were publicly in motion, the voices shaping the creation of the largest domestic law enforcement agency in the history of the country were often those of U.S. military officials.</p>
<p>“A lot of good people that came from the Navy, the Coast Guard, a lot of Marines, more than a few Army — generals and admirals,” Tomsheck said. “Smart people that had served our country well but had never been involved in the execution of law enforcement and had no idea how to relate to law enforcement organizations.”</p>
<p>DHS officially began operations on January 24, 2003, becoming the largest agency in the federal government after the military. Ridge was sworn in that day. From the start, there were questions as to whether the new department could carry out its core missions.</p>
<p>In the wake of 9/11, lawmakers were intensely focused on improving information sharing between the FBI and the CIA. The new department was supposed to address the issue. One of the great ironies of DHS, however, is that despite the central role that the intelligence sharing problem played in justifying its creation, the department would never have the authority or institutional weight to meaningfully influence the relationship between the country’s premier law enforcement and intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>Four days after Ridge was sworn in, Bush announced the creation of a new <a href="https://www.dni.gov/index.php/nctc-who-we-are/history">Terrorist Threat Integration Center</a> that would specifically exist to synthesize FBI and CIA intelligence sharing — it would not fall under DHS. Ridge learned of the news from watching the president’s speech.</p>

<p>In place of a reckoning, the FBI and CIA became flush with cash, swagger, and congressional support. When DHS officials proposed naming one of their new agencies “Investigation and Criminal Enforcement,” then-FBI director Robert Mueller quickly shot it down, telling an aide: “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2005/12/22/departments-mission-was-undermined-from-start/df1251f0-c7f7-442c-b71a-92a57a2351f0/">Over my dead body</a>.” The bureau forced the agency to drop an investigation into terrorism funding and even got Ridge to sign a memo committing that DHS components would not undertake similar operations going forward. That agency became Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>
<p>In the coming years, the DHS brand of counterterrorism for many Americans became synonymous with inconvenient and at times discriminatory airport experiences. Congress, meanwhile, would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/03/us/inquiry-cites-flaws-in-regional-counterterrorism-offices.html">eventually find</a> that DHS fusion centers, one of the core components of the department’s efforts to improve information sharing among local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies, almost never produced valuable intelligence despite more than $1 billion in funding.</p>
<p>Perhaps most concerning, when elements of DHS did disseminate information on domestic threats, they sometimes found themselves in serious trouble. That was the case for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2017/08/21/i-warned-of-right-wing-violence-in-2009-it-caused-an-uproar-i-was-right/">Daryl Johnson</a>. A domestic terrorism expert in the department’s intelligence office, Johnson and his team wrote a report in 2009 warning that the election of the nation’s first Black president could ignite a wave of far-right organizing, particularly around issues related to the border and immigration and blowback from wars abroad. Under pressure from Republicans, DHS quashed the report. Johnson and his team lost their jobs.</p>
<p>Allegations of <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/09/12/homeland-security-whistleblower-corruption/">high-level DHS intelligence meddling</a> continued as recently last year, with a top DHS official reporting that the heads of the department pressured his office to <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/07/15/george-floyd-protests-police-far-right-antifa/">exaggerate threats related to anti-fascists and downplay those related to the far right</a> to legitimize Trump’s domestic political agenda.</p>

<h3>A Matter of National Security</h3>
<p>DHS won several turf battles in the early post-9/11 era, but it had seemingly lost the war. Elbowed out of the counterterrorism big leagues, department officials turned their attention elsewhere, casting other elements of their operations as components of the global campaign against “Al Qaeda and associated forces.”</p>
<p>Thankfully for its most high-level proponents, this conceptual flexibility had been written into DHS’s DNA. In testimony he gave to the Senate in 2002, Ridge said that “the war on terrorism can only be conducted if we are all engaged as troops in that effort.” He also <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-107shrg80607/html/CHRG-107shrg80607.htm">linked</a> the department’s No. 1 priority — stopping another terror attack — to the nation’s borders: “Because terrorism is a global threat, we must have complete control over who and what enters the United States.”</p>
<p>In the two decades prior to 9/11, the Border Patrol had been steadily growing in size while embracing an increasingly militarized posture in the Southwest through its close relationship to the Pentagon in the war on drugs. By 2004, DHS officials, “citing concerns about terrorists crossing the nation’s borders,” had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/11/world/threats-responses-immigration-us-give-border-patrol-agents-power-deport-illegal.html">given</a> the agency “sweeping new powers to deport illegal aliens from the frontiers with Mexico and Canada without providing them the opportunity to make their case before an immigration judge.” The following summer, Congress <a href="https://www.govexec.com/defense/2005/07/border-patrol-launches-national-hiring-campaign/19574/">authorized</a> hiring 10,000 new agents over the next five years.</p>
<p>Ridge announced his retirement from DHS in November 2004, before the hiring surge truly took off. Chertoff, his successor, shared the view that undocumented immigration was a clear national security threat and made it the department’s core mission to do something about it.</p>
<p>As head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, Chertoff had spent much of 9/11 holed up inside FBI headquarters examining leads. In the two years that followed, he co-authored the Patriot Act and became one of the early legal architects of Bush’s emerging war on terror. In 2003, he was appointed as a judge on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where he remained until 2005, when the White House came calling.</p>
<p>“Leaving the bench for a job in executive branch is not something that would normally be attractive,” Chertoff told The Intercept. “But because I had been very much involved in the immediate response to 9/11, I felt a special obligation to follow through on what I had lived through those first couple of years.”</p>
<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[14](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22right%22%7D) --><blockquote class="stylized pull-right" data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="right"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[14] -->“The president believes — and I agree — that illegal immigration threatens our communities and our national security.&#8221;<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[14] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[14] -->
<p>Chertoff found a department in disarray on multiple levels. “You never have time to collect your thoughts because there are dozens of things coming at you,” he said of his feelings at the time. Chertoff quickly turned his attention to immigration and the border, issuing a <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/department-six-point-agenda">six-point agenda</a> for whipping the department into shape. That fall, in his first appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee as secretary, he delivered a report on the state of his efforts.</p>
<p>Since 9/11, the Bush administration had deported “several million” undocumented immigrants, Chertoff <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/chertoff_testimony_10_18_05.pdf">testified</a>. Border security spending had increased by nearly 60 percent, rising to $2.7 billion a year. That very day, he said, Bush’s signing of a DHS appropriations bill would open more than $890 million to CBP and ICE alone.</p>
<p>The goal, the secretary told lawmakers, was the immediate removal of all undocumented individuals crossing the border and the construction of the “tough enforcement regime” throughout the interior of the country.</p>
<p>“The president believes — and I agree — that illegal immigration threatens our communities and our national security,” Chertoff testified.</p>

<h3>The Surge</h3>
<p>When the twin towers fell in 2001, the Border Patrol had just over 9,000 agents. By the end of the Bush administration, it had twice that.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/10/border-patrol-the-green-monster-112220/">a lowering of hiring standards and a relaxation of background checks</a>, it was the largest expansion of a law enforcement agency in the shortest amount of time ever, and it made CBP the biggest domestic policing agency in the world. By the time President Barack Obama left office, there were 21,000 Border Patrol agents, the vast majority posted in the Southwest. An agency that had a $326 million budget in 1992 had <a href="https://bmi.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/publication-files/Border%20Enforcement%20Developments%20Since%201993%20and%20How%20to%20Change%20CBP.pdf">a $4.7 billion budget</a> in 2019. The eye-popping figures reflect the spending bonanza that accompanied post-9/11 homeland security — as Ridge later <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/10/border-patrol-the-green-monster-112220/">told</a> Politico, describing the early days of DHS, “People just wanted to give me unlimited amounts of money.”</p>
<p>As the Border Patrol’s ranks swelled, DHS applied a battlefield mindset to the agency’s area of operations, building “forward operating bases” — austere Border Patrol operations centers — north of the international divide. The department expanded the Border Patrol&#8217;s network of vehicle checkpoints. Armed federal agents — who, thanks to legislation from the Cold War, enjoyed sweeping powers to conduct warrantless searches of people and things within 100 miles of the nation’s boundaries — were posted along highways with orders to scrutinize the nationality of passing motorists.</p>
<p>Ostensibly meant to make border apprehensions easier, the checkpoints altered the texture of day-to-day life in border communities across the Southwest. In addition to <a href="https://www.texasobserver.org/checkpoint-nation/">systematic civil liberties violations</a> against border residents and American citizens, <a href="https://www.strausscenter.org/wp-content/uploads/Migrant_Deaths_South_Texas-1.pdf">researchers have found</a> correlations between the checkpoint interdiction strategy and the unprecedented post-9/11 explosion in migrant deaths on the border.</p>
<p>Just as the war on terror spawned a network of detention centers abroad, where individuals deemed a threat to the homeland could be housed indefinitely, DHS did the same at home. Like the wars, it was a system built on private contractors. Two months after the attacks, comments by Steve Logan, CEO of the private prison company Cornell Companies, which was later bought by the industry giant GEO Group, captured the thinking of the time.</p>
<p>“It’s clear that since September 11, there’s a heightened focus on detention, both on the borders and in the U.S.,” Logan said in a call with investors. “Federal business is the best business for us. It’s the most consistent business for us, and the events of September 11 is increasing that business.”</p>

<p>Three million people were <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/map-the-u-s-immigration-detention-boom/">shuttled through</a> the U.S. immigration detention system in the decade that followed, as private immigration detention went from an industry that barely existed prior to 2001 to a $3 billion-a-year cash cow with a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/nation/2019/12/19/ice-detention-private-prisons-expands-under-trump-administration/4393366002/">well-documented history of horrific abuse and negligence</a>. For men, women, and children detained in the borderlands, entry into this apparatus nearly always entailed passing through an <em>hielera</em>, or ice box — cold, border jail cells absent of furniture or privacy. Like immigration detention centers more broadly, illness, physical and sexual abuse, and even deaths have been a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-obtains-documents-showing-widespread-abuse-child-immigrants-us-custody">persistent problem</a> in the notorious facilities.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2006, Tomsheck retired from the Secret Service and moved over to CBP, where he soon became the agency’s top internal affairs official. For Tomsheck, this second window into the post-9/11 evolution of homeland security in America was far more disturbing than the first.</p>
<p>In the years after the Border Patrol hiring surge, CBP saw an average of nearly one employee a day <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/10/border-patrol-the-green-monster-112220">arrested on misconduct charges</a>, a rate that far outpaced any other law enforcement agency in the country. In 2012, the FBI deemed corruption inside the nation’s post-9/11 homeland security agencies its No. 1 domestic criminal priority.</p>
<p>By that point, Tomsheck had already filed a <a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/murphy_wb_dhs_oig_complaint9.8.20.pdf">whistleblower complaint</a> accusing top DHS officials of pressuring his office to redefine corruption so that CBP’s numbers wouldn’t be so high. Tomsheck refused and was pushed out of the agency in 2014. He has since <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/12/27/border-patrol-trump-biden-politics/">described</a> the CBP hiring surge as “the greatest compromise of law enforcement integrity our country has ever seen.” Earlier this year, Tomsheck and two former senior DHS colleagues went on the record with sworn statements describing an entrenched pattern of senior Border Patrol leadership covering abuses in use-of-force cases, <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2021/02/04/border-patrol-killing-impunity-iachr/">particularly cases of lethal force</a>.</p>
<p>These days, Tomsheck said, whenever he sees a story of some local or state law enforcement official accused of excessive force, he finds himself thinking about 9/11, the nation’s response to terrorism then and after, and the mentality that DHS fostered.</p>
<p>“Those three things together have created this militaristic mindset on the part of many state and local law enforcement officers — that they are every day going to work mentally prepared to engage with terrorists, forgetting that 99.9 percent of the time they’re functioning as local law enforcement officers, a difficult and often dangerous job,” he said. “But they’re not fighting a war.”</p>

<h3>The Path Forward</h3>
<p>In the mid-2000s, while he was attending law school on the East Coast, César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández made a visit home that he would not forget.</p>
<p>Though García grew up in McAllen, Texas, the Mexican city of Reynosa, just across the border, was like a second home; it was where his siblings were born, and it was where they were all headed for lunch when they saw the steel bollards of the border wall rising out of the banks of the Rio Grande for the first time.</p>
<p>“We just stared at it silently,” García told The Intercept. It felt like a message straight from the U.S. government, he said, a warning about the dangerous people on the other side of the divide. It was in that moment García understood that life as he knew it had changed, and things wouldn’t be going back to the way they were before, maybe ever.</p>
<p>García finished school and began making his way as a legal scholar during the Obama years, when DHS carried out a record <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/23/opinion/sunday/immigration-reform-biden.html">3 million deportations</a> — even Trump, despite his best efforts, was unable to break Obama’s record. Today, he is a law professor at Ohio State University and one the nation’s leading experts on the intersection of criminal and immigration law. Like border militarization more broadly, “crimmigration,” as experts in the field call it, was gathering momentum in the decades before 9/11 and rocketed into the stratosphere with the creation of DHS.</p>
<p>“Without question, it is thrown into overdrive in the aftermath of September 11,” García said. “All of the sudden, targeting migrants became a part of how presidential administrations thought of their obligation to protect the nation.”</p>
<p>If ever there was an opportunity to break from this tradition, it may have been post-Trump. For many Americans, the Trump years were a horrifying introduction to the extraordinary system of immigration enforcement that has been built over the past two decades.</p>

<p>So far, Alejandro Mayorkas, President Joe Biden’s DHS secretary, has continued the most sweeping border restriction of the Trump era: Title 42, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention measure that’s been used to <a href="https://27m3p2uv7igmj6kvd4ql3cct5h3sdwrsajovkkndeufumzyfhlfev4qd.onion/2020/09/05/us-mexico-border-coronavirus/">summarily expel</a> upward of 1 million migrants, including asylum-seekers, without a hearing. The policy has caused a bottleneck of vulnerable people in the border’s most dangerous cities. In August, the organization Human Rights First documented <a href="https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/press-release/new-report-finds-biden-administration-s-embrace-title-42-expulsions-leading-human">more than 6,300 cases of violent attacks</a> targeting individuals waiting at the border in the first seven months of the Biden administration.</p>

<p>At its peak under Trump, DHS was detaining an average of roughly 55,000 immigrants on any given day. After waves of infections, deaths, and detention releases resulting from Covid-19, that number dropped to a record low of 14,000 individuals earlier this year. In recent months, however, those numbers have been <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hamedaleaziz/ice-detainee-numbers-increasing-biden">shooting back up</a>.</p>
<p>“That was the most promising moment in the last 20 years,” García said. “The Biden administration has allowed that to evaporate.”</p>
<p>Among the founding and former officials who spoke to The Intercept, the legacy of DHS remains largely celebrated. Acknowledging that there were bumps along the road, most pointed to the absence of another 9/11-like event as evidence of the department’s success; none supported its wholesale dismantling. “You’re going to have a fragmented homeland security,” Chertoff said. “Everything is going to be just thrown up in the air, and you’re going to spend a lot of time trying to coordinate things that right now actually are coordinated.”</p>
<p>For many whose communities now exist in the shadow of the border wall, the mark that DHS has left since 9/11 looks somewhat different. “Under Republican and Democratic administrations, the wall gets longer, and it gets taller, and the surveillance gets more intense, and we continue to view migrants as dangerous and immigration as threatening,” García said. “It&#8217;s a road which has no end.”</p>
